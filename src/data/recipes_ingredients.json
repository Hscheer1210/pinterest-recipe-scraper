      "I love making salads that include protein. This shrimp avocado salad is **healthy, filling, satisfying, and light**. It's a well-balanced meal that combines veggies (avocado and arugula), protein (shrimp), a small amount of your favorite fruit (I used mango), and nuts (I used pine nuts). It's **super-versatile and flexible**, and you can use a wide variety of ingredients and substitutions (see more on that below the recipe card). I've made it so many times this Summer because it definitely became one of my family's most requested salads! This recipe is a great way to dress up and give so much flavor to **the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp**. Or cook raw shrimp from scratch using one of my recipes: [shrimp scampi with capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/) or [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)",
      "This light and refreshing salad takes under 20 minutes to make, which is great for busy weeknights. You only need **6 main ingredients** - shrimp, avocado, spinach, mango, pine nuts, and red onions.  The salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). Shrimp avocado salad also makes a stunning presentation - perfect for sharing with the crowd! **Bring this Summer salad to picnics, potlucks, barbecue parties, and other outdoor Summer festivities.** Or, serve it indoors for those special occasions when you want to impress your guests without spending too much time in the kitchen.",
      "*   **Packed with nutrients.** Shrimp avocado salad combines so many good-for-you ingredients. It's highly nutritious, packed with fiber and protein, and low in calories. It's gluten-free and dairy-free. It's also pescatarian - perfect for vegetarians who incorporate seafood into their diets.  It will make a delicious healthy addition to the list of your family's favorites.",
      "*   **Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice."

      "¼ cup red onions thinly sliced",
      "⅓ cup pine nuts toasted",

      "Heat a large, high-sided, skillet until hot on medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil - it should run easily but not sizzle or burn. Add 1 pound of raw shrimp (peeled, deveined, tails off) without overcrowding. You might have to cook it in 2 batches. Sprinkle shrimp with seasonings to taste (Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper).",
      "Cook shrimp, flipping it once or twice, on medium heat, about 3-4 minutes total, until pink in color. Do not overcook.",
      "Remove shrimp from the skillet.",
      "For a more detailed recipe on how to cook raw shrimp, refer to this recipe: [shrimp scampi](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/).",
      "Preheat oven to 350 F. Spread pine nuts on a baking sheet in a single layer and roast in the oven for about 5 minutes until they turn a rich golden color.",
      "Watch the nuts at all times as they burn really quickly.",
      "**Seafood.** This recipe works great with shrimp, scallops, cooked lobster meat, and lump crab meat.",
      "**Greens.** I used arugula which adds a nice, peppery flavor. You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.",
      "**Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.",
      "**Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad. I recommend mango, peaches, nectarines, and apricots. You can also add citrus fruit which will pair well with shrimp, such as oranges, mandarine oranges, or grapefruit.",
      "**Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice.",
      "**Use pre-cooked shrimp.** It saves so much time, and this avocado salad is just a great way to dress up the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp.",
      "**Any size of shrimp works.** I do prefer to use large, but this is a great recipe to use up smaller cooked shrimp!",
      "**Cook shrimp from scratch.** If you have raw shrimp, simply cook it on the stovetop. Here is a nice, light recipe for [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/).",
      "**Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!",
      "**Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.",
      "**A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.",
      "**An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.",
      "If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.",
      "Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.",
      "The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.",

      "This little recipe isn’t complicated, doesn’t pretend to be something else. It has always been there in times when my grandmother knew she had to feed us cousins something we would actually eat after school. Using what she had in her pantry she created this easy meat sauce, but her hand was heavy and she often overseasoned. The large amount of pepper is what we as kids came to love and crave, even though we are now spread out around the world and it’s 20 years later. I’ve had many requests for the recipe, but struggled to share something I knew that Italian nonna’s might critcize for not being authentic. It is just a basic recipe that my South African grandma made from her heart, so please adjust whatever you like to your taste. The cloves aren’t really optional because it gives this dish that signature South African flavor (clove, mace, cinnamon and nutmeg are hugely popular ingredients in savory meat dishes!), just be sure to scoop it out before serving :) I can’t tell you how many times she forgot, and had one of us very shocked after biting into one. If you prefer some spice, add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and some hot smoked paprika. If you follow a vegetarian diet, I recommend trying plant based protein like Beyond products or soy mince. Burrata is entirely optional, you could either leave it out or use a nice shaving of Parmesan cheese."

      "**Slow cooker** – Whether you have a slow cooker or crockpot, the directions are the same.",
      "**Large skillet** – For sautéing the chicken.",
      "**Wooden spoon –** I prefer wooden utensils because they do not scratch the ceramic in my slow cooker.",
      "**Chicken –** I use skinless boneless chicken thighs because they are easy to prepare, and my family prefers white meat. Whatever meat you use, just cut it into two-inch cubes.",
      "**Yogurt**—Plain Greek yogurt is my preference for this marinade. It adds a nice, mellow acid with a mild, creamy flavor.",
      "**Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.",
      "**Garlic powder**—I put garlic powder in just about everything, and it is perfect for marinating chicken because it is concentrated and will add more garlic taste.",
      "**Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.",
      "**Turmeric –** A popular curry spice, turmeric adds an earthy background with hints of pepper, ginger, and sweetness. Some say it tastes similar to mustard. It can also be somewhat bitter if you use too much.",
      "**Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.",
      "**Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red chili powder and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.",
      "**Paprika –** Gives your marinade a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.",
      "**Salt**—I prefer to use sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.",
      "**Olive oil –** I always use extra virgin olive oil because it is light and has a mild flavor**.** In this recipe, it is used to sauté the chicken.",
      "**Butter**—Because butter is the star of this dish, I only use the highest-quality butter without salt. If your butter has salt, remove it from the sauce ingredients.",
      "**Onion –** Minced and sauteed to add a fresh onion flavor without any bitterness that the powder has.",
      "**Garlic –** Also minced and sauteed, fresh garlic gives your sauce a deep, rich garlic taste.",
      "**Tomato sauce**—Another important ingredient. I prefer to use organic tomatoes to make my own, but you can use your favorite brand.",
      "**Evaporated milk –** Any kind of evaporated milk will do, but the better the quality, the better the flavor.",
      "**Heavy cream**—Do not substitute this ingredient unless you really have to because it gives your sauce the creaminess it needs to taste authentic.",
      "**Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.",
      "**Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.",

      "**Paprika –** Gives your sauce a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.",
      "**Salt**—I prefer sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.",
      "**Black pepper –** Grind your own from fresh peppercorns for the best taste.",
      "**Sugar –** I use granulated white sugar for sweetness, but you could use honey or maple syrup.",
      "**Different cuts:** Instead of skinless boneless chicken breast, you could also use thighs. Dark meat has a more robust flavor and is always juicy.",
      "**Different meat:** If your butcher does not have fresh organic chicken, you could use a different meat. I have tried pork, turkey. They are all truly delicious in their way.",
      "**Cheesy butter chicken:** Another way to change this recipe is to add some shredded cheese. I have tried cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.",
      "**Make it spicy:** Even with the garam masala and chili powder, this dish is not that spicy. If you want to add some heat, add red pepper flakes to the marinade and toss chopped jalapenos into the sauce.",
      "To make this a whole meal in one pot, add some baby red potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.",
      "I like to serve my saucy butter chicken on top of some [perfect fluffy rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/how-to-cook-perfect-rice-in-the-instant-pot/) and garlic naan on the side.",
      "Any kind of side dish would pair nicely with this dish, but for an Indian theme, try it with chutney, chana masala, naan, or [grilled eggplant](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-eggplant-recipe/).",
      "Add a light salad on the side, like this [strawberry broccoli salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/strawberry-broccoli-salad-recipe/) or [grilled zucchini salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-zucchini-salad-recipe/).",
      "To help soak that delicious sauce, serve with some crusty French bread or rolls like my [Amish potato dinner rolls](https://urls.grow.me/https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/amish-potato-dinner-rolls-recipe/%23growSource=search&growReferrer=true).",
      "**Refrigerate:** After cooled to room temperature, put your crockpot butter chicken in a sealed container. It will stay fresh for up to 10 days.",
      "**Freezing:** If you want to keep it longer, you must freeze it. Once it has cooled, pour it into a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, and it can stay frozen for four to six months.",
      "**Defrost:** Remove your frozen leftovers from the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you plan to serve them.",
      "**Reheating:** Heat in a saucepan on the stove for 10 minutes or in the microwave for one or two minutes.",
      "To easily remove cardamom pods after cooking, use a needle and thread to tie them together. Then, before serving, lift the thread out to remove all the pods at once.",
      "If your chicken is too thin, add some cornstarch slurry and heat it a little longer. You can make a slurry by mixing one tablespoon of cornstarch with one cup of warm water.",
      "If it has an acid taste, add another tablespoon of sugar or honey.",
      "I usually double the sauce recipe because I like to use it when reheating. It also tastes great on tacos, pasta, and bread.",

      "**Use a thin spatula:** It’s best to use a thin spatula to lift the peaches from underneath. Using tongs to flip peaches on the grill can sometimes rip the grill marks apart.",
      "**Outdoor grill, stovetop grill pan, or indoor electric grill:** I prefer cast iron, but if you’re worried about the fruit sticking to the grill, you can use a nonstick.",
      "**Fresh peaches:** They should be ripe but firm. They need to be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but also relatively firm so that they don’t fall apart on the grill. The larger the peaches, the better.",
      "**Olive oil:** Brushing the peaches with olive oil helps prevent sticking.",
      "**Berries:** Use any fresh berries of your choice. Blackberries are my favorite for this recipe.",
      "**Mixed greens:** Choose a variety of mixed greens such as baby spinach, arugula, and romaine lettuce for texture.",

Using a meat mallet or the bottom of your fry pan, pound breasts to even thickness (you don't want the meat super-flat, just even in thickness).

Generously oil the grill (I drench a roll-up paper towel in vegetable oil and, holding it with tongs, rub it over the grill grates. Don't skip this step.) Start by grilling the pineapple **(See Note 1)** so you can work on the salsa while the chicken cooks. Rub about 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil over all sides of the pineapple. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.",
      "Remove chicken from marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.",
      "While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.",

      "**The anti-inflammatory trio:** aka fresh garlic, ginger and [turmeric](https://amzn.to/33RpzKE).

On your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine.  Now, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.  Next, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.",
      "Now, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture and once the dough starts to look like ... dough .... start kneeding it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. Then form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.",
      "After that hour has passed and you are ready to make your pumpkin ravioli, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. Add in the parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.",
      "On your countertop or a large cutting board, unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.",
      "At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray. Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well. Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells. Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli. Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed. Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray. The ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.",
      "Add your fresh ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.",

      "Place the potato slices in a medium saucepan and cover with water, add a dash of salt. Bring them to a boil over a high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer potatoes until just fork tender, about 5-8 minutes once boiling.",
      "Drain the potatoes and rinse in cold water to stop them from cooking.",
      "Once cooled and drained, gently toss with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil (you need just enough to coat all the potatoes, but you don't want too much or it'll cause a flare up on the grill), and a dash each of salt and pepper, so they are all evenly coated.",
      "Preheat the grill to medium-high. Add the potatoes to a nonstick grill pan, basket or wok, and place on the grill over the flames. Since the potatoes will not be in a single layer, you will want to toss them gently and often so some don't burn while others don't get browned. It will take approximately 20 minutes to cook all of the potatoes thoroughly and for them to be nicely browned. If any get caught in a hot spot and cook too quickly or begin to burn a bit, I just remove them early. If you don't want to mess with a grill basket or pan, you can cut the potatoes the long way and cook them directly on your grill in a single layer, this takes only about 5 minutes per side. (Our grill's grates are a bit too wide and we lose too many this way, so to avoid frustration we go with the pan).",
      "While the potatoes are cooking, in a small bowl add the rice wine vinegar, the remaining Terra Delyssa olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, salt and pepper, mix well to combine.",
      "Once the potatoes are cooked, place them in a large serving bowl, add the arugula and dressing, gently toss to combine everything. The arugula will begin to wilt a bit with the heat from the potatoes but will keep that nice crunch. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Serve."

      "Tomatillos are a member of the nightshade family. They are wrapped in a wrinkly paper husk, and once you remove the outer layer a gorgeous candy-apple green colored fruit appears. You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.",
      "Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.",
      "To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.",

      "Pre-heat oven to 425°F. Remove the paper off of the tomatillos and place them on a large baking pan. Add jalapeño peppers, pasilla chilies and cut red onion to the same pan.",
      "Drizzle the chilies with one tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
      "Place the peeled garlic in foil, lightly drizzle with oil and wrap into a packet that is open from the top, place on the corner of the baking pan. Roast chilies, onion, and garlic for 40 minutes stirring chilies after 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa and chicken.",
      "Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.",
      "Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.",
      "Add 1 cup quinoa to a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse well with running water. Transfer to a pot with lid. Add 2 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt.",
      "Bring to a boil, put a lid on then reduce to a simmer, over medium-low heat. Allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until water is absorbed, then turn off the heat. Allow it to sit with the lid on for at least 5 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork when ready to serve.",
      "Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side, or until chicken is no longer pink. Transfer to a clean plate.",
      "Once slightly cooled shred chicken into smaller pieces. Transfer to the saute pan that has 2 cups of tomatillo sauce. Turn heat to medium and warm chicken and sauce until hot. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons yogurt. Taste season with more salt and pepper as desired.",
      "Assemble bowls with quinoa, add tomatillo chicken and other desired toppings.",
      "**Additional Topping Suggestions**: Sliced limes, radishes, cilantro, diced onion, tomatoes, black beans, sour cream, and avocado."

      "Have you tried steak seasoning? It’s not just for steak! This seasoning is really great on the zucchini.",
      "Even beyond a great finger food, they’re definitely lighter than potatoes. These zucchini fries are baked and all the wonderful flavors get cooked into the zucchini. Each bite is wonderful and low carb!",
      "All recipe details are in the recipe box below.",
      "Crushed pork rinds are probably the most common and popular. You can buy these pre-crushed and ready to use. Or you can buy a bag of pork rinds and then grind them in your food processor. This option allows you to customize the grind of your pork rinds. You can make the coating find or more coarse/crunchy.",
      "Almond flour is another popular option. But we find that the parmesan cheese and crushed pork rinds will result in the most crispy outside texture. If you don’t use enough oil spray on the outside of the almond flour, the crust can be rather mushy and dry.",
      "Sesame seeds are another option. You’ll get a great flavor of sesame on the zucchini.",

      "Spread the pesto equally on the 4 slices of bread and place two slices of bread on the panini maker or in a toaster oven for 2 minutes.",
      "Then place the mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers on top of two bread slices and allow the cheese to melt and the veggies to soften, keeping the panini maker open.",
      "Once the cheese starts to melt, add the second slices on top to close the sandwiches, then close the panini maker for 2-3 minutes. Remove, slice in half and serve immediately",
      "_Instead whole mozzarella_, you can use shredded mozzarella. Although I think it creates a completely different flavor and texture to the sandwich.",
      "_Instead of walnuts_, you can use other nuts, like pine nuts, almonds or pecans, to make the pesto"

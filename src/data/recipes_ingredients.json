      "**Slice breasts in half before grilling**: Slice and/or pound your chicken breasts into evenly thick pieces before grilling. That way they’ll cook quicker and evenly. They’ll also be the perfect size when diced for these Peanut Chicken Lettuce Wraps.",
      "**Generously oil your grill grates**. I do this by rolling up a few paper towels, drenching them in oil (canola or vegetable), and while using tongs, I rub the drenched paper towels along the grill grates. Doing this will contribute to a beautiful sear, and ensure the chicken doesn’t stick to the grates.",
      "**Let the cooked chicken rest:** Chicken needs to rest, tented with foil, for 5-10 minutes before cutting in. This helps the juices redistribute inside the chicken, rather than leaking out.",
      "**Turmeric tip:** Turmeric has a brilliant yellow/orange color and will dye your hands, table, cutting board, and even your kids the same bright color, so don’t use it on surfaces you don’t want to be scrubbing forever after making this meal.",
      "**Lettuce**: I recommend using **butter** **(Boston) lettuce**. It has a nice flavor, a good amount of crispness, and rolls up nicely.",
      "**Carrots**: Use a bag of **matchstick** **carrots** if you’re in a hurry. I love the flavor and crispiness of **whole** **carrots**, so I use them to make my own matchstick carrots. However, that takes an extra few minutes, so use whatever method you have time for.",
      "**Cucumbers**: I highly recommend using **Persian** or **English** **cucumbers** since they’re much crispier than regular cucumbers. In these wraps, crispiness is important.",
      "**Red** **pepper**: Any sweet bell pepper works; red, orange, or yellow. You can even leave out the pepper and use extra carrots or cucumber if you prefer.",

      "**Chopped peanuts or cashews**: I like getting **roasted and salted** nuts for these wraps. They add the perfect finishing touch and replace the need for salt.",
      "**Fresh cilantro**: Chop right before serving or just grab a few full stems and add them right on top.",
      "**Fresh** **lime**: I usually serve these wraps with a few lime wedges on the side so everyone can add a few squeezes of fresh lime right before eating. I intentionally didn’t add lime juice to the sauce because I planned for it here.",

Cook on the preheated grill until the chicken is golden and no longer pink in the center, about 4-5 minutes per side (or until the chicken registers 165 degrees F). Remove, cover with foil, and let stand for 5-10 minutes. When cooled slightly, dice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. **To saute the chicken instead, see Note 3.**",
      "**VEGGIES**: Prep veggies while chicken is cooking: Slice a bell pepper into small matchstick-sized pieces, cut matchstick carrots (or use prepared matchstick carrots). Cut the cucumber(s) into matchstick pieces. If you aren't using salted nuts, add a pinch of salt to the veggies. Finely chop the peanuts.",
      "**ASSEMBLY**: Wash and completely dry 12 lettuce leaves. Divide the cooked chicken evenly among the 12 lettuce leaves, followed by the veggies and peanuts. Add fresh cilantro and lime wedges to plates. Drizzle sauce generously over the wraps and enjoy immediately."

      "**Seafood.** This recipe works great with shrimp, scallops, cooked lobster meat, and lump crab meat.",
      "**Greens.** I used arugula which adds a nice, peppery flavor. You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.",
      "**Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.",
      "**Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad.

      "**Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!",
      "**Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.",
      "**A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.",
      "**An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.",
      "If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.",
      "Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.",
      "The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.",

Place the dough back into the metal mixing bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and set the bowl on top of your preheating oven. (Don't place the bowl on a burner, just on the surface of the oven. The heat will help the dough to proof/rise.) Let the dough sit for five minutes.",

      "When the dough is ready, lightly flour a flat surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a rectangular shape about the size of your pan.  Place the dough onto the baking sheet and push the dough into the corners and up to the sides. This does not need to be perfectly round or rectangular. Just be sure the dough is evenly flattened. (Repeat with the other half of the dough on a second baking sheet or pizza pan.)",

      "**Core the peppers but leave them whole.** Lay each pepper on its side and cut only the top part where the stem is.",
      "**Cook the peppers well until tender.** In Greek style stuffed peppers (and throughout the Mediterranean) the peppers must be cooked until fully tender, they can not be crunchy or taste raw in any way. To accomplish this, before they're stuffed, grill the peppers for a few minutes (gas grill or indoor griddle will work) until they gain a nice char all around (great flavor)! Then, once stuffed, the peppers finish cooking in the oven, covered. A little bit of liquid in the baking dish creates some steam that cooks the peppers until they are nice and super tender.",
      "**Extra virgin olive oil-** I used Private Reserve Greek extra virgin olive oil",
      "**Onion-** 1 small yellow onion is sauteed in extra virgin olive oil to begin making the meat mixture for the stuffing.",
      "**Ground beef**\\- ½ pound of lean ground beef (you can also use ground turkey or ground chicken). The meat will be fully browned or cooked before using in the stuffing.",
      "**Spices-** 1 teaspoon ground allspice, 1 teaspoon garlic powder (or 2 minced garlic cloves) 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika, kosher salt and black pepper to taste. The spices are used at different times in creating the stuffing or the meat and rice mixture that we use to fill the bell peppers",
      "**Chickpeas-** 1 cup of already cooked chickpeas (or from can).",
      "**Rice**\\- 1 cup of white rice. Tip: wash the rice well and let it soak in plenty of water for 20 to 30 minutes or until you are able to break one grain of rice easily. This helps cook the rice quickly and evenly.",
      "**Parsley-** 1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped (Or a mixture of chopped fresh parsley and fresh dill)",
      "**Liquid: Tomato sauce and water-** in order for the rice to cook well with the ground meat and chickpeas, you will need some liquid. ½ cup tomato sauce and 2 ½ cups of water provides that. The tomato sauce adds more of umami and a subtle color to the stuffing mixture, so don't skip it if you can. You can also use ½ cup of diced tomatoes from a can in place of the tomato sauce, if you like.",
      "**Bell peppers-** 6 large bell peppers, any color you choose. Like I mentioned earlier, you only need to remove the stem and the seeds, leaving the actual peppers pretty much whole.",
      "**Broth-** A little more liquid is needed to bake the peppers once stuffed. I like to use ¾ cup of broth or water in the baking dish.",
      "**Change up the meat.** If you like, replace ground beef with ground chicken or turkey. Adjust seasoning to your taste",
      "**Need a vegetarian stuffed peppers option?** Omit the meat all together. Cook the onions, chickpeas and rice the same way but without the meat!

Or you can make these stuffed peppers vegan by eliminating the meat all together. And to try different flavors, you can replace ground allspice with ground cumin or Italian seasoning. This is a dairy free stuffed pepper recipe, but if you want to add cheese, a sprinkle of crumbled feta added at the end is a good option.",
      "**To Prepare Ahead:** You can prepare the rice mixture one day in advance if you like by following steps #1 and #2. Let the rice cool completely before storing in the fridge. And you can also prepare the peppers per step #3. Store the peppers in the fridge separately once cooled. The next day, you can assemble the stuffed bell peppers and bake (steps #5 and #6). It may help to bring the stuffed peppers to room temperature before baking.",
      "**Can you freeze cooked stuffed peppers?** First, be sure to cool the stuffed peppers completely. You can portion and store them in freezer-safe containers and freeze for 1 to 2 months. Thaw in fridge overnight, and warm up in a medium-heated oven (it helps to add a little bit of liquid to your baking dish, and cover the peppers before placing in oven.)",

      "**It is so easy:** Marinate the chicken the night before. Then sauté the chicken and toss it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients before enjoying your day. Then, you can come back to a delicious but easy meal.",
      "**Authentic flavor:** If your goal is to serve an authentic Indian meal, this one you should definitely try.",
      "**Leftovers taste incredible:** Some recipes taste better the next day. This crockpot butter chicken is one of them. Save some for lunch or dinner tomorrow.",
      "**Make it your way:** Although I prefer this dish just the way it is, sometimes I like to mix it up by adding or removing some of the ingredients. For example, when I have people sensitive to spicy foods, I leave out chili powder and garam masala.",
      "**Slow cooker** – Whether you have a slow cooker or crockpot, the directions are the same.",
      "**Large skillet** – For sautéing the chicken.",
      "**Wooden spoon –** I prefer wooden utensils because they do not scratch the ceramic in my slow cooker.",
      "**Chicken –** I use skinless boneless chicken thighs because they are easy to prepare, and my family prefers white meat. Whatever meat you use, just cut it into two-inch cubes.",
      "**Yogurt**—Plain Greek yogurt is my preference for this marinade. It adds a nice, mellow acid with a mild, creamy flavor.",
      "**Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.",
      "**Garlic powder**—I put garlic powder in just about everything, and it is perfect for marinating chicken because it is concentrated and will add more garlic taste.",
      "**Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.",
      "**Turmeric –** A popular curry spice, turmeric adds an earthy background with hints of pepper, ginger, and sweetness. Some say it tastes similar to mustard. It can also be somewhat bitter if you use too much.",
      "**Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.",
      "**Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red chili powder and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.",
      "**Paprika –** Gives your marinade a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.",
      "**Salt**—I prefer to use sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.",
      "**Olive oil –** I always use extra virgin olive oil because it is light and has a mild flavor**.** In this recipe, it is used to sauté the chicken.",
      "**Butter**—Because butter is the star of this dish, I only use the highest-quality butter without salt. If your butter has salt, remove it from the sauce ingredients.",
      "**Onion –** Minced and sauteed to add a fresh onion flavor without any bitterness that the powder has.",
      "**Garlic –** Also minced and sauteed, fresh garlic gives your sauce a deep, rich garlic taste.",
      "**Tomato sauce**—Another important ingredient. I prefer to use organic tomatoes to make my own, but you can use your favorite brand.",
      "**Evaporated milk –** Any kind of evaporated milk will do, but the better the quality, the better the flavor.",
      "**Heavy cream**—Do not substitute this ingredient unless you really have to because it gives your sauce the creaminess it needs to taste authentic.",
      "**Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.",
      "**Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.",
      "**Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.",
      "**Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.",
      "**Paprika –** Gives your sauce a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.",
      "**Salt**—I prefer sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.",
      "**Black pepper –** Grind your own from fresh peppercorns for the best taste.",
      "**Sugar –** I use granulated white sugar for sweetness, but you could use honey or maple syrup.",
      "**Different cuts:** Instead of skinless boneless chicken breast, you could also use thighs. Dark meat has a more robust flavor and is always juicy.",
      "**Different meat:** If your butcher does not have fresh organic chicken, you could use a different meat. I have tried pork, turkey. They are all truly delicious in their way.",
      "**Cheesy butter chicken:** Another way to change this recipe is to add some shredded cheese. I have tried cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.",
      "**Make it spicy:** Even with the garam masala and chili powder, this dish is not that spicy. If you want to add some heat, add red pepper flakes to the marinade and toss chopped jalapenos into the sauce.",
      "To make this a whole meal in one pot, add some baby red potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.",
      "I like to serve my saucy butter chicken on top of some [perfect fluffy rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/how-to-cook-perfect-rice-in-the-instant-pot/) and garlic naan on the side.",
      "Any kind of side dish would pair nicely with this dish, but for an Indian theme, try it with chutney, chana masala, naan, or [grilled eggplant](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-eggplant-recipe/).",
      "Add a light salad on the side, like this [strawberry broccoli salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/strawberry-broccoli-salad-recipe/) or [grilled zucchini salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-zucchini-salad-recipe/).",
      "To help soak that delicious sauce, serve with some crusty French bread or rolls like my [Amish potato dinner rolls](https://urls.grow.me/https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/amish-potato-dinner-rolls-recipe/%23growSource=search&growReferrer=true).",
      "**Refrigerate:** After cooled to room temperature, put your crockpot butter chicken in a sealed container. It will stay fresh for up to 10 days.",
      "**Freezing:** If you want to keep it longer, you must freeze it. Once it has cooled, pour it into a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, and it can stay frozen for four to six months.",
      "**Defrost:** Remove your frozen leftovers from the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you plan to serve them.",
      "**Reheating:** Heat in a saucepan on the stove for 10 minutes or in the microwave for one or two minutes.",
      "To easily remove cardamom pods after cooking, use a needle and thread to tie them together. Then, before serving, lift the thread out to remove all the pods at once.",
      "If your chicken is too thin, add some cornstarch slurry and heat it a little longer. You can make a slurry by mixing one tablespoon of cornstarch with one cup of warm water.",
      "If it has an acid taste, add another tablespoon of sugar or honey.",
      "I usually double the sauce recipe because I like to use it when reheating. It also tastes great on tacos, pasta, and bread.",
      "When freezing, put your leftovers in small freezer-safe containers to take out just what you need when you need it.",

You don't want to dampen your breadcrumbs with excess egg because then they won't stick to the cauliflower. Then place into sheet with panko crumbs.

This should only take a few seconds. Then add cornstarch water to the sauce. Stir immediately to dissolve cornstarch into the sauce. Stir occasionally and let sauce come to a simmer (make sure to stir otherwise the cornstarch will clump up) and cook until sauce starts to thicken (about 2 minutes).",

      "The recipe above makes just enough sauce to drizzle over a small head's worth of cauliflower florets. If you are using a medium or large head of cauliflower or you wish to coat the cauliflower completely in sauce, you should double the sauce.",
      "If you make any adjustments to the sauce (i.e. add more soy sauce or other liquids) you may need to also add more cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Remember to dissolve any additional cornstarch in a little water before adding it."

Allow the dressing to sit with the kale for 15 minutes or longer to help the kale marinate with the dressing. Add in your roasted sweet potato cubes, cranberries, avocado and wasabi peas or roasted chickpeas. Give the salad a gentle toss to combine.",
      "Finally make your sweet and spicy pistachios: place pistachio in a skillet over medium heat. Toast nutes for 4-6 minutes, stirring frequently until they turn just slightly golden then turn off heat and immediately add in maple syrup, cayenne pepper and sea salt. Stir for 15 more seconds to coat pistachios, then transfer to a piece of parchment paper to cool for a few minutes. Pistachios may stick together so try to spread them in an even layer when they are cooling. Slightly chop once they’re a little cool and place them on the salad. Enjoy! Salad keeps well for 3-4 days.

      "**Potatoes:** Yukon golds or Russets.",
      "**Butter:** You want the butter to be softened but not melted. Room temperature butter will melt into the potatoes easily.",
      "**Salt and Pepper:** You’ll add some salt to the cooking water and then more salt, to taste, after cooking.",
      "**Milk:** Whole milk makes the best rich and creamy mashed potatoes, but you can use skim milk if that’s what you have on hand. Warm the milk before stirring it into the potatoes. This keeps the potatoes from cooling off too much and helps to make creamy potatoes.",
      "Start the potatoes in cold water and then bring it to a boil. Using a cold start promotes even cooking, so the outsides of the potatoes won’t overcook by the time the insides are done. Even cooking is also why you want to cut potatoes before boiling, instead of boiling them whole.",
      "Adding salt to the cooking water flavors the potatoes from the beginning. It really does make a difference!",
      "To avoid lumps, cook the potatoes until they are very soft and tender when pierced with a fork or knife. Lumpy mashed potatoes are usually caused by mashing undercooked potatoes.",
      "I recommend mashing your potatoes by hand for fluffy mashed potatoes. Using an electric mixer is easy, but it can result in a gummy or gluey texture because it makes it too easy to overwork the potatoes. The same goes for when you are mashing and stirring by hand – be careful to not overwork the potatoes.",
      "Be sure to use softened butter and warm milk (or cream).",
      "Potatoes tend to dry out over time, so **add more milk** to make them creamy again.",
      "**In the microwave:** Microwave on high power, stirring occasionally, until hot. Add more milk as needed.",
      "**In the oven:** Stir a bit of milk into the potatoes and put them in a baking dish. Cover with foil and bake at 350° F until hot, stirring once or twice.",
      "**Make ahead:** You can make this recipe up to two hours ahead and then keep the potatoes warm in a slow cooker using the warm setting.",
      "**Extra Rich and Creamy:** Instead of milk, use half and half or heavy cream for richer mashed potatoes.",
      "**Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes:** Substitute buttermilk for the milk. Do not warm the buttermilk or it may curdle. You’ll love the tangy buttermilk flavor!",
      "**Cream Cheese:** Add 4 ounces of cream cheese per 3 pounds of potatoes. Soften the cream cheese to room temperature and then mash it into the potatoes along with the butter.",
      "**Sour Cream:** Add 2 tablespoons of sour cream, plus more to taste if desired. Sour cream makes the potatoes extra creamy and adds a slightly tangy flavor.",
      "**Garlic Mashed Potatoes:** For easy garlic mashed potatoes, stir in garlic powder, starting with 1/4 teaspoon and then adding more to taste or try my [garlic mashed potatoes](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/garlic-mashed-potatoes/) recipe with [roasted garlic](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/roasted-garlic/).",
      "**Herb Mashed Potatoes:** Chives are a classic addition to mashed potatoes. Or, add other fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme or sage. If you want to add dried herbs, oregano, thyme and basil are good options.",
      "**Bacon:** Because everything is better with bacon! Cook chopped bacon in a skillet and then top mashed potatoes with the cooked bacon crumbles.",
      "**Loaded Mashed Potatoes:** The ultimate comfort food! Stir in sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, bacon crumbles and chopped chives or green onions.",

      "▢ 3 tablespoon soy sauce low sodium is good if you have",

      "▢ 1 teaspoon lime zest from one lime",

Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or 6-12 hours in fridge. _Tip: if marinating overnight, I leave out lime juice and increase zest so it doesn't 'cook' the chicken._",

      "**GRILL CHICKEN SKEWERS**: Skewer marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and _pat dry (__important__)_. Discard the marinade used for marinating. Lightly spray chicken with oil to further avoid sticking. Grill on all sides until chicken cooks to a golden brown (you'll need to turn chicken a couple of times), for 9-12 minutes in total (depending on thickness and how tightly packed the skewers are), basting once or twice with the honey lime glaze. Instant thermometer will read 160F/71C. Rest chicken, loosely covered for 5 minutes.",
      "**SERVE**: If you have any leftover sauce, drizzle it on the chicken or warm it in microwave for 30 seconds and pass it around. Sprinkle chicken with cilantro or parsley and serve with lime wedges if desired. Serve hot or at room temperature."

On your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine.  Now, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.  Next, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.",
      "Now, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture and once the dough starts to look like ... dough .... start kneeding it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. Then form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.",
      "After that hour has passed and you are ready to make your pumpkin ravioli, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. Add in the parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.",
      "On your countertop or a large cutting board, unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.",
      "At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray. Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well. Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells. Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli. Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed. Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray. The ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.",
      "Add your fresh ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.",

Generously oil the grill (I drench a roll-up paper towel in vegetable oil and, holding it with tongs, rub it over the grill grates. Don't skip this step.) Start by grilling the pineapple **(See Note 1)** so you can work on the salsa while the chicken cooks. Rub about 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil over all sides of the pineapple. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.",

Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.",
      "While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.",

I do this by rolling up a few paper towels, drenching them in oil (I use canola), and using tongs, rub the drenched paper towels along the grill grates.

Then form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.",
      "After that hour has passed and you are ready to make your pumpkin ravioli, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. Add in the parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.",
      "On your countertop or a large cutting board, unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.",
      "At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray. Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well. Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells. Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli. Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed. Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray. The ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.",
      "Add your fresh ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.",

It will take approximately 20 minutes to cook all of the potatoes thoroughly and for them to be nicely browned. If any get caught in a hot spot and cook too quickly or begin to burn a bit, I just remove them early. If you don't want to mess with a grill basket or pan, you can cut the potatoes the long way and cook them directly on your grill in a single layer, this takes only about 5 minutes per side.

      "Preheat the oven to **400 degrees F** and begin to prepare the butternut squash.",
      "To prepare the butternut squash: slice off the stems at both ends and then peel the entire squash. Slice the squash in half where the thinner end begins to widen around the middle.",
      "Slice the thick end in half and with a sharp spoon, scoop out and remove the seeds (you can roast the seeds too for a fun snack!).",
      "Dice the squash into even 1-inch cubes — **the more even your pieces, the more perfectly the squash will roast!**",
      "Toss the squash on a large sheet pan with just **the right amount of olive oil** (I’ve found 4 cups to 2 tablespoons is perfect!), salt & pepper, and a few other spices. Make sure to **spread the squash into one even layer**. If the squash is crammed, it will end up steaming instead of roasting.",
      "Cook in the preheated oven and toss after 10 minutes to get an even roasting!",
      "**Yes**!! You can prepare the couscous, roasted butternut squash, and dressing for 4 consecutive days.",
      "**To prepare for meal prep**: add cooked and cooled couscous and cooked and cooled roasted butternut squash into 4 equal meal prep containers. Divide the dressing equally among 4 smaller containers and place in each meal prep container. Place the pecans in reusable bags in each container. Each morning/afternoon before eating, add some fresh sliced avocado and fresh arugula (if desired). Toss everything with the dressing and enjoy!",
      "**Roasted Butternut Squash**: butternut squash is a powerhouse ingredient! It’s got a ton of **potassium** which can help decrease blood pressure, it’s loaded with **vitamin** **A** which is super important for healthy eyesight, has a good amount of **vitamin** **C** which has been linked to healthier skin, and is linked to anti-inflammatory effects. In addition to the many benefits, it’s also low in calories and almost no fat (less than 100 calories with 26 carbohydrates in 1 cup).",
      "**Avocado**: although bananas are known for their potassium, did you know avocados have even more **potassium** in them?! They pack 14% of the recommended daily allowance of potassium while bananas are at 10%. There are lots of studies linking a high potassium intake to reduce blood pressure which correlates reduced risk of heart attacks, strokes, and/or kidney failure.",
      "**Pecans**: in just one ounce of pecans you’ll be getting 3 grams of **fiber**, 3 grams of **protein**, and 20 grams of mostly **unsaturated** **fats** (the healthy fats!) which makes these nuts satisfying and hearty with lots of benefits. Pecans provide phytonutrients which have powerful antioxidant benefits (antioxidants help to ward off disease/illness). Pecans are also packed with **vitamin** **E** which has been linked to lowering the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.",

      "**Chicken**. Originally I made the recipe with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, but since I only have that in my refrigerator once a year, I updated today’s version to use cooked, shredded chicken instead. If you need an easy way to make it, check out my [How to Cook Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-shredded-chicken/) for my favorite easy, foolproof method. [Crock Pot Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/crock-pot-shredded-chicken/) and [Baked Chicken Breast](https://www.wellplated.com/baked-chicken-breast/) are also great.",
      "**Sweet Potatoes**. I almost always have one or two of these sweet orange beauties in my pantry. They are a quick and healthy add to almost any fall or winter dinner.",
      "**Kale**. Sturdy kale is ideal for stir-fry and skillet-type recipes like this because it can hold up to the heat and other bold flavors. The amount called for will seem like a lot at first, but it will cook down significantly.",
      "**Goat Cheese**. Crumbled goat cheese melts into the nooks and crannies, makes the recipe creamy, and gives the dish just enough indulgence to make it taste satisfying. I like to stir in half, then leave the rest to crumble on top so that I get delightful little pockets of it with every forkful.",
      "**Balsamic Vinegar**. When I was first cooking this dish, I tasted it at the end and felt it lacked a little pop. A splash of balsamic vinegar did the trick! It brightens up the ingredients and balances the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes.",
      "**Fresh Herbs**. Use any mix of sage, rosemary, and thyme, all of which seem to make their way in and out of my refrigerator this time of year. I really recommend fresh over dried (dried doesn’t have the same wonderful effect). Look for the poultry herb mix, which usually offers all three.",
      "**Dried Cranberries or Pomegranate**. I love adding a handful of these little jewels anytime I’m doing a fall-themed recipe. The first time I used pomegranate seeds because we happened to have some leftover. The second I used dried cranberries, because we always have them around and I wanted to see how the dish would taste with more of a pantry staple. Answer: both are delicious! Feel free to choose your favorite.",
      "**Rice**. This dish is yummy on its own, but I loved it most with a [brown and wild rice mix blend like this one](https://amzn.to/2UoNZ8A). If you’re looking to keep things low carb, try cauliflower rice.",
      "**Bread**. I also suspect this recipe would be delicious paired with thick slices of good-quality crusty bread.",

      "**Brussels Sprouts:** choose the freshest sprouts you can find. In their peak season, you can often find Brussels sprouts still attached to the stalk. Those are great! But they’re not essential. For the freshest Brussels sprouts, look for bright green sprouts with firmly packed leaves that aren’t yellow or withering. Avoid sprouts that are cracked or have too many black spots.",
      "**Bacon:** both regular and thick cut bacon work.",
      "**Pecans:** use raw, unsalted pecans. Coarsely chop them, or buy “pecan pieces”. If you don’t like pecans, walnuts are a nice substitute.",
      "**Ground (Dry) Mustard:** dry mustard is just ground up mustard seeds. On its own, it’s essentially flavorless, but once it’s “activated” by a liquid (in this recipe, bourbon) it bring a pleasant pungency and a bit of acidity to the dish.",
      "**Bourbon:** bourbon is used to deglaze the pan, and lends a smoky flavor. But more importantly, bourbon is slightly acidic! This is important, as the acidity will neutralize the sulfuric odors released during the cooking process (those orders, and resulting flavor, are why some find Brussels sprouts so off-putting. Neutralize it for clean, rich flavor!).",
      "**Maple Syrup:** our sweet foil! Opposites attract, and here we have a few. Maple syrup will balance out the saltiness in the bacon, the pungency of the mustard, and the acidity of the bourbon. It’s a must, so don’t skip!",
      "Use **real maple syrup**, not pancake syrup, for pure maple flavor.",
      "**Swap pecans for walnuts**, or simply omit them.",
      "**Don’t overcook the Brussels sprouts when blanching!** Drain them when they’re still bright green, after 4-5 minutes.",
      "Season the water with **plenty of kosher salt** – about a tablespoon; it will infuse the Brussels sprouts with flavor from the inside out.",
      "Use a **large, 12″ skillet.** This allows the Brussels sprouts to make lots of contact with the surface for crispier edges.",

Add the brussels sprouts to the boil water and give them a good stir. Boil 4-5 minutes, until the sprouts are tender but still bright green in color. Drain in a colander, run under cold water to stop the cooking process, then lay on a kitchen towel to dry.",
      "Place the bacon in a 12\" skillet and heat over medium heat. Saute, stirring occassionally, until the fat renders and bacon is crisp, 7-8 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and place onto a paper-towel lined plate to drain.",
      "Increase the heat to medium high, then add the blanched Brussels sprouts and pecans to the rendered bacon fat. Saute over high heat, stirring frequently, until the sprouts are crisp, 4-5 minutes.",
      "Sprinkle the mustard powder over the sprouts and pecans, then stir constantly for 1 minute. Pour the bourbon (or cider vinegar) into the pan to deglaze; stir and scrape constantly until any browned bits have been scraped up and the bourbon is completely absorbed, 2-3 minutes.",
      "Add the bacon back to the pan, then pour in the maple syrup. Give everything a good toss, then cook 1 minute more, until the syrup is slightly thickened. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper if needed. Serve right away, and enjoy!"

You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.",
      "Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.",
      "To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.",

      "Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.",
      "Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.",

      "Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side, or until chicken is no longer pink. Transfer to a clean plate.",
      "Once slightly cooled shred chicken into smaller pieces. Transfer to the saute pan that has 2 cups of tomatillo sauce. Turn heat to medium and warm chicken and sauce until hot. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons yogurt. Taste season with more salt and pepper as desired.",
      "Assemble bowls with quinoa, add tomatillo chicken and other desired toppings.",
      "**Additional Topping Suggestions**: Sliced limes, radishes, cilantro, diced onion, tomatoes, black beans, sour cream, and avocado."

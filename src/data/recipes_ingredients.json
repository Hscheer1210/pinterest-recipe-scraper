      "I love making salads that include protein. This shrimp avocado salad is **healthy, filling, satisfying, and light**. It's a well-balanced meal that combines veggies (avocado and arugula), protein (shrimp), a small amount of your favorite fruit (I used mango), and nuts (I used pine nuts). It's **super-versatile and flexible**, and you can use a wide variety of ingredients and substitutions (see more on that below the recipe card). I've made it so many times this Summer because it definitely became one of my family's most requested salads! This recipe is a great way to dress up and give so much flavor to **the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp**. Or cook raw shrimp from scratch using one of my recipes: [shrimp scampi with capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/) or [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)",
      "This light and refreshing salad takes under 20 minutes to make, which is great for busy weeknights. You only need **6 main ingredients** - shrimp, avocado, spinach, mango, pine nuts, and red onions.  The salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). Shrimp avocado salad also makes a stunning presentation - perfect for sharing with the crowd! **Bring this Summer salad to picnics, potlucks, barbecue parties, and other outdoor Summer festivities.** Or, serve it indoors for those special occasions when you want to impress your guests without spending too much time in the kitchen.",
      "*   **Packed with nutrients.** Shrimp avocado salad combines so many good-for-you ingredients. It's highly nutritious, packed with fiber and protein, and low in calories. It's gluten-free and dairy-free. It's also pescatarian - perfect for vegetarians who incorporate seafood into their diets.  It will make a delicious healthy addition to the list of your family's favorites.",

      "One of the best things about this sweet potato and cauliflower tacos recipe is that it creates _tons_ of flavor using just a few **budget-friendly ingredients**, most of which are probably already in your kitchen! Flavor-packed dinners def don’t have to be complicated or pricey!",
      "If you’re new to the world of plant-based cooking, cashews are an awesome solution to creating irresistibly creamy vegan sauces like [cashew crema](https://playswellwithbutter.com/cashew-crema/). Nuts feature tons of healthy fats, which are great for making things creamy. When blended with a liquid like water, the rich fats in cashews transform into a beautifully thick, smooth sauce. As a bonus, cashews also have a pretty neutral taste, making them the perfect vehicle for other flavorful ingredients.",
      "1.  **Prep:** Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F, ensuring a rack is positioned in the center of the oven. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil for easy clean-up as desired. Gather and prep all ingredients according to Ingredients List, above (e.g. break down the cauliflower, dice the sweet potato, measure the spices, etc.).![Cauliflower florets, sweet potato, olive oil, chili powder, ground cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, dried oregano, black beans, roasted unsalted cashews, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, garlic, and lime arranged on a light peach colored surface and a wooden cutting board.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-2-595x397.jpg)",
      "4.  **Prepare the cashew crema and other taco fixings:** Meanwhile, as the veggies roast, prepare the cashew crema. Combine all listed ingredients in a high-speed blender. Blend until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender canister as needed. Transfer to a bowl and set aside, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. (At my house, we like to enjoy these tacos with a simple smashed avocado (avocado + lime + salt) and charred tortillas (more notes on this in the Recipe Notes, below) – this is a great time to prepare both of these components as well.)"

      "This little recipe isn’t complicated, doesn’t pretend to be something else. It has always been there in times when my grandmother knew she had to feed us cousins something we would actually eat after school. Using what she had in her pantry she created this easy meat sauce, but her hand was heavy and she often overseasoned. The large amount of pepper is what we as kids came to love and crave, even though we are now spread out around the world and it’s 20 years later. I’ve had many requests for the recipe, but struggled to share something I knew that Italian nonna’s might critcize for not being authentic. It is just a basic recipe that my South African grandma made from her heart, so please adjust whatever you like to your taste. The cloves aren’t really optional because it gives this dish that signature South African flavor (clove, mace, cinnamon and nutmeg are hugely popular ingredients in savory meat dishes!), just be sure to scoop it out before serving :) I can’t tell you how many times she forgot, and had one of us very shocked after biting into one. If you prefer some spice, add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and some hot smoked paprika. If you follow a vegetarian diet, I recommend trying plant based protein like Beyond products or soy mince. Burrata is entirely optional, you could either leave it out or use a nice shaving of Parmesan cheese."

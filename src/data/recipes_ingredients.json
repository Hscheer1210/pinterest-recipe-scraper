      "**Matcha** - I always, always suggest using ceremonial grade matcha powder in _drinks_. You _can_ use culinary grade matcha powder but it is less concentrated and the flavour and colour is completely different. Ceremonial grade matcha is deep, vivid green in colour and much more aromatic and naturally fresher and sweeter in taste.",
      "**Milk** - You can use dairy milk, plant-based milks, or nut milks. My personal preference is oat milk because it's slightly thicker and slightly naturally sweet which makes a creamy latte and the flavour goes so well with matcha.",
      "**Sweetener** - Liquid sweeteners like agave nectar, honey, and simple syrup work best with matcha because they mix together easily. You can definitely also use granulated sugar but just make sure it dissolves thoroughly. Adjust the sweetness level to your tastes.",
      "**Strawberries** - You can use fresh or frozen strawberries - both work perfectly. If using frozen, let them thaw in the fridge overnight or at room temperature for 30 mins to 1 hour before blending.",
      "**Heavy cream** - The heavy cream in the strawberry sweet cream really makes a difference in the consistency of the cream. The addition of the extra bit of regular milk prevents it from turning into whipped cream when blended. For a plant-based alternative, you can use canned coconut milk or regular plant-based milk and froth it well in the blender.",

      "**Healthy breakfast**. This smoothie makes a great light and healthy breakfast with 6 grams of fibre and 5 grams of protein per serving.",
      "**Energizing**. The matcha in the smoothie will give you a steady caffeine boost and will make you feel energized to take on the day.",
      "**Quick and easy**. This recipe comes together in just 5 minutes and can be modified with any of your favourite fruits.",
      "**Frozen bananas**: It’s best to use frozen bananas as opposed to fresh bananas in this recipe. Frozen bananas will give the smoothie a thick and creamy texture. To freeze your bananas, simply wait until they are your preferred ripeness, then peel them, cut them into pieces and place them in a freezer bag in the freezer overnight.",
      "**Mango**: The mango in this recipe can be used fresh since the bananas are already frozen. Mango gives a tropical sweetness to the smoothie. If you prefer pineapple, you could use that too.",
      "**Spinach:** An optional ingredient, but gives the smoothie some added “hidden” veggies and an extra nutritional boost!",
      "**Matcha powder:** The star ingredient! Matcha is high in antioxidants and is perfect to enjoy in the morning. If you find the taste of matcha quite strong, start with just 1-2 tsp of matcha powder. If you prefer a stronger tasting matcha smoothie, simply add another 1-2 tsp.",
      "**Hemp seeds:** One tablespoon of hemp seeds has approx. 4 grams of protein! The hemp seeds blend up nicely into the smoothie and don’t add any taste, but they are great for adding protein and fibre to this smoothie!",
      "**Almond milk**: You can use any type of milk you like in this recipe.",
      "**Sweetener of choice:** Another optional ingredient. If your fruit isn’t quite sweet enough, you may want to add a touch of maple syrup or agave to the smoothie. If you’re using sweet bananas and mangos, you probably won’t need any additional sweetener.",
      "**Use a good quality matcha powder**. The matcha should have a rich green colour. This will make a big difference in both the taste and the benefits the matcha will have.",
      "**Use some frozen fruit**. If you use all fresh fruit, the smoothie won’t become thick and creamy. It’s best to use at least half if not all frozen fruit.",
      "**Cut your bananas into pieces** before freezing them. This will make the bananas easier to blend up.",
      "Depending on the size of your fruit and your preferred smoothie texture, you may need more or less almond milk in the recipe. Start with less and add more as you blend if needed.",

This shrimp avocado salad is **healthy, filling, satisfying, and light**. It's a well-balanced meal that combines veggies (avocado and arugula), protein (shrimp), a small amount of your favorite fruit (I used mango), and nuts (I used pine nuts). It's **super-versatile and flexible**, and you can use a wide variety of ingredients and substitutions (see more on that below the recipe card). I've made it so many times this Summer because it definitely became one of my family's most requested salads! This recipe is a great way to dress up and give so much flavor to **the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp**. Or cook raw shrimp from scratch using one of my recipes: [shrimp scampi with capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/) or [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n\nCrowd-pleasing Summer salad\n---------------------------\n\nThis light and refreshing salad takes under 20 minutes to make, which is great for busy weeknights. You only need **6 main ingredients** - shrimp, avocado, spinach, mango, pine nuts, and red onions.  The salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). Shrimp avocado salad also makes a stunning presentation - perfect for sharing with the crowd! **Bring this Summer salad to picnics, potlucks, barbecue parties, and other outdoor Summer festivities.** Or, serve it indoors for those special occasions when you want to impress your guests without spending too much time in the kitchen.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-1-1.jpg \"Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.\")\n\nIs it a healthy salad?\n----------------------\n\n*   **Packed with nutrients.** Shrimp avocado salad combines so many good-for-you ingredients. It's highly nutritious, packed with fiber and protein, and low in calories. It's gluten-free and dairy-free. It's also pescatarian - perfect for vegetarians who incorporate seafood into their diets.  It will make a delicious healthy addition to the list of your family's favorites.\n*   **Shrimp** is naturally low in carbs and rich in protein. It's low-fat but the fat that it does provide is a good kind of fat (beneficial omega-3 fatty acids).\n*   **Avocado** is packed with healthy fats and is a great source of vitamins B6, C,  E, and K. It also provides folate, magnesium, potassium, and copper.\n*   **Mango** is an excellent source of vitamin C.\n*   **Arugula** is rich in Vitamins A, C, and K, and is a great source of calcium, potassium, and folate.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-recipe-1-1-300x300.jpg)\n\nShrimp Avocado Salad is a quick and easy **Mediterranean-style recipe** that makes a great side salad, lunch, or light dinner.

You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.\n*   **Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.\n*   **Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad. I recommend mango, peaches, nectarines, and apricots. You can also add citrus fruit which will pair well with shrimp, such as oranges, mandarine oranges, or grapefruit.\n*   **Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice.\n\nTips for Success\n----------------\n\n*   **Use pre-cooked shrimp.** It saves so much time, and this avocado salad is just a great way to dress up the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp.\n*   **Any size of shrimp works.** I do prefer to use large, but this is a great recipe to use up smaller cooked shrimp!\n*   **Cook shrimp from scratch.** If you have raw shrimp, simply cook it on the stovetop. Here is a nice, light recipe for [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/).\n*   **Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!\n*   **Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.\n\nHow to tell if an avocado is ripe?\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.\n*   **An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.\n\nMake-ahead tips\n---------------\n\n*   If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.\n*   Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.\n\nMore shrimp recipes\n-------------------\n\n*   [Garlic Butter Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/garlic-butter-shrimp/)\n*   [Shrimp Scampi with Capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n*   [Honey-Mustard Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/honey-mustard-garlic-shrimp/)\n*   [Lemon Shrimp Orzo](https://juliasalbum.com/lemon-shrimp-orzo-asparagus/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime and Black Bean Rice Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-black-bean-shrimp-and-rice/)\n\nOther healthy salads you might like\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   [Apple Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/apple-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Holiday Salad with Spinach, Mandarin Oranges, Pecans, Cranberries, Goat Cheese, and Honey-Mustard Lime Vinaigrette](https://juliasalbum.com/holiday-salad/)\n*   [Peach Blueberry Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/peach-blueberry-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Berry Spinach Salad with Blueberries, Raspberries, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/berry-spinach-salad-with-blueberries-raspberries/)\n*   [Strawberry Spinach Salad with Feta cheese, Pecans, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/strawberry-spinach-salad-recipe/)\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

It’s tossed in a delicious citrus vinaigrette, and is the perfect way to eat more veggies!\n\n![arugula salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1A75F2BE-F73B-4B84-B7DA-4EA275C10086-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**Arugula Citrus Salad**\n------------------------\n\nNow that the weather is starting to get warmer, I’m all about light and fresh salads during the week. This arugula citrus salad is filled with so many feel-good ingredients, and is the perfect lunch to serve as is or with a grilled piece of protein.\n\nIt’s filled with crunchy toasted almonds, fresh orange slices, tricolor quinoa, and hearty chickpeas. The salad is tossed in a homemade citrus vinaigrette, and is seriously the perfect spring salad!\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13FE18F3-23DF-477F-AE22-ECF1609DE7BC-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThere are so many ways to prepare delicious hearty salads, but sometimes they can get repetitive. Here are a few tips to make the best salads at home:\n\n1.  Add a grain- grains add such a hearty component to salads, and can take them from a side dish to a main meal\n2.  Add a crunch- you’ll rarely ever see me eating a salad without some form of nuts or seeds added. They add such a delicious crunch and help give texture to your salads. Toasting the nuts is an extra step, but adds the most rich flavor!\n3.  Add canned beans- canned beans are an affordable way to add more flavor, fiber and protein to your salads. My go-to’s are usually chickpeas and cannellini beans since they’re subtle tasting and work well with so many flavors\n4.  Finish it off with cheese! Whether you use dairy or vegan cheese, the saltiness provides delicious depth of flavor and adds a little more heartiness to your salad\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/683056D7-F6A4-4A70-8124-07DE41DDBAD0-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What you’ll need to make this arugula citrus salad:**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Arugula- the arugula keeps this salad light and fresh. It’s the perfect base for this citrus salad\n*   Quinoa- I love adding quinoa to this salad, but other grains that would also work well are farro, barley, or pearled couscous\n*   Avocado- a slightly firm avocado is ideal for any salad since it will keep its shape and still have flavor\n*   Oranges- for added freshness and sweetness\n*   Chickpeas- for a boost of fiber and protein\n*   Crumbled cheese- feta is my go-to for salads, but feel free to swap any cheese of choice\n*   Homemade citrus vinaigrette\n\n![](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06007365-5420-479E-BCE8-C39099F47B57-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThe sweet, salty and savory flavors in this salad work so well together. It’s delicious on its own as a light lunch, but I love serving it with a grilled piece of salmon for an added boost of protein.\n\nThis salad is so simple to make, easily customizable, and is the perfect way to eat more salads this season!\n\n![arugula salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/F6E723C9-4EC3-421E-AFFE-633FC3A3AACD-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What to serve with your arugula citrus salmon:**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Honey Jalapeno Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-jalapeno-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pasta with Roasted Asparagus](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pasta-with-roasted-asparagus/)\n\n### [Honey Za’atar Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-zaatar-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pepper Tofu](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pepper-tofu/)\n\nArugula Citrus Salad\n--------------------\n\nCourse: Main\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1/2 cup 1/2 uncooked quinoa\n    \n*   1 cup 1 vegetable broth or water\n    \n*   5 oz 5 arugula, about 5-6 cups\n    \n*   1 can 1 chickpeas, drained (15 oz)\n    \n*   2 medium 2 avocados, slightly firm is ideal- cut into cubes\n    \n*   1 1 orange, peeled and chopped\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 slivered almonds\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 crumbled feta cheese\n    \n*   **Citrus Vinaigrette**\n*   1/4 cup 1/4 olive oil\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 orange juice\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 lemon juice\n    \n*   1 clove 1 garlic, crushed\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 dijon mustard\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 pure maple syrup\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 chopped red onion or shallots\n    \n*   Salt & pepper\n    \n\n### Directions\n\n*   Add the quinoa and vegetable broth to a sauce pan and bring it to a boil.

Remove the pot from the heat and it let sit for 10 minutes while you prepare your salad ingredients. After 10 minutes, fluff with a fork and season with a little salt.\n*   While the quinoa cooks, add you slivered almonds to a sheet pan and set them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes to toast. Alternatively, you can toast them in a small pan over a medium flame until they start to brown.\n*   Prepare your salad dressing by combining all of the ingredients together.\n*   Add your arugula to a large salad bowl and toss it together with half of the dressing.\n*   Add the quinoa, chickpeas, oranges, avocado, toasted almonds and cheese and top it with the remaining dressing.\n*   Toss to combine and enjoy!\n\n### Did you make this recipe?\n\nTag @somethingnutritious on Instagram- I’d love to see your creations!"

In fact, I didn’t tell anyone I made these because I am selfish like that.\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903_121134-2.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nIf you have never had Delicata Squash, boy oh boy, you are in for a treat, and I highly suggest you get your bottom down to the grocery store right now and grab a couple (or 10).  It’s lighter in flavor than any of the other squashes around.  I don’t know about you guys with kids, but squash is pretty much the only thing that my kids don’t like eating.  Well not delicata.   It is the first thing off their plates.\n\nMy favorite thing about this squash though has to be the fact that you don’t have to peel it.  Yup, that’s right!  You can eat the skin of these bad boys!  Well technically you can eat the skin of any winter squash, but it probably won’t be that tasty.  Don’t worry though, this skin is delicious!\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Roasted-Delicata-Squash.png?resize=640%2C960&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nWhat I love about delicata squash is that you can put ANY seasonings you feel like sprinkling on there and it will be out of this world good.  Here are a few of my favorite seasoning blends for it….\n\n1.  [PRIMAL PALATE](https://www.primalpalate.com/organic-spices/ref/88/) French Onion blend.\n2.  My ranch blend from [HERE](https://pretenditsadonut.com/2018/01/16/sheet-pan-ranch-pork-loin/)\n3.  Salt and dried thyme.\n\nBut my favorite spice blend has to be the one you are about to read in the recipe.  Finger-lickin-wish I had doubled the batch-good.\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903_121141-2.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nThese are definitely best eaten right away while they are still warm.  They aren’t terrible cold, but your mouth will be much happier with them straight outta the oven.  I sometimes save some to put in my kids lunches, because I don’t really care if they eat it cold!  And they don’t mind either.  At least I don’t think they mind.  They’ve never complained. So that’s a plus!\n\nROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\n\nIngredients\n\n*   2 medium Delicata Squash, sliced 1/8 of an inch thick\n*   2 tbl avocado oil\n*   squeeze of lime\n*   Fresh cilantro for garnish\n\nSPICE BLEND:\n\n*   1 tbl paprika\n*   1 1/2 tsp chipotle powder\n*   1 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n*   1 tsp cumin\n*   1 tsp sea salt\n\nCHIPOTLE AIOLI:\n\n*   1/4 cup mayonnaise\n*   1 tsp spice blend\n*   1 tsp lime juice\n\nInstructions\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls - Ev's Eats\n[Jump to Recipe](#mv-creation-94-jtr)\n\nA little magic went down in the kitchen earlier today, and they involve these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls.\n\nCilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin. If that’s not enough, the bowls are then topped with [mango salsa](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/) and some sweet fried plantains on the side, perfection.\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-2.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)\n\nThis recipe is special for me as it is near and dear to my heart. One of the reasons I fell in love with cooking was because I always had strong, positive female role models who always took such care and pride in preparing meals for their loved ones. From my grandma, to my mom, down to my aunties they showed me how to put love in food, and how it was the most important ingredient. Recently I lost one of my aunties, and I want to dedicate this post and recipe to her.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of my Aunt was her preparing breakfast for my Uncle and all of her nieces and nephews. She used to make the best sausages, and her kitchen was never dull as she would dance and sing all while cooking. We used to laugh as kids because food used to fly around the kitchen whenever she was in there, and man her food was ALWAYS amazing!\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-9.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nIt’s been tough dealing with losing her, but I take comfort in knowing that she’s always with me especially when I’m in the kitchen. In my culture, we celebrate life and not death. So to celebrate her life and the love of the journey that life takes us all on, I decided to get in the kitchen and whip up these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls (something I know she would’ve loved) and pour a glass of [Wente Vineyard’s Riva Ranch Chardonnay](https://ooh.li/83923f3) as a toast to her and all the lives she touched.\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-5.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nThese bowls are full of life, flavor, and spice just like my aunty. Let me break down the components of yumminess for you!\n\n1.  Cuban Style Chicken- I marinated this chicken in such amazing spices! Cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, chili powder, fresh garlic, lime juice and zest, and orange juice and zest! This chicken is perfect with pretty much anything. In a salad, tacos, sandwiches, etc!  Very similar to my [Mojo Cuban Pork](https://evseats.com/cuban-sandwiches/) recipe, how can you pass up on delicious moist and juicy chicken?!\n2.  Cuban Style Black Beans- Oh! These may just be my favorite part! More amazing flavors of cumin and smoked paprika. I mash half of the beans and mix it all together to keep some texture, and it’s just delicious! I’ve been known to just eat a whole pan of these, lol!\n3.  Cilantro Lime Rice- Okay by now we all know how much I love rice, but this rice is next level!

To a blender, combine the ingredients for the chicken marinade.

Blend together until everything is finely chopped and smooth.\n2.  Add the chicken to a bowl or a Ziploc bag and pour half the marinade over the chicken. Toss to coat and allow the chicken to sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the marinade.\n3.  Heat a large skillet with vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

Cook for about 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has absorbed.\n2.  Turn off the heat and allow rice to sit with the lid on for an additional 5 minutes. Add the lime, cilantro and season with salt and pepper, to taste.\n3.  To serve, divide the cilantro lime rice among bowls. Top with chicken and black beans. Add mango salsa and fried plantains if desired!\n\n###### Nutrition Information:\n\nYield: 4 Serving Size: 1  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 829Total Fat: 22gSaturated Fat: 3gTrans Fat: 0gUnsaturated Fat: 17gCholesterol: 71mgSodium: 1633mgCarbohydrates: 112gFiber: 23gSugar: 21gProtein: 49g\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-pin-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1)\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-Pin.jpg?resize=512%2C1024&ssl=1)"

I promise it’s super easy and takes just a few steps! Check out my answers to some common questions below:\n\n**How do you cut up zucchini?**\n\nI recommend cutting zucchini lengthwise into long strips. Remove the ends off the zucchini and cut into 1/3-inch or 1/2-inch slices.\n\nDepending on the size of your zucchini, you’ll end up with 3-4 strips per vegetable.\n\n**Should you salt zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYes! I definitely recommend salting the cut up strips of zucchini prior to grilling them. Simply sprinkle them with salt, then let them sit for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe salt will pull out a lot of the water in the zucchini, which you can pat off before putting them on the grill. This will help prevent a watery mess!\n\n**Do you peel zucchini before grilling?**\n\nNever :). I always suggest to leave the zucchini skins on. The skins of fruits + veggies often contain a TON of the nutrients and fibre. You don’t want to miss out on it!\n\n**Should you oil zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYup! I recommend brushing both sides of each zucchini slice with a little bit of olive or [avocado oil](https://www.walderwellness.com/recommends/avocado-oil/) before placing them on the grill. This helps to prevent the zucchini from drying out and sticking to the grill.\n\n![overhead shot of wood cutting board with zucchini, honey, goat cheese, and basil](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-1-683x1024.jpg)\n\nIs Grilled Zucchini Healthy?\n----------------------------\n\nYou bet! Zucchini is not only delicious, but it’s jam-packed with nutrition benefits, too.\n\nZucchini is rich in many **micronutrients**, like:\n\n*   **vitamin A**\n*   **vitamin C**\n*   **vitamin K**\n*   **vitamin** **B6**\n*   **folate**\n*   **manganese**\n*   **magnesium**\n*   **potassium**\n*   **copper**\n\nThis summer squash is also a great source of **dietary fibre**, with one medium zucchini providing 2 grams or 8% of your daily fibre needs.\n\nLike other fruits and veggies, zucchini is also a great source of **antioxidants**, especially carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin.\n\n![light blue plate with grilled zucchini slices topped with crumbled goat cheese, basil and honey](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-2-683x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat To Pair With Grilled Zucchini\n----------------------------------\n\nNeed some ideas to make this grilled zucchini a full meal?

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

However, you could also use chicken thighs, but cooking times may vary. When cubing the chicken, try to get them as close in size as possible for even cooking.\n\n**Seasonings:** To season the chicken, you will need paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and pepper.\n\n**[Mayonnaise](https://iamhomesteader.com/homemade-mayonnaise/):** The mayonnaise gives the sauce the creamy texture and richness that bang bang sauce is known for.

If possible, make your own!\n\n**Sriracha:** Sriracha gives the sauce a spicy kick with some heat. You can definitely add more (or use less), depending on how much heat you can handle!\n\n**Honey:** Honey is used to balance out the flavors of the sauce. It adds a natural sweetness that helps to counteract the heat from the Sriracha and balances the tanginess of the Thai sweet chili sauce.\n\n![Raw Bang Bang Chicken Skewers Before Cooking.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-3.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer. They make for a delicious appetizer or main course and can also be made in the oven!\")\n\nBoth wooden and metal skewers can be used when making these bang bang chicken skewers, even in the air fryer. If using wooden skewers, be sure they are soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before using them. Soaking them in water prevents the skewers from charring during cooking. If using metal skewers, make sure they fit in the basket of your air fryer. If using wooden skewers, you can break them in half if you need to shorten them.\n\n![Hand Holding One Bang Bang Chicken Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bangchicken.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer.

You can get the seasoned chicken skewers assembled ahead of time as well as make the bang bang sauce in advance. Once you have the chicken on the skewers, you can store them in the refrigerator or freeze them before cooking. If stored in the refrigerator, they will last 2-3 days, covered. These can also be frozen ahead of time. To freeze, tightly wrap the chicken skewers; they will last in the freezer for up to 3 months. When ready to cook them, let the skewers thaw in the refrigerator overnight. The bang bang sauce can be mixed together and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\n\n![Bang Bang Chicken Skewers on Parchment with a Few Pieces of Chicken not on the Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-6.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer. They make for a delicious appetizer or main course and can also be made in the oven!\")\n\nStoring & Reheating Bang Bang Chicken Skewers\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any leftover chicken skewers, store the skewers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. (If preferred, you can remove the chicken from the skewers when storing.) Reheat them in the oven, microwave, or in a skillet on the stovetop. Store the leftover reserved bang bang sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Brush it over the reheated chicken.\n\n*   ▢ wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes\n\n#### Chicken\n\n*   ▢ 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon black pepper\n\n*   In a large bowl, combine the cubed chicken breasts, oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to evenly coat the chicken.\n    \n*   Working one skewer at a time, thread 4-5 chicken cubes onto each.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce, Sriracha, and honey. Mix well. This will make about 1 ¾ cups bang bang sauce.\n    \n*   Pour half of the sauce into a separate bowl and set aside to use after the chicken has been cooked. Use the rest of the sauce to brush evenly over the chicken.\n    \n*   Add the skewers to the basket of your air fryer in a single layer. (Depending on the size of the air fryer, you may have to work in batches.)\n    \n*   Air fry\\* at 400°F for 11-12 minutes, flipping halfway. Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n    \n*   Transfer the skewers to a plate and drizzle or brush with the reserved bang bang sauce. Serve immediately.\n    \n\n**\\*Oven and Grilling Instructions:**\n\n**Oven:**\n\n1.  Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2.  Place the seasoned cubes of chicken onto the skewers, then onto the lined baking sheet. (Do not brush the chicken with bang bang sauce until after baking in the oven.)\n3.  Cook the chicken skewers for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n4.  Remove from the oven. Brush with the bang bang sauce and serve.\n\n**Grill:**\n\n1.  Thread the seasoned chicken onto the skewers. (Wait until after grilling to brush with the bang bang sauce.) Grill over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes per side, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n2.  Brush the grilled chicken with the bang bang sauce.\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n\nYou can tag me at @iamhomesteader.\n\nWhat the **Test Kitchen** had to say about this recipe:\n\n![](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8710-343x343.jpg)\n\nAutumn\n\nIf you are looking for a simple dish that packs some serious flavor, this one is for you.

Read our [disclaimer.](https://thealmondeater.com/contact/privacy-policy/)_ \n\n_This Autumn Harvest Bowl is warm, comforting and filled with healthy ingredients. The base is made with arugula and it's topped with quinoa, sweet potatoes and goat cheese, along with a delicious maple-tahini dressing for tons of flavor!_ \n\n![A bowl of food with Quinoa and Salad](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-1-3.jpg.webp)\n\nBowl food is the best food, and this autumn harvest bowl is perfect this time of year!\n\n \n\nOne of the many reasons why I like bowls like this (and my [vegan burrito bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/vegan-burrito-bowl/ \"Vegan Burrito Bowl\") and my [Mediterranean quinoa bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/mediterranean-quinoa-bowl/ \"Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl\")) is because they're quick and generally filled with healthy ingredients. This bowl in particular is topped with all of the best foods like sweet potato, apple, goat cheese, and the most delicious maple-tahini sauce.\n\nI still remember the first time I tried tahini. Everyone was so obsessed with it, so I had high hopes that I would be too. To be honest, plain tahini doesn't thrill me, but tahini mixed with other things IS SO GOOD. It's a great nut-free dressing or sauce option, and pairs well with so many flavors (in this case, maple syrup!).\n\nWhy you'll love this bowl\n-------------------------\n\n*   It's loaded with vegetables like arugula and sweet potato, but has plenty of protein thanks to the quinoa and chickpeas\n*   The maple tahini sauce is INSANELY good\n*   It can be enjoyed warm or cold (yes really!)\n*   It's quite similar to the harvest bowl from [Sweet Green](https://www.sweetgreen.com/), so think of this as making your own homemade version.\n\n![A bowl filled with different types of food on a plate](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-ingredients.png.webp)\n\nIngredients and substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\n**Arugula:** The base of this bowl should be some sort of greens, and I chose arugula, but other options could be spinach or massaged kale.\n\n**Quinoa:** The quinoa adds a bit of protein to this, but again, any grain works! Rice, farro, barley, etc. would all be delicious.\n\n**Sweet potatoes:** You could also used cubed and cooked butternut squash.\n\n**Cranberries:** Who doesn't love cranberries? They add a little bit of sweetness and scream \"fall\", but you could also use raisins or chopped pitted dates.\n\n**Goat cheese:** Or sub feta cheese\n\nStep-by-step instructions\n-------------------------\n\n**Step 1: Cook the quinoa and sweet potatoes.** You can do this ahead of time if you want to make this even quicker.\n\n**Step 2: Add arugula.** Place arugula in a bowl, then top it with the cooked quinoa. Then, add the remaining salad ingredients.\n\n![A bowl of arugula and quinoa](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-11.png.webp)\n\n**Step 3: Make the dressing.** Whisk tahini and maple syrup together, then drizzle it over the salad.\n\nExpert tips\n-----------\n\n*   Don't love arugula? Try using mixed greens or even kale instead.\n\n*   Do NOT to slice the apple until you're ready to eat it.\n\n*   If you don't love maple syrup, you can use honey in the dressing instead.\n\n### What if I want to add meat to this?\n\nYou can! However, since the dressing is maple-tahini, I'm not sure how well that'd pair with most meat. If you do want to add meat, I'd go with chicken, and maybe just use a different dressing.\n\nStorage\n-------\n\nIf you're prepping this harvest bowl ahead of time, you'll want to store it in the refrigerator, but in separate containers.\n\nStore the arugula, chickpeas, cranberries, and goat cheese in one container and the cooked quinoa and sweet potato in another. That way, you can reheat the potatoes and quinoa if you want.\n\n![A bowl of salad with Quinoa and Feta](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-1-4.jpg.webp)\n\nMore healthy bowls\n------------------\n\n*   [Vegan Bibimbap](https://thealmondeater.com/vegan-bibimbap/ \"Vegan Bibimbap\")\n*   [Vegan Burrito Bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/vegan-burrito-bowl/ \"Vegan Burrito Bowl\")\n*   [Cauliflower Breakfast Bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/cauliflower-breakfast-bowl/ \"Cauliflower Breakfast Bowl\")\n*   [Sun-Dried Tomato Salad](https://thealmondeater.com/arugula-sun-dried-tomato-salad/ \"Sun-Dried Tomato Salad\")\n*   [Mediterranean Hummus Bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/mediterranean-hummus-bowl/ \"Mediterranean Hummus Bowl\")\n\n_**If you made this recipe, be sure to leave a comment and star rating below.

It’s a completely versatile and adaptable dough.\n\nThere are several types of bread that can fall into the flatbread category. Some of them have yeast and some don’t. I tend to like a little bit of yeast in my flatbread and pizza dough. Not so much that it puffs up a lot, just enough so that it’s more substantial.\n\nMake your own online recipe box!\n--------------------------------\n\n**Click the in the lower right corner of your screen  \n& follow the quick and easy instructions!**\n\n### FLATBREAD OPTIONS\n\nIf you’re not feeling up to making your own dough at home, you can certainly buy pre-made flatbread and still make a great-tasting dinner. I have often purchased flatbread at the grocer and topped it with sauce, cheese, and our favourite toppings. It’s a great way to whip up dinner in a hurry. And, it’s a lot cheaper than pizza delivery!\n\nThis recipe will work perfectly with focaccia, even though it’s a very thick type of flatbread. Naan works very well! Roti will work well too, especially if you’re looking for unleavened bread. (Unleavened is a term that applies to breads that do not include an ingredient such as yeast which makes the bread rise and proof. Most flat types of bread and unleavened breads.)\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

I had made up a double batch of the dough a little while ago and decided to make a **_[Traditional Newfoundland Pizza](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/homemade-newfoundland-pizza/)_** for myself and McKenna. I knew John.e wouldn’t eat it, because Newfie pizza is a far cry from being vegetarian.\n\nArmed with black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta, I decided to make a Mediterranean-style flatbread for him. If you’ve been a reader of this blog for any serious amount of time, you would have known that this flatbread wasn’t for me as soon as you looked at the photographs.\n\nI refuse to eat black olives, but John.e loves them. To date, there are over 500 recipes here at Lord Byron’s Kitchen, and this is only the second recipe that features black olives. My [**_Warm Farro Salad_**](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/warm-farro-salad/) has black olives in it too. I can’t make _all_ of the recipes for myself. I have to be nice and make a recipe or two with ingredients that I don’t really care for, right?\n\n### CHANGE IT UP; MAKE IT YOUR OWN!\n\nNow, just because this particular flatbread is modelled after common Mediterranean ingredients, that doesn’t mean you are stuck making your version the exact same way. You can add any toppings you like to your flatbread. You can even make one very large flatbread or two smaller ones like I made.\n\nMost kids are picky eaters, so you might want to change up the black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta. I’ve used this same technique described in the recipe card and added just cheese and pepperoni on many occasions. The recipe is very forgiving and completely adaptable.\n\nIf by chance you or your family cannot finish the flatbread – no worries! Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread can be saved and reheated later. Let the flatbread completely cool and then refrigerate. When ready to reheat, wrap loosely in aluminum foil and bake for 5-7 minutes in a 350-degree preheated oven.\n\nThe aluminum foil should not touch the top of the pizza but should cover it. This will prevent the toppings from burning, and will also prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil. If you freeze the leftovers, allow the flatbread to thaw completely at room temperature before attempting to reheat.\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

For exact amounts and measurements, refer to the printable recipe card located near the bottom of this post.\n\n#### FOR THE DOUGH:\n\n*   **_Active Dry Yeast_** – Do not confuse this with Instant Yeast. Active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water before using, while instant yeast can be mixed right into dry ingredients.\n*   **_Olive Oil_** – You can also use vegetable, canola, avocado oil, etc.\n*   **_Sugar_** – This might seem odd, but the sugar makes for a tastier dough, plus, it gives the yeast something to feed on which promotes proofing or rising.\n*   **_Flour_** – I only ever used all-purpose unbleached flour in my dough. I have not experimented with other flour options at this point.\n*   **_Warm Water_** – The water should be as close to 110 degrees F as possible. Too hot and you will kill the yeast; too cold and it won’t activate properly.\n*   **_Salt_**\n\n#### Lord Byron’s Notes\n\nActive Dry Yeast and Instant Yeast are essentially the same thing and both of them will give you the same result in the end. The difference is that active dry yeast works more slowly than instant yeast and is often used in recipes where water is mixed with the yeast to activate it before the dry ingredients are added to prepare the dough. In contrast, instant yeast works much faster and does not need to be activated by water. It is almost always mixed right into the dry ingredients.\n\n**Scroll down to the comment section and write me a message.**\n\n_I will personally respond as soon as possible!_\n\n#### FOR THE TOPPINGS:\n\nThese toppings are just suggestions. You can change it up and make a flatbread that suits your personal tastes.\n\n*   **_Mozzarella_** – Use fresh mozzarella and slice it about 1/4 inch thick.\n*   **_Sun Dried Tomatoes_** – Use the ones packed in oil. They have better flavour.\n*   **_Black Olives_** – I do not like olives at all, but I made this flatbread for John.e and he loves them. You can use green or none at all if that’s what pleases you.\n*   **_Feta_** – I love crumbled feta on flatbread, especially when it is a Mediterranean-inspired flatbread!\n*   **_Dried Herbs_** – Basil and oregano are perfect on this one!\n*   **_Parsley_** – Used for garnish and is optional.\n*   **_Egg_** – Beat with a little bit of water, this is used to brush the outside of the dough. It helps to brown the dough so that it looks better. You can skip this too if you wish.\n*   **_Non-stick Cooking Spray_**\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes! Simply change the toppings to suit your preferences! #flatbread #pizza #Mediterranean #homemade #recipe](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Homemade-Mediterranean-Flatbread-b-532x800.jpg)\n\n### HOW TO MAKE FLATBREAD:\n\n#### Let’s make the dough first!\n\nLet’s start with preparing the dough. If you have purchased dough from the grocer, follow the instructions on the package. Otherwise, make the dough from scratch by following these simple instructions.\n\nFill a mixing bowl with hot tap water. This will temper the bowl which is important to yeast activation and growth. Measure out 3/4 cup of water that’s 110 degrees F. Pour the water out of the bowl. Place one teaspoon of sugar into the bottom of the bowl and pour over the 3/4 cup of water. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water and let sit for two minutes.\n\nNext, whisk in the olive oil. Add the flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir the flour into the water and oil. Use your hand to knead the dough until it forms a smooth ball. Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside to rise. (Be sure to keep away from drafts or an open window.)\n\n![](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-800x533.jpg)\n\n#### Now, the fun part! Let’s assemble the flatbread!\n\nOnce the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F, and lightly spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Using only half of the dough per sheet pan, place the dough onto the pan and use a rolling pin to roll it out into an oblong or rectangular shape.\n\nNext, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough. Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n\nNext, top each pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta. Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano. Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if you are using it, and slice the flatbread into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes! Simply change the toppings to suit your preferences! #flatbread #pizza #Mediterranean #homemade #recipe](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6-1-533x800.jpg)\n\n### RECIPE TIPS & TRICKS\n\nThe key to a really good flatbread is the dough. You can use the dough recipe here and create any flavour of flatbread that you want. I have made this same dough and spread sun-dried tomato pesto on it with some mozzarella and pepperoni for a make-at-home pizza. I’ve also mixed together equal parts butter and parmesan cheese with a clove of minced garlic and a little splash of olive oil. Spread it over the dough and bake until bubbly. You now have easy garlic fingers! Be sure to dip them in my **_[Donair Sauce](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/newfoundland-donair-sauce/)_**!\n\nYou can also make the dough ahead of time. Once the dough has had time to rise, transfer it to a food-safe plastic bag. Get as much air out of the bag as possible and place the dough in the refrigerator. The dough will last in the fridge for 3-5 days. Once you’re ready to make your flatbread, remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out just like the recipe instructions indicate.\n\nIf you have any leftover flatbread, you can refrigerate it for 2-3 days and reheat it later. You can microwave it, but be sure to do so on half speed/power, otherwise, the crust gets a little chewy. You can also place the flatbread on a baking sheet and toss it in the oven. Set the oven to 200 degrees F and let it go for 5 minutes.\n\n### SERVING SUGGESTIONS\n\nIf you follow my Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread recipe exactly as written, you might want to continue the theme if you are looking to feed a larger group of people. I do this simply by adding side dishes that will complement the main. In the case of this flatbread, I would serve it with this **_[Greek Potato Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/greek-potato-salad/)_** or this **_[Cucumber Walnut Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/cucumber-walnut-salad/)_** or this **_[Fire Roasted Tomato and Artichoke Bean Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/fire-roasted-tomato-artichoke-bean-skillet/)_**!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

This will temper the bowl and help to ensure the yeast will properly activate. While you’re waiting for the bowl to warm, preheat the oven to 500 degrees – not broil, but degrees.\n    \n*   Pour the hot water out of the bowl and wipe the bowl dry. Add the warm tap water and the yeast. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the yeast into the water for no more than 5-10 seconds. Set aside and let the yeast bubble and foam for at least 3 minutes.\n    \n*   Sift together 2 cups of the flour, salt, and sugar.\n    \n*   Add the olive oil to the yeast and water mixture. Stir for a few seconds. Pour in the entire flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed.\n    \n*   Sprinkle your clean countertop with a little flour and empty the dough out. Knead the dough together for 4-5 minutes until a dough ball is formed. Place the dough back into the metal mixing bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and set the bowl on top of your preheating oven. (Don't place the bowl on a burner, just on the surface of the oven. The heat will help the dough to proof/rise.) Let the dough sit for five minutes.\n    \n\n#### For the Pizza:\n\n*   Lightly spray two small baking sheets or pizza pans with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.\n    \n*   When the dough is ready, lightly flour a flat surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a rectangular shape about the size of your pan.  Place the dough onto the baking sheet and push the dough into the corners and up to the sides. This does not need to be perfectly round or rectangular. Just be sure the dough is evenly flattened. (Repeat with the other half of the dough on a second baking sheet or pizza pan.)\n    \n*   Next, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough.\n    \n*   Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n    \n*   Next, top each pizza with the sun dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta.\n    \n*   Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano.\n    \n*   Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if using, and slice into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n    \n\nCalories: 662kcal | Carbohydrates: 63g | Protein: 30g | Fat: 33g | Saturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 135mg | Sodium: 1315mg | Potassium: 408mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 935IU | Vitamin C: 15.3mg | Calcium: 539mg | Iron: 4.9mg\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n-------------------------\n\nUpload a photo and tag me so that I can see it!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

(I mean is this not the tastiest problem to have? haha!)\n\nToday’s recipe was inspired by a surplus of arugula in my fridge.\n\nThis peppery leafy green was the \\*perfect\\* not-so-secret ingredient for this tasty Mediterranean pasta salad!\n\nI paired it with a fresh lemon dressing (lemon and arugula are a match made in heaven!) and a whole lot of veggies! A little feta here… a sprinkle of cracked black pepper there… and I am in LOVE!\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Lemon Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-2.jpg)\n\ncan I add extra veggies?\n------------------------\n\nYes! Yes! 1000x yes! This Mediterranean pasta salad would be the perfect base for all your favorite veggies.\n\nFeel free to raid you pantry for artichoke hearts or olives or empty your crisper drawer! You can add fresh basil, spinach, onion, bell pepper, and more.\n\nFor the noodles, I used bowtie (farfalle) pasta but there are a ton of varieties that work great here! You can use ditalini, orzo, elbow noodles, rotini, or even tortellini!\n\npasta salad dressing\n--------------------\n\nI’m a big fan of homemade salad dressing because 1. They’re CRAZY quick + easy to make and 2. I pretty much always have all the ingredients I need lying around.\n\nI paired this pretty pasta salad with a fresh [lemon dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2019/03/lemon-dressing.html) but there are a few others that would also work positively fantastic here. No fresh lemons on hand? Try it with my easy homemade [Greek Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/12/easy-homemade-greek-dressing-recipe.html) or [Italian Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2015/06/easy-homemade-italian-dressing.html), both of which pair oh so perfectly with pasta and veggies.\n\nMake a little… or a lot! This pasta salad yields 8-10 side dish sized servings.\n\nThe leftovers are oh so tasty (my husband and I are all about meal prepping cold pasta salad for the week) but if you’d like a smaller batch, feel free to halve it. Need to serve a crowd at a party or barbecue? Simply double or triple the recipe below and you’re good to go!\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Arugula and Feta](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-4-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 8 oz farfalle (bowtie) pasta\n*   ▢ 3 cups chopped fresh arugula\n*   ▢ 1/2-3/4 English cucumber\n*   ▢ 1 cup diced tomato\n*   ▢ 1 avocado\n*   ▢ ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP fresh chopped parsley (optional)\n\n#### LEMON DRESSING\\*\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2fyn7A)\n*   ▢ ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (via 1-2 large lemons)\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp lemon zest plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP plain dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 2 cloves garlic, freshly. minced\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp dried oregano leaves\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp salt\n*   ▢ ⅛ tsp black pepper\n\n*   First let's make the dressing! Zest 1 lemon and set aside. Juice your lemons to yield 1/4 cup of juice and add to a small/medium mason jar. Add lemon zest and remaining dressing ingredients and close lid tightly. Shake to emulsify the dressing.\n    \n*   Next cook pasta via package instructions. For farfalle you'll boil the pasta in water for approx. 12-14 minutes.\n    \n*   Chop arugula, cucumber, tomato and optional parsley and add to a large bowl. Save the avocado for just before serving.\n    \n*   Once your pasta is perfectly al dente, strain in a colander and run cold water to halt the cooking process and chill the pasta slightly. Then add the drained pasta to your veggies an toss together. \n    \n*   Shake once more if needed and add your dressing to the salad. Toss well to coat. Lastly add avocado and feta on top and gently fold into the salad. Add extra salt and pepper if desired and enjoy!\n    \n\n\\* If leftover dressing is desired (hello meal prep!) or if you're making this salad in advance, simply double the dressing recipe. When it chills in the fridge, the pasta soaks up much of the dressing. Simply refresh with an extra drizzle or so of dressing before serving, or let guests add extra to taste. Enjoy!\n\nNo bowtie pasta? No problem! Try it with ditalini, orzo, elbow, rotini, or even tortellini!\n\nSee post for a list of tasty extras and swaps.\n\n_Nutrition Facts below are estimated using an online recipe nutrition calculator. Adjust as needed based on extras added and enjoy!_\n\nCalories: 245kcal, Carbohydrates: 26g, Protein: 6g, Fat: 13g, Saturated Fat: 2g, Cholesterol: 8mg, Sodium: 229mg, Potassium: 320mg, Fiber: 3g, Sugar: 2g, Vitamin A: 390IU, Vitamin C: 11.4mg, Calcium: 84mg, Iron: 1.1mg\n\nNeed to make a vegan version? Simply skip the feta and this salad is gloriously vegan. The creamy feta cuts a bit of the acidity of the lemon dressing so if you find it super tart, feel free to add a tsp or so of sugar or maple syrup to the dressing to taste.\n\nIf you get a chance to try this quick and easy Mediterranean Pasta Salad, let me know! Leave some love in the comment form below or tag your photos with @peasandcrayons on Instagram so I can happy dance over your creation!

It's helped people lose weight, and in [one study](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y), it helped [reduce symptoms of depression](https://www.purewow.com/food/mood-boost-mediterranean-diet). Beyond that, the core ingredients of the diet also make for plenty of easy, nutritious snacks. So toss aside that bag of chips—here are 30 Mediterranean diet snacks (like [veggie sushi](https://www.purewow.com/recipes/Veggie-Sushi) and [pizza trail mix](https://www.purewow.com/recipes/pizza-trail-mix)) that are as satisfying, easy to make and portable as they are good for you.\n\nWhat Is the Mediterranean Diet?\n-------------------------------\n\nAs the name suggests, the [Mediterranean diet](https://www.purewow.com/food/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan) focuses on foods that are found in the Mediterranean (that includes palces like Greece, Italy and the Middle East). No food groups are off the table: You can eat everything from [chickpeas](https://www.purewow.com/food/recipes-to-make-with-chickpeas), quinoa, feta cheese, grapes, olive oil, Greek yogurt, [fish](https://www.purewow.com/food/easy-fish-recipes) and the like.\n\nWhat’s more, this diet is plant-focused but includes animal-sourced protein, seafood and dairy in small quantities, plus grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruits, veggies, olive oil and even wine in moderation, so it’s great for all people. Because it’s not restrictive, this is a diet with no risks, but it is particularly suited for those with heart disease, high blood pressure, depression and dementia, according to the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/mediterranean-diet/).\n\n30 Healthy Mediterranean Diet Snacks\n------------------------------------\n\n[](https://themodernproper.com/posts/grilled-flatbread-with-burrata-cheese)[![mediterranean diet snacks: grilled flatbread with burrata](https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/mediterreanean-diet-snacks-grilled-flatbread-with-burrata-recipe.jpg?fit=680%2C860)](https://themodernproper.com/posts/grilled-flatbread-with-burrata-cheese)\n\n1\\.

Takes less than 30 minutes to make_ _this soon-to-be your favorite white pizza!_\n\n![Whole mushroom spinach white pizza cut up in the baking sheet after baking in the oven](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-7-683x1024.jpg)\n\nAh, the football season is back!  \nAlthough I'm not a huge football fan, I love me some good game day food!\n\nThe essential criteria for a good game day food depend on how convenient the food is to eat while watching the game. Think about all the classic game day food - chicken wings, nachos, hot dogs, and sliders!\n\nThat's why pizza is perfect for a game day. You can hold pizza in one hand and drink on the other! Do you see what I'm saying?\n\n### What is White pizza and how it's different from Red pizza?\n\nRed pizza is a pizza made with tomato sauce. It's the most well-known and popular pizza. **White pizza**, also known as **pizza Bianca**, is any type of **pizza made without red tomato sauce**. In Italy, pizza Bianca is a pizza with mozzarella and/or parmesan cheese with a drizzle of olive oil and salt.\n\n*   ![Whole white pizza on the baking sheet, ricotta cheese spread and sautéed mushroom and spinach on top of the pizza](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole white pizza on the baking sheet before baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-2-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![whole white pizza after baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-3-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole mushroom spinach white pizza on the baking sheet after baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-4-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n\nConventional white pizza VS. my white pizza\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you search for white pizza recipes, you will come across many recipes with alfredo-like sauce for the pizza. The white pizza sauce is often made with butter, milk, parmesan cheese, and/or cream cheese. Mine **requires NO white sauce**. So what goes into my white pizza? Read on!\n\nIngredients in Mushroom Spinach White Pizza\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Pizza dough** - You can use store-bought dough. But I have [an easy pizza dough recipe (using a stand mixer)](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/fool-proof-easy-pizza-dough-recipe/) right here! Don't have a stand mixer? No problem! Check out my [pizza dough recipe by hand](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/easy-pizza-dough-recipe-without-a-stand-mixer-with-active-dry-yeast/) here.\n*   **Ricotta cheese** - this is an equivalent ingredient to a white sauce\n*   **Herbs** - I like to use Italian dried herbs with extra dried basil\n*   **Mushroom** - You can use any type of mushroom. I used button mushroom for this recipe. \n*   **Spinach** \\- I like to sauteed fresh baby spinach leaves.\n*   **Shredded mozzarella**  \n\n*   ![Whole white pizza with extra dollops of ricotta cheese on top, before baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-8-667x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole white pizza with extra dollops of ricotta cheese on top](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-9-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n\nHow to customize\n----------------\n\n*   You can always put **dollops of ricotta** on your pizza for extra creaminess\n*   **Experiment with other cheese** - People told me they added dollops of **goat cheese** for tanginess, **grated parmesan cheese**, and even **Mexican blend** shredded cheese\n*   **Other toppings** \\- Artichoke, tomato (sun-dried or slices), fresh basil, arugula, caramelized onions will all make great toppings\n*   **Elevate your pizza crust** by brush with garlic butter or stuff it with mozzarella or leftover ricotta cheese mixture\n\nHow to reheat the pizza\n-----------------------\n\nThere are several ways to reheat your pizza. \n\n1.  **Microwave** - it is the most convenient way to reheat the pizza but it will make your pizza very chewy, especially the crust part. \n2.  **On a stovetop** - You can reheat your pizza on **a skillet with a lid on top**. This will reheat your pizza nicely with your cheese all gooey and melty without changing the texture of the crust. \n3.  **Toaster oven/oven** - This is another convenient way but I like the toaster oven option (350F for 5-6 minutes) better since I don't have to preheat the oven. However, it takes a longer time to reheat. \n4.  **Air fryer** - This is my recently discovered way! You can place the pizza slices in the air fryer basket and cook between 320F to 330F for 2-4 minutes. It's a speedy and delicious way to reheat your leftover pizza.\n\n*   ![Two slices of white pizza on a white plate with the glass of rose in the background](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-18-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Two slices of white pizza with dollops of extra ricotta cheese on top.

Takes less than 30 minutes to make this deliciousness!\n\n*   **Prep Time:** 15 minutes\n*   **Cook Time:** 30 minutes\n*   **Total Time:** 45 minutes\n*   **Yield:** 2 large pizzas 1x\n*   **Category:** Main course\n*   **Method:** Bake\n*   **Cuisine:** Italian-Inspired\n*   **Diet:** Vegetarian\n\n*   1.5 lb of pizza dough of your choice (or half of either [this recipe (using a stand mixer](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/fool-proof-easy-pizza-dough-recipe/)) or this [pizza dough recipe by hand](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/easy-pizza-dough-recipe-without-a-stand-mixer-with-active-dry-yeast/)), divide in half\n    \n*   1 cup ricotta cheese, (plus 2\\-3 tablespoons, optional)\n*   ½ teaspoon salt\n*   ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning\n    \n*   ½ teaspoon dried basil\n    \n*   1 package button mushroom, sliced\n    \n*   1 teaspoon butter\n    \n*   ¼ teaspoon dried thyme\n    \n*   2-3 cups baby spinach leaves\n    \n*   1 teaspoon oil\n    \n*   ½ teaspoon garlic powder \n    \n*   ⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n    \n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n    \n*   ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)\n    \n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n1.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\n2.  On a medium-size non-stick skillet, add the sliced mushroom and cook on high heat for a couple of minutes. The water from the mushroom will start to extract and evaporate.\n3.  Once the water from the mushroom started to evaporate and the mushroom turns slightly brown, add the butter and dried thyme to the mushroom. Stir frequently and cook for an additional minute or two. Take them off the skillet and set them aside.\n4.  On the same skillet, add the oil and spinach leaves. Sprinkle garlic powder and pinch of salt to the spinach and cook until all the spinach leaves are wilted, about 3-5 minutes. \n5.  When the spinach is wilted, take it off from the heat and set it aside.\n6.  In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup of ricotta cheese, ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and ½ teaspoon of dried basil. \n7.  Divide the pizza dough in half.\n8.  Flour the working surface and start stretching the dough flat. Do the same for the other dough.\n9.  Spread the ricotta mixture to each of the stretched pizza dough evenly and thinly. \n10.  Add the cooked mushroom and spinach to both pizzas.\n11.  Add ⅓ cup of shredded mozzarella cheese (each) on top of the pizzas.\n12.  Sprinkle red pepper flakes if you like spicy pizza. If not, skip this step.\n13.  Sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top.\n14.  Place the pizzas in the oven and cook for 11-12 minutes. \n15.  Take them out of the oven and enjoy them right away.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   Red pepper flakes are totally optional. If you don't like spicy food, please skip this ingredient altogether. \n*   If you like creamy pizza, dollops of ricotta will totally give you that creaminess.\n*   Other great topping options are grated parmesan cheese and/or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. \n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

It’s got all the right flavors, textures, and the perfect creamy dressing to finish it all off. \n\nWe enjoy this salad as a side dish, but it can be made into a main course meal by adding in some protein. Grilled and chopped chicken, thinly sliced steak, or even some lentils or quinoa would add plenty of protein and make it filling enough for a full meal. In fact, one of our favorite ways to enjoy Blackberry Salad is with some shredded rotisserie chicken added in.\n\n ![Ingredients being added into a blender jar, processed until smooth, with poppy seeds mixed in, and the final dressing being poured.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad tips\n---------------------\n\n*   When serving Blackberry Salad for a party, event, or holiday meal, I recommend **making the candied pecans and dressing a day or two in advance**. This makes the final assembly a breeze! It’s also a good idea so the pecans have sufficient time to harden and the dressing has a chance to thoroughly chill and for the flavors to intensify.\n*   Use a **good mayonnaise for the dressing–** the better the mayo, the better the dressing will taste. I love Hellman’s/Best Foods® (not sponsored) since it has a rich flavor without being too sweet or tangy.\n*   If you aren’t able to find **fresh or ripe pears** at the store, use whole canned pears and drain them. Thinly slice and use in the salad.\n*   Speaking of ripe pears, you can **test a pear for ripeness** by applying gentle pressure near the stem end. If there is a slight give, it is most likely ready to be sliced and added to the salad. And if you can’t smell any sweet pear-ness, it probably isn’t ready to use.\n*   If you have a fresh lemon on hand, squeeze a bit of **lemon juice on the pear to keep it from browning too quickly**. [Here are a few more tips for preparing the pears](https://usapears.org/pear-ripening-and-handling/).\n\n ![Thin slices of pears and fresh blackberries prepared for a salad, with added feta cheese, leading to the salad's final assembly.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow to use leftover candied pecans\n----------------------------------\n\nSince it’s a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them.

They only need 10-15 minutes at room temperature to thaw enough to eat. (At room temperature, candied pecans last for up to 2 weeks stored in a cool and dry space.)\n\n ![Blackberry salad featuring a drizzle of poppy seed dressing over a mix of blackberries, nuts, greens, and cheese.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad storage\n------------------------\n\nBlackberry Salad doesn’t sit or store well once dressed. Once you assemble it, plan to eat it soon; otherwise, the dressing wilts the lettuce, the pears begin to brown, and the pecans soften.\n\nIf you make Blackberry Salad in advance, store all the components separately. Slice the pear and assemble the salad right before eating.\n\nMore salad recipes\n------------------\n\n*   [Beet and Goat Cheese Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/beet-and-goat-cheese-salad/) _with an orange-honey vinaigrette_\n*   [Olive Garden Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spiralized-cucumber-salad-with-olive-garden-dressing-copycat-video/) _with an Italian vinaigrette_\n*   [Chicken Taco Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-taco-salad/) _with a cilantro-lime vinaigrette_\n*   [Cucumber Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/cucumber-salad/) _with a balsamic vinaigrette_\n*   [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/) _on a spring Cobb salad_\n\n### Salad\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups (5 oz) spring lettuce mix (8 cups is loosely measured)\n*   ▢ 1 package (6 oz.) fresh blackberries\n*   ▢ 2 Anjou pears, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup chopped candied pecans (recipe for a full batch below)\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup crumbled goat or feta cheese\n\n### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup regular (full fat) mayo (I recommend Best Foods/Hellmans)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons EACH: whole milk, heavy cream, white granulated sugar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n*   ▢ pinch of sea salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds\n\n### Candied Pecans (Note 1)\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup white sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n*   ▢ 1 large egg white\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon water\n*   ▢ 1 pound pecan halves\n\n#### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   Combine all of the dressing ingredients, except the poppy seeds, in a blender and process until combined. Taste and adjust any flavors to personal preference. If you'd like a sweeter dressing, add an additional 1-2 teaspoons white sugar. Stir in the poppy seeds. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to serve. (Dressing stays good for 1 week stored in an airtight container in the fridge.)\n    \n\n#### Candied Pecans\n\n*   Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the white sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Stir to combine.\n    \n*   In another bowl, whisk the egg whites, vanilla, and water until frothy. Toss the pecans into this mixture and then remove, using a slotted spoon. Put the nuts into the sugar mixture and toss until well coated. Spread coated pecans onto a baking sheet.\n    \n*   Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are evenly browned. This takes about 45-60 minutes total. Let stand for 30-45 minutes to allow the pecans to fully cool and solidify. Coarsely chop for the salad.\n    \n\n#### For the Salad\n\n*   In a large salad bowl, toss together the spring lettuce mix and fresh (washed and completely dried) blackberries. Thinly slice pears. Add to the salad.\n    \n*   Add the chopped candied pecans, goat or feta cheese, and the dressing. (You may not want all of the dressing on the salad, so add to personal preference.) Toss and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Note 1**: Prep/cook time doesn't include the preparation of the candied pecans.\n\nSince it's a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly half the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nServing: 8servings | Calories: 181kcal | Carbohydrates: 15.7g | Protein: 2.2g | Fat: 13g | Cholesterol: 12.1mg | Sodium: 134.8mg | Fiber: 2.6g | Sugar: 12.4g\n\nWe do our best to provide accurate nutritional analysis for our recipes.

Everything gets tossed in a creamy maple tahini dressing and every bite is just magical. Here’s what you’ll need to make the salad:\n\n*   **Carrots:** you’ll start by grilling a few halved, large carrots so that they have those pretty grill marks. You’ll need some avocado or [olive oil](https://amzn.to/3nATNf7), salt and pepper.\n*   **Arugula:** the base of this salad is zippy, deliciously peppery arugula. It helps to balance all of the other mix-ins and the dressing.\n*   **Mix-ins:** we’re adding [dried fig halves](https://amzn.to/3yE6RqA) for sweetness, [walnut halves](https://amzn.to/3R21GId) for crunch, goat cheese for a little tang and savory flavor, and avocado for that amazing creaminess.\n*   **For the dressing:** tie the whole salad together with a dressing made with [tahini](https://amzn.to/3xJk6Ip), lemon juice, [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/3nygTD9), a little [dijon mustard](https://amzn.to/3ydAuNT), [garlic powder](https://amzn.to/3IeEWAM), salt & pepper.

Here’s what I can recommend:\n\n*   **Choose your mix-ins:** feel free to pick whatever mix-ins sound good to you like dried cranberries or dates, pecan halves, and feta cheese.\n*   **Add a boost of protein:** make the salad even more filling with 1/2 cup roasted chickpeas, grilled chicken or shrimp.\n*   **Pick your base:** I love the combo of carrots and arugula, but you could also grill sliced sweet potatoes and/or use a mixed green or spinach base.\n*   **Make it dairy free, vegan and/or paleo:** simply leave off the goat cheese! The salad will still be delicious.\n\n![drizzling a grilled carrot salad with tahini dressing](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Grilled-Carrot-Avocado-Fig-Arugula-Salad-2.jpg \"Beautiful grilled carrot arugula salad with sweet dried figs, tangy goat cheese, creamy avocado and crunchy walnuts.

Both are delicious and will give you perfectly tender carrots. Start by tossing the carrots in avocado oil, salt & pepper, then:\n\n*   **To grill:** place the halved carrots directly on the grill and grill them at medium high heat (about 400 degrees F) for 15-25 minutes total or until slightly tender, flipping halfway through.\n*   **To roast:** add the carrots to a [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3yG7xM9) lined with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/3ukfbZK) and roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender.\n\n![carrot arugula salad with avocado on a platter](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Grilled-Carrot-Avocado-Fig-Arugula-Salad-4.jpg \"Beautiful grilled carrot arugula salad with sweet dried figs, tangy goat cheese, creamy avocado and crunchy walnuts.

Use tongs or clean hands to coat the carrots with the oil.\n    \n*   Preheat the grill to medium high heat (about 400 degrees F) and grill the carrots for 15-25 minutes total or until slightly tender, flipping halfway through. Please note, if you don’t want to grill your carrots, you can roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n    \n*   Toast walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n    \n*   While the carrots are cooking you can make your dressing: in a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, dijon, garlic powder, water (1 tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency) and salt and pepper. Set aside.\n    \n*   Add arugula to a large platter (or you can keep it in a large bowl) and then layer with the toppings: grilled carrots, dried fig halves, toasted walnuts, goat cheese crumbles, avocado slices, and roasted chickpeas (if using).\n    \n*   Drizzle tahini dressing all over the top and season with freshly ground salt and pepper. Divide into bowls and enjoy! Salad keeps well for 2-4 days. Serves 4 as a main and 6 as a side salad.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**To roast the carrots:** add the carrots to a [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3yG7xM9) lined with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/3ukfbZK) and roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender.\n\nIf you’re not into a tahini dressing, I suggest my simple light maple apple cider vinaigrette for this salad. You can toss it with the arugula first or simply place it on the side and have guests drizzle over their salad before serving: 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey and freshly ground salt and pepper to taste.\n\nSee the full post for delicious & easy ways to customize your salad!\n\n### Nutrition\n\nServing: 1serving (based on 4)Calories: 421calCarbohydrates: 32.8gProtein: 11.7gFat: 28.7gSaturated Fat: 6gFiber: 5.9gSugar: 20.5g\n\nRecipe by: Monique Volz // Ambitious Kitchen | Photography by: [Eat Love Eats](https://eatloveeats.com/)\n\n_This post was originally published on July 5th, 2022, and republished on March 13th, 2024._"

    "markdown": "# Strawberry Salad - Strawberry Crunch Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette\nSay hello to the most delicious summery strawberry salad!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-9.jpg)\n\nThis strawberry crunch salad is going to be theeeee most made salad in my kitchen this year. I think. I mean, I have a lot of salads that I love, and even more coming to you this season. But if you’re a strawberry freak like I am, you will adorrrrreee this bowl. \n\nIt’s fresh, savory, creamy and crunchy. Ideal for what I require in a salad!\n\n![strawberries](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/strawberry-trifle-10.jpg)\n\nRemember [my blueberry (crunch) salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) that I shared last year? It was such a huge hit all summer and I knew I had to make a strawberry salad version. Where that one is a bit simpler, this one has more substance and could totally be a lunch salad because it’s incredibly satisfying.\n\nOn the same note, it’s still a salad that you could serve as a starter to dinner. It definitely works! \n\n![strawberry crunch salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-3.jpg)\n\nIf I’ve rambled about anything (everything?) on this blog, it’s that I.love.texture. Not even that I love texture, but I NEED texture. Especially in my salads. I can’t tell you how often I google “crunchy things for salads” when throwing together a house salad for dinner. It’s imperative for my mental and emotional and physical eating state.\n\n### Very important, clearly.\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-7.jpg)\n\nSo because of that, I like to use two varieties of nuts here. First, we’re making the sugared almonds from [the blueberry salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) because they are so fantastic. I highly suggest you don’t leave these out. They MAKE the dish. And they are easy too. You have to keep an eye on them but you can also prep them ahead of time. You can see me make them on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/howsweeteats/) today!\n\nThen on the flip side, I like to use roasted, salted pistachios. A sweet nut and a savory nut. Pistachios are one of my favorites – so buttery and rich. Having both nuts in the salad adds such a wonderful layer of crunch and flavor.\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-14.jpg)\n\nNext, the creamy avocado and goat cheese! I love using both of these too – the avocado is mild and the goat cheese is tangy. You can also sub in feta or leave out the cheese entirely if you don’t like goat. \n\nI love how the goat cheese melts into the whole salad when it’s tossed. It’s always my favorite part of goat cheese in a salad!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-15.jpg)\n\n### Finally, the strawberries!\n\nLeave them in halves or quarter them – or chop. Whatever you wish. I love that we are entering full blown strawberry season where they taste like actual candy. I’m also wondering how old that makes me sound, because when adults used to tell me that strawberries taste like candy when I was a kid, I’d look at them like they had ten heads.\n\nOf course, I’ve said this to Max and Emilia recently and while strawberries probably rank as one of their favorite foods, they do NOT think they are candy. Ha.\n\nI love to use a champagne vinaigrette on this salad because it’s still tangy and briney, but mild at the same time. It’s not quite as strong as red wine or apple cider vinegar. It adds a nice savory contrast to the salad, but still lets the other ingredients shine. The best dressing, in my opinion! Of course, feel free to use another one that you love here. The [creamy balsamic from my blueberry salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) would also be incredible. \n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-11.jpg)\n\nCan’t get enough of this beauty!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-5.jpg)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStrawberry Saladwith Champagne Vinaigrette\n------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-9-250x250.jpg)\n\nStrawberry Crunch Salad\n-----------------------\n\nYield: 4 people\n\nPrep Time: 25 minutes\n\nCook Time: 5 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 30 minutes\n\nThis strawberry salad is the best spring and summer meal! Super crunchy and textured with avocado and goat cheese. Absolutely delicious.\n\n#### salad\n\n*   ⅔ cup sliced or slivered almonds\n*   3 tablespoons [sugar](https://www.target.com/p/granulated-sugar-4lbs-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-78471310?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab)\n*   10 ounces arugula greens\n*   8 ounces [strawberries,](https://www.target.com/p/organic-strawberries-16oz/-/A-85762475?aflt=plt) hulled and quartered or chopped\n*   1 [avocado](https://www.target.com/p/hass-avocados-4ct-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-81957708?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab) chopped\n*   2 ounces crumbled goat cheese,\n*   ⅓ cup roasted salted pistachios, chopped\n\n*   Place the almonds in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and cook, stirring often, until the sugar melts and is caramely, coating all of the almonds - about 6 to 8 minutes. Don’t take your eyes off of this as they can burn quickly! Transfer the almonds to a piece of parchment paper to let them cool. Break them into pieces if they are clumped.\n    \n*   Toss the arugula with a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add in the strawberries, avocado, goat cheese, pistachios and sugared almonds. Drizzle on the dressing and toss well. Serve immediately!\n    \n*   champagne vinaigrette\n    \n*   Combine vinegar, honey, lemon juice, dijon, garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl and whisk together. Stream in the olive oil while constantly whisking until the dressing comes together. Store in the fridge for up to one week.\n    \n\nCourse: Salad\n\nCuisine: American\n\n![up close strawberry salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-22.jpg)\n\nBest ever."

Temp in the 60's and sunshiny every day? Right. Absoltely no complaints here that the chilly, rainy days are back and Spring is on hiatus. Honestly, couldn't be happier.\n\n![Bell Pepper Avocado Tomato](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bell-pepper-avocado-tomato.jpg)![Romaine and Baby Spring Mix](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/romaine-and-baby-spring-mix.jpg)\n\nHowever, this salad is a reminder of more warm and sunny days to come. What better way to say hello to the sun than with a southwestern style chipotle salad? And with easy, homemade tortilla strips?

The tortilla strips are SO GOOD! I find myself munching on them while I toss the rest of the ingredients together. Find a decent hiding place for them or there'll be none left to garnish this colorful, delectable salad!\n\n![Southwest Chipotle Salad Table Set](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/southwest-chipotle-salad-table-set.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/2015/04/southwest-chipotle-salad-with-homemade-tortilla-strips/print/7206/)\n\n*   1 15 oz can black beans, drained\n*   1 16 oz carton grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise\n*   1 cup cooked corn kernels\n*   1 cup red and orange bell pepper, diced\n*   1 avocado, diced\n*   10 oz bag chopped romaine lettuce\n*   1 lb baby spring mix\n*   Chipotle dressing\n*   1 bunch cilantro, lightly diced for garnish\n*   Queso fresco, crumbled\n*   10 corn tortillas, sliced into 2 inch strips\n*   2 cups canola oil, or enough oil to cover up to a ¼ inch of your skillet\n*   Coarse salt\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n* * *\n\n1.  Pour canola oil into a frying pan or skillet and turn heat to medium. Test the oil by flicking water on it. If it sizzles, add about half of the tortilla strips (If it splatters, turn heat down a little bit).\n2.  Stirring frequently to avoid burning, cook strips until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove to a paper towel and sprinkle with coarse salt. Repeat with the second half of your tortilla strips. Set aside to cool.\n3.  Toss romaine and spring mix together in a large mixing bowl.\n4.  Add black beans, tomatoes, corn, bell pepper, and avocado. Toss to combine.\n5.  Top with tortilla strips, cilantro, queso fresco, and drizzle with chipotle dressing.\n\n*   Prep Time: 15 mins\n*   Cook Time: 5 mins\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

It is a super simple to make marinade, that offers great flavors in as little as 20 minutes. I loved how flavorful this chicken turned out.\n2.  Then you have the [cucumber salad](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/greek-cucumber-salad-2/ \"Greek Cucumber Salad\"). It is a pretty simple recipe that utilizes fresh cucumbers, lemon, and seasonings.

I love these because they are divided into 3 compartments, are washable (dishwasher safe) and reusable, and come in [black](https://amzn.to/2vGSDmo) or [green](https://amzn.to/2vGwkxj), so I can make one with more garlic for me and less garlic for the husband, and we can know which is which.\n*   For additional meal prep, check out this [cookbook featuring 100+ ideas](https://amzn.to/2iRhw6T) or try this recipe for [ITALIAN CHICKEN MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) or [TACO MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   I loved this [meal prep lunch bag](https://amzn.to/2jFBXaY) for keeping things cool and organized.\n*   Meal prep with multiple people and swap to avoid eating the same thing all week.\n*   This meal is best within 3 days, but is good up to 5 days.\n*    This does NOT have to be a meal prep, it also serves as a delicious family dinner option!\n*   Start your brown rice in a [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2iIkrE0), or use something like these [Ready To Serve Rice Bowls](https://amzn.to/2jTaTTC) to speed up meal prep.\n\n### More Meal Prep Ideas\n\nOther Easy Meals you May Enjoy and could work for Meal Prep:\n\n*   [Flank Steak Sheet Pan Fajitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-flank-steak-fajitas/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Garlic Chicken](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-garlic-chicken-veggies/)\n*   [Chicken and Veggie Pitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/10-minute-grilled-chicken-protein-pitas/)\n*   [Taco Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) \n\n![Greek chicken meal prep bowls are easy to make and deliciously healthy.](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/greek-chicken-meal-prep-3-1-320x320.jpg)\n\n#### Greek Chicken\n\n*   2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts\n*   1/4 cup olive oil\n*   3 Tbs garlic minced (Note, adjust to preference)\n*   1/3 cup fresh lemon juice\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1 Tbs dried oregano\n*   1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n#### Cucumber Salad\n\n*   2 English cucumbers peeled and sliced\n*   1/3 cup lemon juice\n*   2 Tbs olive oil\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1/2 Tbs minced garlic\n*   1/2 tsp dried oregano\n\n#### Tzatziki Sauce\n\n*   1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   1 English cucumber finely diced\n*   1 tsp \\- up to 1 Tbs minced garlic adjust to garlic preference\n*   1/2 Tbs dill weed or 1 Tbs fresh dill, chopped fine\n*   1 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tsp lemon zest\n*   1/2 tsp chopped fresh mint optional\n*   Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### The Rest\n\n*   3 cups cooked brown rice\n*   1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes halved\n*   1/2 cup red onion slices\n\n*   In a large plastic zip bag, combine olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, greek yogurts and salt and pepper. Massage to mix.\n    \n*   Add chicken into the bag.\n    \n*   Massage to make sure chicken is full covered and marinate for at least 20 minutes, up to 12 hours.\n    \n*   Drain the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade.\n    \n*   In a skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat.\n    \n*   I used my [Anolon Skillet](http://amzn.to/2vGtydc) which I love because it heats evenly, is metal utensil friendly, and can be used in the oven up to 400 degrees.\n    \n*   Add chicken when it is hot, and cook, flipping part way through. Cook approximately 3-4 minutes per side. Cooking time depends on thickness and size of the chicken. Cook until internal temp is 165 degrees.\n    \n*   Remove from pan, and let cool.\n    \n*   Once cool, cut into bite sized pieces. Just make sure you let it cool, or all the juice will run out.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, make cucumber salad by chunking the cucumbers, and tossing in a bowl with the lemon juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and oregano. Set aside\n    \n*   Make tzatziki sauce by combining the Greek yogurt, cucumber, garlic, dill weed, lemon juice, lemon zest in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. And add mint (optional)\n    \n*   Refrigerate while assembling your bowls.\n    \n*   Cook brown rice according to package directions. When finished cooking, divide between meal prep containers, 1/2 cup in each container, halve cherry tomatoes, and mix with red onion slices. Divide amongst the bowls.\n    \n*   Top with chicken, cucumber salad, and some tzatziki sauce.\n    \n*   Keep for 3- 5 days in airtight container, serve cold!\n    \n\n\\* Adjust garlic to your preference. I love garlic. Cut back if you don't (in marinade and tzatziki sauce)  \nThe marinade should be drained off, you don't want to eat all that garlic, just use it to flavor your chicken.  \n\\*\\* Another great meal prep option are these [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nRecipe adapted from [Damn Delicious](http://damndelicious.net/2016/11/16/greek-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nCalories: 521kcal | Carbohydrates: 40g | Protein: 43g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 97mg | Sodium: 109mg | Potassium: 1246mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 8g | Vitamin A: 725IU | Vitamin C: 44.1mg | Calcium: 126mg | Iron: 3mg\n\nOur recipe card software calculates these nutrition facts based on averages for the above ingredients, different brands, and quality of produce/meats may have different nutritional information, always calculate your own based on the specific products you use in order to achieve accurate macros for this recipe.\n\n![](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thumbnail_App-Icon.png) Try PrePear, my FREE Meal Planning App that allows you to save your recipes, plan meals, shop for groceries, and cook simply in one place.

I mean, who doesn’t love throwing everything into a pot that cooks itself? SIGN ME UP.\n\nA solid slow cooker recipe is what all of us need in our hip pockets. Especially one that is as crazy tasty as this!\n\nSo why do you need this Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl? Let me count the ways…\n\n*   Oh so easy! Let the slow cooker do ALL the hard work\n*   Great flavors – chicken is cooked in tomatoes, jalapeño, cilantro, lime…not lacking in the flavor department over here!\n*   Lots of textures – i.e. corn, beans, avocado, cilantro…\n*   So versatile – mix and match to create the Chicken Burrito Bowl of your dreams\n*   Leftovers! This recipe makes at least 6 servings (depending on how hungry you are) and will probably give you lunch and dinner for another day or two!\n\n![Bowl filled with chicken, corn, black beans, shredded cheese, avocados, cilantro and la wedge of lime](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-1.jpg)\n\nAnd yes, it tastes as dreamy as it looks….\n\nCooking chicken in slow cooker or crockpot\n------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, let’s talk about how to make the chicken. Think of this as a slow cooker (or some call it crockpot) chicken recipe inspired by yummy Mexican flavors, so you will find all the good stuff such as jalapeños, cumin, chili powder, and cilantro involved.\n\nThe best part is, with a crockpot and all the delicious spices/sauces we are adding, making the chicken flavorful, tender and delicious requires almost zero efforts.\n\nWell, maybe a little effort. 😉 As little as combining all the ingredients into the slow cooker.\n\nThese ingredients are:\n\n*   chicken – I used chicken breast, but chicken thighs work as well\n*   chicken broth\n*   salsa (I like to use chunky salsa, but pick your favorite!)\n*   smoked paprika\n*   cumin\n*   chili powder\n*   BRIANNAS Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nJust dump it all in the slow cooker, cover, and let it do its thing for 4 hours on high.\n\nI do want to pause and take a moment to reflect on how much I’m loving BRIANNAS salad dressings. I recently discovered that they are not just amazing salad dressings, they actually have multiple super powers.\n\n![Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing in the background](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-5.jpg)\n\nSuper power #1: makes salads taste amazing. But we know that already.\n\nSuper power #2: it’s an INCREDIBLE marinade. And works like magic in the crockpot!\n\nThat is right. Made out of quality ingredients, they make amazing marinades for your favorite protein. Like mind-blowing, over-the-fence, cannot-get-enough kind of incredible.\n\nHere’s the best part: you can search for BRIANNAS dressings near you [HERE](https://www.briannas.com/where-to-buy/) and join in the fun!\n\nThis Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing has yummy flavors of jalapeño, cilantro and lime in it, and it takes the flavors of our slow cooker chicken to the next level. In addition (because why stop there?), it also gives the sauce a slightly thicker, creamier texture.\n\nTranslation: I love this dressing; I love this Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl. Lots of love going around.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooked on high for 4 hours, shred it. You will find that the chicken will easily fall apart.\n\n![Shredding chicken in a crockpot using a pair of tongs](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-7.jpg)\n\nShredded Chicken in the crockpot\n\nNext, let the shredded chicken sit for about 10 minutes so it soaks in the yummy juices. Yum yum yum.\n\n**All the ways to serve Chicken Burrito Bowl!**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSomething else I love – the versatility of Chicken Burrito Bowl.\n\nServe the chicken with some (or all) of these yummy ingredients. Mix and match to your heart’s content. Make the Chicken Burrito Bowl of your dream.\n\nBest of all, these ingredients take little to no time to prepare:\n\n*   Rice – white or brown rice, or grab a box of Spanish rice or Mexican rice!\n*   Beans\n*   Corn\n*   Avocado\n*   Cheese\n*   Tortilla Chips\n*   Tomatoes\n*   Pico de Gallo\n*   My [Quick 15 Minutes Queso](https://www.joyousapron.com/easy-15-minute-queso-cheese-dip/)\n*   My [Homemade Guacamole](https://www.joyousapron.com/homemade-chunky-guacamole/)\n*   Jalapeños, if you like it spicy!\n\nSqueeze some lime juice onto the bowl, drizzle it with more BRIANNAS’ Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nDIG IN and enjoy that lovely Chicken Burrito Bowl that you just tailor made for yourself!\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing on the side](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-3.jpg)\n\nFlavorful, so much texture, pretty healthy, and so much going on in a simple bowl. I adore this delicious Chicken Burrito Bowl made in the slow cooker, and I have a suspicion that you would too!\n\nTips and Tricks\n---------------\n\nHere are some additional tips and tricks when making Chicken Burrito Bowl using the crockpot:\n\n*   When shredding the chicken, use a pair of tongs and fork to shred it. It should come apart really easily!\n*   Taste the chicken after you shred it, and if needed add salt to open up the flavors. I did not add salt, but whether salt is needed will depend on the chicken broth and/or salsa used.\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-4.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can you freeze Slow Cooker Chicken?**\n\nAbsolutely! Store in an airtight container in either the refrigerator or freezer. If you are storing it in the refrigerator, consume within 5 days. They store really well and make great leftovers and meal prep! Store ingredients separately and tailor make your Chicken Burrito Bowl when ready to eat!\n\n**How do I make the chicken in the Instant pot?**\n\nPressure cook on high for 15 minutes in the Instant Pot.\n\n**How do I make this low carb?**\n\nUse cauliflower rice instead of white or brown rice.\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS RECIPE?

    "markdown": "# Crockpot Chicken Fajitas + VIDEO - Fit Slow Cooker Queen\nThis **slow cooker chicken fajitas** recipe only has 5 ingredients: chicken, onions, bell peppers, diced tomatoes, and fajita seasoning. Quick and tasty, you can serve this healthy (low-carb, paleo, Whole30) fajita dish with your favorite accompaniments. Instructions to make this simple fajita recipe in the Instant Pot are also included. \n\n![side view shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-2.jpg)\n\nIngredients For Chicken Fajitas (ONLY 5)\n----------------------------------------\n\nThere are only 5 ingredients in the easy fajita recipe! \n\n1.  **Chicken:** Boneless, skinless breasts (or thighs).\n2.  **Fajita Seasoning:** My homemade fajita blend is included in the recipe box. If you have your own, feel free to use it. \n3.  **Bell Peppers:** 3 large bell peppers. I used green, red, and orange so it would be colorful. 3 bell peppers of the same color works just fine. \n4.  **Onions:** 1 large onion or 2 small onions. Don’t slice them too thin. \n5.  **Tomatoes:** 14.5-ounce can of diced tomatoes or your favorite salsa\n\n![collage of the chicken fajita ingredients](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-6.jpg)\n\nHow To Make Chicken Fajitas In The Crock-Pot\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMaking chicken fajitas is very easy, especially when you use your slow cooker (Crock-Pot) or pressure cooker (Instant Pot). \n\n[**Slow Cooker**](https://amzn.to/2OuNJ7r)\n\n1.  Season the chicken with salt & pepper. Add the chicken & all the other ingredients to the slow cooker. Stir to mix well.\n2.  Cook HIGH 2-3 hours or LOW 4-6.\n\n**[Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2OriB8u)** \n\n1.  Turn the Instant Pot to sauté. Once hot, add the oil, onion, and bell pepper and cook 3-5 minutes until soft.\n2.  Season the chicken with salt & pepper. Add the seasoned chicken, diced tomatoes, and all the other  seasonings to the pot. Stir to mix well. Close lid and seal valve. Set **high pressure** and cook **8 minutes**. When cooking time is complete, quick release pressure.\n\n![](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-10.jpg)\n\nbefore (slow cooker)\n\nChicken Breasts or Chicken Thighs?\n----------------------------------\n\nNormally my go-to cut of chicken when I use my slow cooker is chicken thighs. I used chicken breasts here. I prefer to use breasts in particular with fajitas. You can also make these with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. If you do, add an additional 30 minutes to an hour of cook time for the slow cooker and 1 minutes for the pressure cooker. You need to do this because dark meat takes longer to cook than white meat. Since this recipe uses chicken breasts, it’s not a recipe that can sit on the WARM setting. This will overcook the chicken and dry out the meat. When the food is done cooking, turn off the appliance. \n\n![](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-3.jpg)\n\nafter (slow cooker)\n\nHomemade Fajita Seasoning\n-------------------------\n\nIn the recipe box you will find my go-to homemade fajita seasoning. If you use it (which I hop you do) then technically this is recipe is more than 5 ingredients.  Hopefully you already have these spices in your pantry already. My fajita spice blend makes about 1/3 cup of seasonings. Personally, I make a big batch and keep it in my pantry.\n\n![overhead shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-4.jpg)\n\nHow To Serve The Fajitas\n------------------------\n\nTraditionally fajitas are served in corn or flour tortillas. I believe you should serve these fajitas according to your dietary restrictions. My go-to is lettuce wraps. Other suggestions are tortillas or over rice (regular, brown, or riced cauliflower). You can also use this as filling for burritos or even enchiladas. Popular garnishes for fajitas include cheese, guacamole, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, etc. \n\n![side view shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-7.jpg)\n\nFAQs & Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Store leftover fajitas in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. \n*   I used a [6-quart slow cooker](https://amzn.to/2O382Kj) or [Instant Pot.](https://amzn.to/2OzHIH6)\n\n**Mexican Inspired Recipes**\n----------------------------\n\n*   [**Steak Fajitas**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-steak-fajitas/)\n*   [**Salsa Verde Chicken**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken/)\n*   **[Cilantro-Lime Beef](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-carne-asada/)** \n*   **[Enchilada Tri-Tip](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-mexican-tri-tip-paleo-whole30/)**\n*   [**Salsa Verde Beef**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/video-slow-cooker-instant-pot-salsa-verde-beef-low-carb-paleo-whole30/)\n\n[Print](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/video-slow-cooker-instant-pot-chicken-fajitas-low-carb-paleo-whole30/print/11014/)\n\n![overhead shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-8.jpg)\n\n*   2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips\n*   3 large bell peppers, sliced\n*   1 large onion or 2 small onions, sliced\n*   15 ounces diced tomatoes or salsa\n*   1/3 cup fajita seasonings (see below for homemade blend)\n*   Salt & pepper to season the chicken\n*   3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth (for Instant Pot only)\n\n**Homemade Fajita Seasoning**\n\n*   2 tablespoons chili powder\n*   1 tablespoon cumin\n*   1 1/2 teaspoons salt (or more)\n*   1 1/2 teaspoon oregano\n*   1 teaspoon paprika\n*   1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   1 teaspoon onion powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n[**Slow Cooker**](https://amzn.to/2OuNJ7r)\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Slow Cooker Meatballs in Tomato Sauce | Living Lou\n_These slow cooker meatballs are a traditional, Italian style meatballs made with ground beef and pork, Parmesan cheese, herbs and spices. They are slow simmered in tomato sauce, to tender perfection in the crock pot and are perfect served over spaghetti. This post was originally published in 2014._\n\n[![Beef meatballs in slow cooker with tomato sauce and basil.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker.jpg)](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker/)\n\n[](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker/)[Jump to Recipe](#recipe)\n\n6 hours 25 minutes\n\nI’ve been a big fan of the slow cooker for _years._ And then the pressure cooker came around and I feel like people kind of forgot about the beauty of the slow cooker. The hands-off nature of it. My favourite that I’ve had for eight years is this [6-quart slow cooker from KitchenAid](https://amzn.to/39yPLv7). \n\nThis meatball recipe is as easy as any meatball recipe out there. The first step is to mix the ingredients for the tomato sauce in the slow cooker, and then you mix and shape the meatballs. And everything cooks in the slow cooker at the same time. \n\nYes, you read that right. All you need to do is turn your slow cooker on. \n\n[![Closeup of slow cooker meatballs on a spoon with basil sprinkled on top.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/slow-cooker-giant-meatballs.jpg)](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/slow-cooker-giant-meatballs/)\n\n### Do I need to brown the meatballs before putting them in the slow cooker? \n\nWith this recipe, there is no need to brown the meatballs. They hold their shape and cook perfectly and end up tender and juicy in the slow cooker. You could also try using this method with my [turkey and spinach meatballs](https://www.livinglou.com/turkey-and-spinach-meatballs/).\n\nThe meatballs are gently simmered in the crockpot and the tomato sauce becomes luscious and rich. I like to use mixture of lean ground beef and pork for these so that the sauce doesn’t become greasy. \n\n[![Italian beef meatballs in the slow cooker with tomato sauce.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/slow-cooker-meatballs.jpg)](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/slow-cooker-meatballs/)\n\nThe secret to these meatballs comes from dried fennel. I find it gives them a hint of fennel without being overpowering. Think of the meatballs you’d have at your favourite Italian restaurant. \n\nThe other secret to a rich, slow cooker tomato sauce comes from using an entire can of tomato paste. This adds a depth of flavour to the tomato sauce that you’d find in a slow simmered tomato sauce. \n\n![Beef meatballs in slow cooker with tomato sauce and basil.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker-190x190.jpg)\n\n#### For Tomato Sauce\n\n*   1 28oz can whole tomatoes, broken up with a spoon\n*   1 5.5 oz can tomato paste\n*   1 onion, chopped\n*   1 carrot, chopped\n*   4 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 teaspoon sugar\n*   ½ teaspoon salt\n*   ¼ teaspoon chili flakes\n*   10 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced, for garnish\n\n#### For Meatballs\n\n*   1 lb lean ground beef\n*   1 lb lean ground pork\n*   2 eggs\n*   ¾ cup bread crumbs\n*   ⅓ cup milk\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   ¼ cup minced parsley\n*   ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese\n*   ½ teaspoon fennel, crushed\n*   ½ teaspoon salt\n*   ¼ teaspoon pepper\n\n*   In the slow cooker, combine whole tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, carrot, garlic, salt and hot pepper flakes.\n    \n*   In a large bowl, mix beef, pork, eggs, bread crumbs, milk, garlic, parsley, Parmesan cheese, fennel seeds, salt and pepper until combined.\n    \n*   Shape in 12 large meatballs and arrange meatballs on top of tomato sauce in the slow cooker.\n    \n*   Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours, until carrots are tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into several meatballs reads 160F. Skim off fat. Serve sprinkled with basil.\n    \n\nLeave a comment + rating and let me know what you think!\n\n![Slow cooker meatballs in tomato sauce serve on pasta](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/monster-meatballs-in-tomato-sauce-1.jpg)\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

These burrito bowls are **full of chili-spiced [brown rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice-113856), [black beans,](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-black-bean-recipes-227509) [corn](https://www.thekitchn.com/corn-recipes-259912), and yes, tender bites of [shredded chicken](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-shredded-chicken-in-the-slow-cooker-231481)**. Everything gets cooked right in the pot, so all you need to do is dish yourself a bowl and sprinkle with cheese.\n\nTwo Stages of the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nI usually do this recipe in two stages. First, I get the [chicken](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-chicken-recipes-261543) going with some [broth](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-stock-and-broth-word-of-mouth-71199) and diced tomatoes, and then I add the [rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-rice-on-the-stove-44333), [beans](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-beans-on-the-stove-182717), and corn midway through cooking. This ensures that everything finishes cooking at the same time and the beans don’t get too mushy.\n\nIf I’m going to be gone for a while and won’t be home to add the rice, I just leave it out of the slow cooker and cook it separately on the stovetop just before serving. It dirties one more pot, but it gives me some flexibility with my schedule.\n\nKeep an Eye on the Rice\n-----------------------\n\nThe first few times you make this, pay special attention to the rice. I like using [brown rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/slow-cooker-brown-rice-259084) here because it holds its shape better over longer cooking, but it can be a bit hard to judge exactly when it will be done.\n\nI use a basic grocery-store brand of rice and it typically finishes cooking in 3 1/2 hours on low in this recipe; whichever brand or variety you use, I suggest checking it after about 2 1/2 hours to see how quickly it’s cooking and if it needs more liquid. (Speaking of liquid, you’ll get some from the [canned tomatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/25-ways-to-use-canned-tomatoes-261469), so you won’t need to add as much broth as you normally would if you were cooking the rice by itself. Even so, use your best judgement if you think more or less liquid is needed.)\n\nI use my small three-quart slow cooker for this recipe. It’s just big enough to fit everything at once and give the rice plenty of room to expand as it cooks. If you have a larger slow cooker, I’d suggest doubling the recipe and freezing half for other meals.\n\nWays To Enjoy the Chicken Burrito Bowl\n--------------------------------------\n\nOne of the best things about this recipe, aside from how easy it is to make, is the way all the flavors and ingredients mingle during cooking. The chicken cooks in a tomato-rich, cumin-spiked broth, which then gets absorbed by the rice later on. Every bite ends up deeply seasoned and fragrant with spices.\n\nEat it in a bowl with slices of [avocado](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-slice-an-avocado-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-200500) and a dollop of [sour cream](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-sour-cream-23386619), or roll it up in a [burrito](https://www.thekitchn.com/easy-bean-rice-burrito-recipe-23024697) for lunch. Either way, it’s a win. This simple slow-cooker meal has more than earned its spot in my regular lineup.\n\n[Comments](#comments-207333)\n\nThese chicken burrito bowls only require five minutes of hands-on prep time — the rest of the work is done by your slow cooker.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 to 1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken thighs, or a mix\n    \n*   1 (14.5-ounce) can\n    \n    diced tomatoes\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed\n    \n*   2 teaspoons\n    \n    chili powder\n    \n*   2 teaspoons\n    \n    salt\n    \n*   1 teaspoon\n    \n    ground cumin\n    \n*   1 (15-ounce) can\n    \n    black beans, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    uncooked brown rice\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    frozen corn kernels\n    \n*   _Optional toppings:_ shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, sour cream, diced avocado, salsa, hot sauce, diced green onions, shredded lettuce\n    \n\n1.  Combine the chicken, diced tomatoes and their juices, chicken broth, chili powder, salt, and cumin in a 2 1/2- to 3 1/2-quart slow cooker. Make sure the chicken is covered with liquid, adding additional broth as needed. Cover and cook on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours.\n    \n2.  Uncover and stir in the beans, rice, and corn. Cover and continue cooking on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours more. Check the rice periodically in the last hour of cooking, stirring once or twice to make sure the rice cooks evenly and adding more chicken broth if the mixture seems dry. Cooking is done when the rice is tender — if the rice is done but there is still liquid left in the slow cooker, uncover and cook on the HIGH setting to let the liquid evaporate.\n    \n3.  Use 2 forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. You can do this either in the slow cooker itself and then mix it into the rice, or you can transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board if you prefer to keep it separate. Taste and stir in more salt or other seasonings as needed. Serve burrito bowls with a selection of toppings.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Cooking the rice separately:** If you won't be home to add the rice to the slow cooker, you can skip this step and cook it separately on the stovetop just before serving (use [these directions](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice-113856)). To modify the recipe, combine the chicken, diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of stock, and spices in the slow cooker and cook for 6 to 8 hours on the LOW setting. Add the beans and corn and cook for 30 minutes more, or until warmed through, while you're cooking the rice (omit the remaining chicken broth).\n\n**Vegetarian burrito bowls:** Combine the diced tomatoes, 1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth, spices, rice, black beans, and corn in the slow cooker. Cook on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours, until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Stir once or twice toward the end of cooking to make sure the rice is cooking evenly.\n\n**Beyond burrito bowls**: Besides burrito bowls, you can use this filling to make regular tortilla-wrapped burritos or [freezer burritos](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-i-make-burritos-to-freeze-freezer-friendly-from-jessica-fisher-198682).\n\n**Storage:** The burrito mixture will keep for 1 week refrigerated or for 3 months in the freezer."

The rich and chunky ragu is packed with vibrant flavour and is so satisfying to eat. Use it with pasta or in lasagna and freeze the rest!**_\n\nNot planning to use a slow cooker? Check out my [Tuscan Ragu](https://vikalinka.com/tuscan-ragu/)!\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a piece of chunky bread and a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-3-Edit.jpg)\n\nI am going to admit openly that I am not a big fan of crock pots. Mine doesn’t get used very often, mostly because I enjoy the cooking process and am too much of a control freak to let the slow cooker take over.\n\nI also find meals cooked in a crock pot taste too similar to each other. They taste like stew. I like stew but not every day of the week.\n\nI am however, a HUGE fan of tender, melt-in-your-mouth, big and bold flavour meat. And if a slow cooker has to take the centre stage for this to happen, so be it. I suppose I can share the limelight…for one day.\n\n![Bowl of pasta in beef ragu](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-23-Edit.jpg)\n\nHave you ever had a really tasty and satisfying Italian beef ragu at your favourite Italian restaurant? I am talking about rich and satisfying meat based tomato sauce that’s been cooked for hours allowing for deep flavours to build and blend into a beautiful medley.\n\nI really love rustic dishes that look scruffy and taste earthy. While this may not exactly be food art it is a beautiful sight nonetheless. And I can’t even begin to describe how tender and flavourful this ragu is!\n\nTruth is, not all incredible food needs to be high cuisine. Sometimes all we need is kick-ass flavour to turn dinner into something special.\n\nAnd this ragu has heaps of flavour, with savoury beef, sweet and acidic tomatoes and rich red wine. Truly this is the king of pasta sauces!\n\n![close up of beef ragu in a pot](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MG_1602-3-682x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat is Italian Beef Ragu?\n--------------------------\n\nJust imagine a 4 pound hunk of beef smothered in plum Italian tomatoes, fresh rosemary and thyme. Then it is sprinkled with salt and pepper and minced garlic and drowned in half a bottle of Chianti. It is then left simmering slowly for 12…that’s right, 12 hours over low heat.\n\nHow can it not taste divine?\n\nItalian Beef Ragu and Bolognese sauces are twins but not exactly the same. There are differences but they are so subtle that many Italians use the words interchangeably.\n\nThe main characteristic of the beef ragu is it’s heavily meat-based sauce. If you see more meat than tomato, you’ve got yourself a proper Italian beef ragu.\n\nThe bold taste of this sauce will leave you gobsmacked. I mean in a complete disbelief that you barely lifted a finger for this awesomeness to come out of your kitchen. Crock pot, you win.\n\nBeef ragu pasta\n---------------\n\nYou are probably wondering how to eat this delicious sauce. Well, seeing that it’s Italian I served it with pappardelle pasta and and generous grating of parmesan cheese.\n\nActually you can serve this beef ragu with any pasta of your choice.  Just bear in mind that it’s a robust sauce, so your pasta should match it.\n\nNo delicate capellini or even spaghetti will do quite as well.  It will, however, taste great with rigatoni, penne or any other sturdy pasta.\n\n![Top down of a bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-25-Edit-2.jpg)\n\nRecipe tips and notes\n---------------------\n\n*   Because of the slow cooking process and the number of other flavours added to the beef, there isn’t a lot of benefit in buying an expensive cut of meat. This is a good recipe to save money on a cheap cut of meat, which will become tender and flavourful as it cooks.\n*   The red wine is an amazing source of flavour for a ragu and I always keep a bottle on hand to use in recipes like this. If you don’t want to cook with wine, it can be replaced with beef stock.\n*   Barley is optional, but is a great way to thicken the ragu while adding nutrition. Barley doesn’t add a lot of flavour beyond a subtle nuttiness, but makes the ragu creamier by releasing starch during the cooking process.\n*   A hearty pasta sauce needs a hearty pasta, so choose a thick pasta like pappardelle, fettuccine or tagliatelle.\n\nServing suggestions\n-------------------\n\nServing this ragu with pasta may be the most obvious way to go, but it also could be the best. The rich sauce and chunks of beef coat pasta beautifully, especially when using a thick and hearty pasta like pappardelle or tagliatelle.\n\nIt’s a rich pasta sauce, so is at its best when paired with something lighter that can cut through the beef. My go-to is a [caprese salad](https://vikalinka.com/tomato-salad-basil-mozzarella-caprese/) with sweet tomatoes and fresh basil, but a simple green salad will also do nicely. I also love adding [garlic bread](https://vikalinka.com/air-fryer-garlic-bread/) to soak up any remaining sauce.\n\nAlthough this delicious beef ragu is Italian by origin don’t let it stop you from serving it with anything you can think of. At the end of our dinner tonight, we all agreed this meat would taste absolutely amazing in a burrito, served on top of rice or even with some potatoes.\n\nStorage and leftovers\n---------------------\n\nThis Italian beef ragu incredibly versatile and because you cook a whole roast you are bound to have lots of leftovers.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to use leftover ragu other than serving it with pasta. I’ve actually used it in two different recipes: [Rustic Three Cheese Lasagna](https://vikalinka.com/2014/05/12/rustic-three-cheese-lasagna/) and [Italian Beef and Roasted Red Pepper Quesadillas](https://vikalinka.com/2014/03/19/italian-beef-and-roasted-red-pepper-quesadillas-with-tomato-and-basil-salsa/).\n\nThis ragu freezes absolutely beautifully!  And let me tell you, you will be so pleased to find a container of this goodness on a night when you can’t possibly face spending a long time in the kitchen!\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a piece of chunky bread and a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-3-Edit-320x320.jpg)\n\nCrock Pot Rustic Italian Beef Ragu\n----------------------------------\n\nRich Italian beef ragu slowly simmered in your slow cooker for maximum flavour.

The long and slow cooking time makes all the flavors meld well. This is in addition to the rich combination of spices included in the marinade, make this dish irresistible.\n\nMy family and I discovered this dish while visiting India years ago, and we all loved it. Of course, I had to try and make it. And if I do say so myself, the results are even better than the one we tried! The trick to this recipe is the slow cooker. Letting it do all the work for you while you go on your day is awesome, and you get to return to a delicious meal at the end of the day!\n\nI start by marinating my chicken the night before. Just leave it in the fridge to soak up all the flavors. Then, before I leave for the day, I sauté it and put it in the slow cooker with the sauce to cook while I am out. If you need your chicken sooner, you can cook it on high for three to four hours. However, for the best flavor and most tender chicken, I recommend cooking on low for six to seven hours.\n\nWhy you will love this recipe\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **It is so easy:** Marinate the chicken the night before. Then sauté the chicken and toss it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients before enjoying your day. Then, you can come back to a delicious but easy meal.\n*   **Authentic flavor:** If your goal is to serve an authentic Indian meal, this one you should definitely try.\n*   **Leftovers taste incredible:** Some recipes taste better the next day. This crockpot butter chicken is one of them. Save some for lunch or dinner tomorrow.\n*   **Make it your way:** Although I prefer this dish just the way it is, sometimes I like to mix it up by adding or removing some of the ingredients. For example, when I have people sensitive to spicy foods, I leave out chili powder and garam masala.\n\n![a wooden spoon with creamy Indian butter chicken](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals3-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nWhat you’ll need to make slow cooker butter chicken\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Special items:\n\n*   **Slow cooker** – Whether you have a slow cooker or crockpot, the directions are the same.\n*   **Large skillet** – For sautéing the chicken. \n*   **Wooden spoon –** I prefer wooden utensils because they do not scratch the ceramic in my slow cooker.\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n*   **Chicken –** I use skinless boneless chicken thighs because they are easy to prepare, and my family prefers white meat. Whatever meat you use, just cut it into two-inch cubes.\n*   **Yogurt**—Plain Greek yogurt is my preference for this marinade. It adds a nice, mellow acid with a mild, creamy flavor.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Garlic powder**—I put garlic powder in just about everything, and it is perfect for marinating chicken because it is concentrated and will add more garlic taste.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Turmeric –** A popular curry spice, turmeric adds an earthy background with hints of pepper, ginger, and sweetness. Some say it tastes similar to mustard. It can also be somewhat bitter if you use too much.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red chili powder and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your marinade a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer to use sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n\n### For the sauce:\n\n*   **Olive oil –** I always use extra virgin olive oil because it is light and has a mild flavor**.** In this recipe, it is used to sauté the chicken.\n*   **Butter**—Because butter is the star of this dish, I only use the highest-quality butter without salt. If your butter has salt, remove it from the sauce ingredients.\n*   **Onion –** Minced and sauteed to add a fresh onion flavor without any bitterness that the powder has.\n*   **Garlic –** Also minced and sauteed, fresh garlic gives your sauce a deep, rich garlic taste.\n*   **Tomato sauce**—Another important ingredient. I prefer to use organic tomatoes to make my own, but you can use your favorite brand.\n*   **Evaporated milk –** Any kind of evaporated milk will do, but the better the quality, the better the flavor.\n*   **Heavy cream**—Do not substitute this ingredient unless you really have to because it gives your sauce the creaminess it needs to taste authentic.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your sauce a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n*   **Black pepper –** Grind your own from fresh peppercorns for the best taste.\n*   **Sugar –** I use granulated white sugar for sweetness, but you could use honey or maple syrup.\n\nHow to make slow cooker butter chicken?\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** The night before (or at least 30 minutes before), mix all of the marinade ingredients in a heavy-duty zipper baggie and add chicken. Put it in the fridge to marinate.\n2.  **Sauté the chicken:** When ready to begin, heat a large skillet with oil over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add chicken in batches so you don’t crowd the pan. Cook for about three to five minutes, or until it is brown on each side. Set it aside on a plate and cover with foil.\n3.  **Make the sauce:** Now, add the butter to the pan and let it melt before adding the garlic, onion, and ginger. Continue to stir and cook for two minutes. Add the paprika, sugar, red chili powder, garam masala, and cumin, and cook for another minute.\n4.  **Transfer to the pot:** Next, pour the sauce into your slow cooker and stir in the chicken. Add the evaporated milk and tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste.\n5.  **Cook the chicken:** Turn your pot to low and cook for six to seven hours or on high for three to four hours. About 30 minutes before the cooking time is up, stir in the heavy cream.\n6.  **Serve:** Finally, serve your butter chicken with whatever side dishes you like.\n\nExpert tip\n----------\n\n### Finding your own garam masala\n\nBecause there are many different garam masala blends, it is good to find your favorite before you cook with it. The most common variety is made with black peppercorns, green and black cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and mace. Some other types have fennel seeds, bay leaves, coriander, and chili powder. Others have only pepper, cloves, cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom.\n\nAll varieties and blends of garam masala are considered authentic Indian spices, so it is up to you to decide which mixture you prefer. Kosher garam masala has organic pepper, coriander, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom. Each spice, such as cardamom and fennel, can be ground into a powder or left as whole seeds or pods.\n\nBiryani masala is another variety of spices made with caraway seeds and anise. Another kind you may see on the market is chaat masala, which has dried mango powder added for a bit of sweet tanginess. You can also make your own, so you only get the spices you like and the right amounts.\n\n![slow cooker butter chicken served with rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals5-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nRecipe variations and add-ins:\n------------------------------\n\n*   **Different cuts:** Instead of skinless boneless chicken breast, you could also use thighs. Dark meat has a more robust flavor and is always juicy.\n*   **Different meat:** If your butcher does not have fresh organic chicken, you could use a different meat. I have tried pork, turkey. They are all truly delicious in their way.\n*   **Cheesy butter chicken:** Another way to change this recipe is to add some shredded cheese. I have tried cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.\n*   **Make it spicy:** Even with the garam masala and chili powder, this dish is not that spicy. If you want to add some heat, add red pepper flakes to the marinade and toss chopped jalapenos into the sauce.\n\nServing suggestions:\n--------------------\n\nSlow-cooker butter chicken goes great with all sorts of side dishes. Here are some ideas my family loves:\n\n*   To make this a whole meal in one pot, add some baby red potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.\n*   I like to serve my saucy butter chicken on top of some [perfect fluffy rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/how-to-cook-perfect-rice-in-the-instant-pot/) and garlic naan on the side.\n*   Any kind of side dish would pair nicely with this dish, but for an Indian theme, try it with chutney, chana masala, naan, or [grilled eggplant](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-eggplant-recipe/).\n*   Add a light salad on the side, like this [strawberry broccoli salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/strawberry-broccoli-salad-recipe/) or [grilled zucchini salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-zucchini-salad-recipe/).\n*   To help soak that delicious sauce, serve with some crusty French bread or rolls like my [Amish potato dinner rolls](https://urls.grow.me/https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/amish-potato-dinner-rolls-recipe/%23growSource=search&growReferrer=true).\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Why is my slow cooker butter chicken watery?\n\nFirst, the most common reason for watery butter chicken is too much liquid. That may be the obvious thing, but many people overlook it. Keep an eye on your measuring to make sure the amounts are all correct. Another problem could be that you added the cream and butter too soon. Try waiting for the sauce to cool before adding them. Thicken up your sauce with a bit of cornstarch slurry.\n\n### How long do I cook chicken in a slow cooker?\n\nThe time to cook chicken in a slow cooker depends on the cut of meat and how large it is. If you are cooking a whole chicken, you may have to let it cook for six hours on low or up to nine hours on high. Chicken breasts can be finished in six or seven hours on low or three to four on high. Chopped chicken, like in this dish, can cook even faster, so make sure you check the internal temp early. Once it reaches 160 degrees F, you can shut off the crockpot, which will continue to cook, reaching 165 degrees F quickly.\n\n### How do I make my butter chicken tender?\n\nNo chicken should be chewy or rubbery, but it happens sometimes. It can happen if your chicken was not cooked long enough or when it is cooked too long. You have to get it to the correct temperature for eating, which is 165 degrees F, without going over that number. Using the marinade in this recipe should keep your chicken from drying out, especially since you are cooking it low and slow in a creamy sauce.\n\n### Why did my butter chicken sauce crack?\n\nGetting the sauce perfect can be difficult if you do not follow the directions carefully. If you overcook it after adding the butter, it will separate. If it simmers too long, the water can evaporate, and the sauce will dry and crack. Another thing to be careful of is to add the yogurt while it is not too hot, or it will curdle. The same goes for the cream. Do not mix the cream in until the last step so it will blend seamlessly. \n\n![crockpot butter chicken with a wooden spoon into the mixture](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals2-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nHow to store:\n-------------\n\n*   **Refrigerate:** After cooled to room temperature, put your crockpot butter chicken in a sealed container. It will stay fresh for up to 10 days. \n*   **Freezing:** If you want to keep it longer, you must freeze it. Once it has cooled, pour it into a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, and it can stay frozen for four to six months. \n*   **Defrost:** Remove your frozen leftovers from the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you plan to serve them.\n*   **Reheating:** Heat in a saucepan on the stove for 10 minutes or in the microwave for one or two minutes. \n\nRecipe tips:\n------------\n\n*   To easily remove cardamom pods after cooking, use a needle and thread to tie them together. Then, before serving, lift the thread out to remove all the pods at once.\n*   If your chicken is too thin, add some cornstarch slurry and heat it a little longer. You can make a slurry by mixing one tablespoon of cornstarch with one cup of warm water.\n*   If it has an acid taste, add another tablespoon of sugar or honey.\n*   I usually double the sauce recipe because I like to use it when reheating. It also tastes great on tacos, pasta, and bread.\n*   When freezing, put your leftovers in small freezer-safe containers to take out just what you need when you need it.\n\nSlow Cooker Butter Chicken is made with tender, perfectly seasoned chicken and a rich curry sauce made with tomato and cream.

I’ve been eating these things separately or in other dishes, but finally decided to throw them all together for a tasty meal-sized salad.\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples. A fork of on the plate and a dish towel to the side.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fall-harvest-salad-updated.jpg)\n\nHearty fall salads are seriously the best! In this Quinoa Spinach Salad, the [roasted butternut squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/web-stories/how-to-make-roasted-butternut-squash/) makes it sweet and satisfying, while the apple and pepitas add a nice crunch. Quinoa adds some staying power and the spinach nourishes the body in a way that no other food (besides other leafy greens) can. If you like my [garlicky kale salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/garlicky-kale/), you’ll love this one because the dressing is almost exactly the same – I just added a little maple syrup to sweeten it up a bit. And if you enjoy this salad, you should also check out my full roundup of [quinoa salad recipes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/easy-quinoa-salad/).\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad.jpg)\n\nHealth Benefits of Quinoa\n-------------------------\n\nI love using quinoa as a base for salads. It’s naturally gluten-free, high in protein and one of few plant foods that contain all nine essential amino acids ([source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-quinoa)). Not only that, but it’s also high in fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin E and various beneficial antioxidants! Talk about a powerhouse ingredient!\n\nUnfamiliar with making quinoa? I’ve got a great guide on [how to cook quinoa](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/) and it’s loaded with information about this little seed too.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being fully mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-2.jpg)\n\nHere’s What You Need\n--------------------\n\n*   **baby spinach** and **quinoa** – the base of this [meal-sized salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-build-a-healthy-salad/). You’ll need 1 1/2 cups of cooked quinoa which is 1/2 cup dry quinoa.\n*   **butternut squash** – cut the squash into uniform, bite-size pieces so they roast evenly.\n*   **apple** –  I prefer to use Honeycrisp, Pink Lady or Fuji apples, but any variety will work. Uniform, bite sized pieces are ideal here too so you can get a bite with all the flavors together!\n*   **pepitas** – pepitas are pumpkin seeds without the shell, but if you can’t find them you can use regular pumpkin seeds or even pecans for a nice added crunch. Roast them alongside the butternut squash for a roasted flavor boost.\n*   **dried cranberries** – I love adding dried fruit to my salads for a little touch of sweetness and texture. Raisins would also be great in this recipe.\n*   **tahini apple cider vinegar dressing** – tahini, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, tamari, nutritional yeast, garlic and a touch of maple syrup make up this delicious salad dressing.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest salad in a glass bowl being tossed with the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-3.jpg)\n\nSteps to Build This Salad\n-------------------------\n\n**Prep butternut squash** – Prepare the squash by peeling it, cutting it in half and scraping out the seeds, then cut the squash into bite-size cubes. You can also buy pre-cut butternut squash to skip this step! Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and roast at 400°F for 30-40 minutes, turning once or twice, until all the pieces are tender and have a few small brown spots.\n\n**Roast pepitas** – If your pepitas or pecans are raw, you can toast them in the oven with the roasting squash. Spread seeds/nuts on a separate baking sheet and add to the oven with the butternut squash for 5 to 10 minutes or until the seeds/nuts are golden and crunchy, then remove from the pan to cool. Be sure to watch the seeds/nuts carefully because they can burn quickly. The pepitas will take less time to toast than the pecans because they’re smaller.\n\n**Assemble salad** – While roasting the squash, toss together spinach, cooked quinoa, apple and cranberries in a large salad bowl. Add cooled pepitas (or pecans) once they’ve been toasted. Once the butternut squash is done roasting, allow it to cool and then place into the salad bowl with the other ingredients.\n\n**Make dressing** – While while butternut squash is roasting, prepare the dressing by placing all remaining ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n**Serve** – Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.\n\n![Tossed fall harvest spinach salad in a glass bowl with wooden spoons.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nSwitch it up!\n-------------\n\nYou can easily swap some of the ingredients in this salad and get an entirely different meal that will be equally delicious!\n\n*   **Baby spinach** – use another dark, leafy green like kale or collard greens. Arugula is a great salad base as well.\n*   **Butternut squash** – try [roasted sweet potatoes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/coconut-oil-roasted-sweet-potatoes/) instead, or even [cinnamon maple roasted Kabocha Squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-roasted-kabocha-squash/).\n*   **Apple** – instead of apple, you could use pears or even [jicama](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/jicama-nutrition-benefits).\n*   **Pepitas** – as mentioned above, you can also use pumpkin seeds or pecans. The idea here is to add some crunch so any kind of nut or seed will do!\n*   **Dried cranberries** – raisins or dried cherries would also be tasty!\n\nHow to Serve Fall Quinoa Spinach Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nFor me, this is a meal-sized salad I would eat on its own. But it would also make a great side salad if you want to serve it to more people! Here are some great ideas to serve alongside this salad:\n\n*   [Apple Cider Vinegar Chicken](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/apple-cider-vinegar-chicken/)\n*   [Pumpkin Spice Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/pumpkin-spice-salmon/)\n*   [Eggplant Casserole with Ground Turkey](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/eggplant-casserole/)\n*   [Maple Glazed Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-soy-broiled-salmon/)\n*   [Butternut Squash Soup](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/butternut-squash-soup/)\n*   [Healthy Turkey Chili](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/turkey-chili/)\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples.

But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like.

    "markdown": "# Fajita Veggies (Chipotle Inspired) - It's a Veg World After All®\n_Learn how to make delicious homemade fajita veggies, inspired by the sautéed peppers and onions at Chipotle restaurant. These colorful vegetables are a key ingredient in fajitas but can be used in a variety of other ways!_\n\n![cooked fajita veggies in a cast iron skillet next to a spoon and napkin](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-4.jpg)\n\n_This post may contain affiliate links. For more information, see my [affiliate disclosure](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/privacy-policy/)._\n\nIn my college years, I absolutely LOVED Chipotle. When a new one popped up a mile down the road from my childhood house, my younger brother and I were frequent visitors when we were home for the summer. We sometimes went twice a week!\n\nI usually ordered a burrito bowl or tacos, but regardless of my order, I always made sure it had fajita veggies! If you’re not familiar with these veggies, they’re perfectly tender, slightly charred, and have the best Mexican seasoning.\n\nSeeing how much I love Chipotle’s vegetables, it’s only right that I devote a post to homemade fajita veggies. They’re very fitting for the Veg World, after all. Plus, since I no longer live close to a Chipotle, I need to get my fix somehow!\n\nIn this recipe, I use red, orange, and green bell [peppers](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/category/peppers/), red [onion](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/category/onions/), and a simple fajita seasoning made from oregano, salt, and cumin. Then I cook the veggies in a cast iron skillet to get the same texture and charring that you see at Chipotle and other Mexican restaurants. They turned out great IMO!\n\n![three bell peppers, a red onion, and a dish with seasonings on a counter](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-1.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Fajita Veggies\n--------------------------\n\n*   **How to cut bell peppers and onions for fajitas.** First, remove the stems and seeds from the peppers. Slice them in half, then cut them into thin strips. For the onion, remove the skin and ends. Slice it in half, then cut the halves into thin, half-moon pieces.\n*   **Cook the fajita veggies in hot oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.** For firmer veggies, cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. I prefer to cook the veggies for 10 to 15 minutes so that they’re softer and more charred. Add the seasonings in the beginning and sprinkle with salt throughout the cooking process.\n\nOnce the veggies are cooked to your liking, serve them with tortillas, other fajita fillings (like chicken, beef, or beans), and an assortment of your favorite toppings (like sour cream, guac, or cheese).\n\n*   ![thinly sliced red and orange bell peppers on a cutting board with a chef's knife](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-2.jpg)\n    \n*   ![sliced peppers and onions dusted with seasonings in a large cast iron skillet](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-3.jpg)\n    \n\nExpert Tips\n-----------\n\n*   **Any kind of bell peppers will work for this recipe**, but I prefer to use a variety of colors! For an extra kick, consider adding some sliced [jalapenos](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/category/jalapenos/).\n*   **For best results, use a large [cast iron skillet](https://amzn.to/3fbrddI)**. The skillet will be exceptionally full when you add the veggies, but they will cook down. Stir the veggies occasionally with a wooden spoon, and scrape up any charred bits that stick to the pan.\n*   **What to do with leftover fajita veggies.** Add them to salads, eggs, and bowls (like my [Healthy Chicken Fajita Bowl](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/healthy-chicken-fajita-bowl/)!!!). They will last for 3 to 5 days in an airtight container in the fridge.\n\n![close shot of fajita peppers and onions in a cast iron skillet](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-5.jpg)\n\nMore Mexican-Inspired Vegetable Dishes\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   [Spinach Basil Pesto Quesadillas](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/pesto-quesadillas/)\n*   [Veggie-Loaded Slow Cooker Mexican Shredded Chicken](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/veggie-slow-cooker-mexican-chicken/)\n*   [Ancho Chile Sweet Potato Black Bean Tacos](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/black-bean-sweet-potato-tacos/)\n*   [Double Pepper Mango Salsa](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/double-pepper-mango-salsa/)\n*   [Loaded Radish Chip Nachos](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/loaded-radish-chip-nachos/)\n*   [Spaghetti Squash Burrito Bowls](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/spaghetti-squash-burrito-bowls/)\n*   [Radish and Black Bean Tacos with Avocado Crema](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/radish-and-black-bean-tacos/)\n*   [Healthy Creamy Jalapeno Sauce](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/healthy-creamy-jalapeno-sauce/)\n\n**I’d love to hear how you like this recipe!

Add the peppers and onions, sprinkle with the oregano, cumin, and salt, and stir. The skillet will be very full at first, but the veggies will cook down over time.\n    \n*   Cook until the veggies are tender and slightly charred, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon and scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the skillet. For firmer veggies, cook for ~7 minutes. For softer and more charred veggies, cook for 10 to 15 minutes (or longer). Season with more salt as desired.\n    \n*   Remove from heat and serve in fajitas, tacos, or burritos.\n    \n\n*   To make this recipe spicier, add sliced jalapenos.\n*   Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 5 days. You can eat them cold, or you can reheat them in the microwave on high for 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nServing: 1serving | Calories: 89kcal | Carbohydrates: 5g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 7g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 100mg | Potassium: 152mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 1863IU | Vitamin C: 77mg | Calcium: 8mg | Iron: 1mg\n\n_Enjoy! – Lizzie_\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

This healthy salad is make ahead friendly for quick lunches.

When it comes to [healthy dinners](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/category/main-dish/30-minute-dinners/), I have tons of favorite easy recipes to rely on. I’m also always sure to make a healthy breakfast, usually either [overnight oats](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/strawberry-chia-overnight-oats/), eggs and toast, or these [Healthy Greek Yogurt Pancakes](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/lemon-greek-yogurt-pancakes/).\n\nBut when it comes to lunch, I never quite have a plan and we usually end up eating a sandwich or quesadilla. I thought about my [Healthy Broccoli Salad](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/no-mayo-broccoli-salad-blueberries-apple/) or [Tabouli](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/tabouli-salad/). Some days (like today) I plan ahead and chop some veggies to eat with our favorite [white bean dip](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/easy-white-bean-dip/), but more often than I care to admit I eat a boring peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.\n\n![Kale Salad ingredients in white bowl including avocado, quinoa, blueberries, almonds and goat cheese. ](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kale-superfood-salad-1200-7521.jpg?resize=600%2C900&ssl=1 \"This Kale Salad with Quinoa, Blueberries and Avocado is loaded with super foods! This healthy salad is make ahead friendly for quick lunches. Goat cheese, avocado, and a honey lemon dressing bring lots of flavor to this gluten free power salad! kristineskitchenblog.com\")\n\nThe key, I’ve discovered, is to prep make ahead lunches that we can then enjoy throughout the week. The middle of the day is a super busy time when I’m at home with the kids, so lunch has to come together FAST. On work and school days, the best options are those that are ready to grab and go, like leftovers or make ahead salads.\n\nYou can make the quinoa ahead of time by following my [How to Cook Quinoa guide.](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/)\n\nLast week was my first week of summer break from teaching, so I promised myself I was going to get creative in the kitchen and make us a salad that Brad and I could enjoy for a few days’ worth of lunches. I knew I wanted it to have quinoa and blueberries in it. Then I decided it had to have avocado. And almonds.\n\nWe had lots of kale washed and ready to go in our refrigerator since I had just recorded the video for [how to wash kale](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/how-to-wash-and-store-kale-for-smoothies-and-salads/). The salad was already packed with superfoods, and healthy kale was the perfect thing to power it up even more!\n\n![close up of kale salad ingredients in bowl](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kale-superfood-salad-1200-7540.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&ssl=1 \"This Kale Salad with Quinoa, Blueberries and Avocado is loaded with super foods!

The quinoa provides a good amount of protein as well. I’m listing the chickpeas as optional in the ingredient list, as this salad is delicious both with and without them.\n\nYou can make this Kale Quinoa Salad with Blueberries ahead of time for grab and go work lunches. I recommend waiting to add the avocado and almonds right before serving, to keep the avocado fresh and the almonds crunchy.\n\n![tossed kale quinoa salad with avocado, blueberries, goat cheese and almonds](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kale-superfood-salad-1200-7578.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&ssl=1 \"This Kale Salad with Quinoa, Blueberries and Avocado is loaded with super foods!

Goat cheese, avocado, and a honey lemon dressing bring lots of flavor to this gluten free power salad! kristineskitchenblog.com\")\n\nWhy we love this kale quinoa salad:\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   This kale quinoa salad is loaded with healthy ingredients! Kale is low in calories, high in fiber, and has nearly 3 grams of protein per cup. Blueberries have one of the highest levels of antioxidants among all foods. Quinoa is naturally gluten free and a good source of protein and fiber.\n*   With all of the flavors and textures going on here, this salad is anything but boring! We especially love the creamy goat cheese with the quinoa and kale!\n*   It lasts in the refrigerator for 3 days, so you can make a big batch for a few days’ worth of lunches.\n\nAlso try my classic [kale salad](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/massaged-kale-salad-with-pepitas-cranberries-and-goat-cheese/)!\n\nMore Quinoa Recipes:\n--------------------\n\n*   [Instant Pot Quinoa](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/instant-pot-quinoa/)\n*   [Quinoa Stuffed Peppers](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/quinoa-stuffed-peppers/)\n*   [Quinoa and Mushrooms](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/balsamic-garlic-roasted-mushrooms-quinoa/)\n*   [Quinoa Lunch Bowls](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/quinoa-and-roasted-broccoli-lunch-bowls/)\n*   [Spinach and Quinoa Salad](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/spinach-and-quinoa-salad-with-apple-and-pecans/)\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kale-superfood-salad-1200-7584-1.jpg?fit=133%2C200&ssl=1)\n\nKale Quinoa Salad with Blueberries\n----------------------------------\n\nThis Kale Quinoa Salad with Blueberries packs a nutritional punch! Quinoa, blueberries, and avocado bring lots of flavor to this healthy make ahead lunch.\n\n#### For the Salad:\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup quinoa\n*   ▢ 6 cups kale, 1 large bunch with tough stems removed and chopped ([see my easy method for prepping kale!](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/how-to-wash-and-store-kale-for-smoothies-and-salads/))\n*   ▢ 15 ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained (optional)\n*   ▢ 1 cup blueberries\n*   ▢ 4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\n*   ▢ ½ cup sliced almonds\n*   ▢ 1 avocado, peeled, pitted, and chopped\n\n#### For the Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil\n*   ▢ ¼ cup lemon juice\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons honey\n*   ▢ 1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard\n*   ▢ ¼ teaspoon Kosher salt\n*   ▢ a bit of black pepper\n\n*   Rinse and drain the quinoa. Place quinoa and 2 cups water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook for about 15 minutes until water is absorbed. Transfer to a large bowl to cool.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, make the dressing. Whisk together all dressing ingredients in a large salad bowl. Add the kale and, using your hands, toss it with the dressing.\n    \n*   Once the quinoa is cool, add it to the bowl with the kale, along with the chickpeas (if using), blueberries, goat cheese, almonds, and avocado. Toss gently to combine. Serve.\n    \n\nMake Ahead Instructions: Salad will last for 3 days in the refrigerator, making it a great option for make-ahead lunches. I like to store the almonds and avocado separately, and add them right before serving.\n\nServing: 1/4 salad, Calories: 734kcal, Carbohydrates: 74g, Protein: 26g, Fat: 42g, Saturated Fat: 8g, Trans Fat: 1g, Cholesterol: 13mg, Sodium: 612mg, Potassium: 1315mg, Fiber: 14g, Sugar: 14g, Vitamin A: 10450IU, Vitamin C: 135mg, Calcium: 306mg, Iron: 6mg\n\nNutrition information is an estimate.\n\nThis site contains affiliate links.

    "markdown": "# Butter Cauliflower - Dishing Out Health\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_This Butter Cauliflower Recipe is a vegetarian riff on the classic Indian dish, Butter Chicken. In this version, tender cauliflower florets are simmered in a spiced cream sauce and served over rice with yogurt. A cozy weeknight dinner the whole family will love._ ![Vegetarian Butter Cauliflower recipe served over basmati rice with yogurt and naan](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower3.jpg)\n\nThe Best Butter Cauliflower Recipe:\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt’s official, cauliflower has hit its peak. In this Butter Cauliflower recipe, the versatile veggie takes on bright, vibrant flavors, and creates the heartiest homemade version of a classic. Serve it over rice, quinoa, or your grain of choice for a gluten free, vegetarian bowl of BLISS.\n\nIn its purest form, Butter Chicken consists of chunks of chicken marinated in a yogurt-and-spice mixture. The chicken gets simmered in a luxuriously creamy sauce comprising tomatoes, aromatics, a wealth of spices, and butter. This dish differs from Tikka Masala in that its more creamy than spicy, however Butter Chicken can still pack a fiery punch.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite Indian dishes because it truly has the power to warm you from the inside out. It’s also incredibly versatile, and you’ll notice most versions has varying ratios of spice.\n\nButter Cauliflower is best served with a side of naan to sop up any remaining sauce. It also makes the BEST leftovers once the flavors really have a chance to develop and marry. In short, it’s the kind of dish I could eat on repeat and never tire of.![Cauliflower florets simmered in a spiced curry sauce with cream and cilantro](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower2.jpg)![A vegetarian version of Butter Chicken made with cauliflower](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower6.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Butter Chicken Vegetarian:\n--------------------------------------\n\nCauliflower is one of the best plant-based subs for chicken in this recipe. However, in order to achieve the meatiest texture, the cauliflower requires a couple extra steps.\n\n*   First, sear the cauliflower florets in a skillet until slightly softened.\n*   Next, toss them in a corn starch, lemon juice, and spice mixture. Since classic Butter Chicken is marinaded in yogurt and spices, this step mimics the same acid + spice infusion. The corn starch will also help create a crust on the cauli, helping it retain its texture after being simmered in the sauce.\n\nAs far as spices, the classic lineup includes garam masala, ginger, cumin, fenugreek, and chiles. Some versions may also call for coriander, cardamom, turmeric, and paprika.\n\nIn addition, Butter Chicken always calls for butter, tomatoes, and cream, which compose the base of the sauce. In this version, I try to keep the spices relatively streamlined (turmeric, cumin, paprika, ginger, etc.), however garam masala is a must!\n\nIncase you’re not familiar, garam masala is a super fragrant spice blend that includes many of the above mentioned ingredinets. The main difference between garam masala and curry powder is that it does not include turmeric. For this reason, garam masala tends to taste a bit sweeter, more floral, and less earthy.![Crispy cauliflower florets marinaded and pan-seared](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower.jpg)![A vegetarian version of Butter Chicken using cauliflower](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower4.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with Butter Cauliflower:\n--------------------------------------\n\nI love serving this dish over basmati rice with a side of naan. However if you’re looking to add some protein, I recommend serving it over quinoa or tossing in some chickpeas.\n\nSwirling in a dollop of Greek yogurt at the end also ups the protein ante. Plus, it makes the sauce even creamier and balances the spice. This recipe is quite filling on its own between the fiber and satiating fats, though feel free to adjust and make it your own!\n\nTo finish off, add some fresh cilantro sprigs and a spritz of lemon juice!\n\nAnd, as always, if you give this recipe a try, be sure to tag #dishingouthealth so I can see your beautiful creations!\n\nOther Healthy Cauliflower Recipes to Try:\n-----------------------------------------\n\n#### [BBQ Cauliflower Tacos with Green Tahini Sauce](https://dishingouthealth.com/bbq-cauliflower-tacos-with-green-tahini-sauce/)\n\n#### [Cauliflower Burrito Bowls with Jalapeño Ranch](https://dishingouthealth.com/cauliflower-burrito-bowls-with-jalapeno-ranch/)\n\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice\n*   ▢ 2 tsp. corn starch\n*   ▢ 1/2 tsp. ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 tsp. ground turmeric divided\n*   ▢ 3 tsp. garam masala divided\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tsp. salt divided\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. olive oil divided\n*   ▢ 1 medium head of cauliflower cut into florets\n*   ▢ 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter\n*   ▢ 1 yellow onion finely chopped\n*   ▢ 3 garlic cloves minced\n*   ▢ 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger sub ground ginger\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. tomato paste\n*   ▢ 1 tsp. paprika\n*   ▢ 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ Pinch of cayenne pepper optional\n*   ▢ 1 8-oz. can tomato sauce\n*   ▢ 2 cups vegetable broth\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup heavy cream sub full-fat canned coconut milk\n*   ▢ Basmati rice for serving\n*   ▢ Fresh cilantro and whole-milk Greek yogurt for garnish\n\n*   Combine lemon juice, corn starch, cumin, and 1/2 tsp each of turmeric, garam masala, and salt in a large bowl.

    "markdown": "# Peach Salad {With Basil & Spinach} - FeelGoodFoodie\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/privacy-policy/).\n\nPeaches are one of my favorite fruits this time of year and this peach salad is the perfect way to enjoy this juicy stone fruit. Finished with a sweet and tangy olive oil dressing, it’s super quick and easy to make and impressive to serve!\n\n![Large bowl of summer peach salad with spinach and avocado with large serving spoon inside](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Peach-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nIngredients for making peach salad\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **Peaches:** Peaches not only add an amazing color and sweetness to this salad, but they are loaded with nutrients and antioxidants. They are a great source of vitamins A and C as well as iron and folate. Get my top tips for [cutting peaches](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/how-to-cut-a-peach/).\n*   **Spinach:** I like to use baby spinach for the base of this salad, but lots of other greens will work well. Arugula, romaine or butter lettuce will all make nice additions.\n*   **Avocado:** Sliced avocado adda a lovely creamy texture as well as being a great source of healthy fatty acids.\n*   **Feta:** This Greek cheese adds a nice slight saltiness to help balance out the other ingredients.\n*   **Pecans:** I like to add pecans to the salad to add texture. Walnuts or almonds would also work well.\n*   **Basil leaves:** Basil and peaches work so well together and they add a nice herby freshness.\n*   **Dressing:** Olive oil, red wine vinegar, honey, salt and pepper.\n\n![Ingredients to make the recipe](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Peach-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nMaking the salad\n----------------\n\nTo assemble the salad, I recommend laying the spinach or greens in a large bowl first, adding the peaches, then drizzling the dressing and finally, adding the toppings. You can toss the salad, but the presentation of it is much better un-tossed.\n\n![Large bowl of spinach and peaches with avocados, basil, pecans, feta cheese and dressing on the side](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Peach-Salad-2.jpg)\n\nTips for making a peach salad\n-----------------------------\n\n1.  **Use perfectly ripe peaches for the best flavor.** Squeeze the peaches, gently but firmly, if they give a little they are good to use.\n2.  **Wash and dry your greens well.** If you have one, use a salad spinner to get rid of excess water or pat the leaves dry with kitchen paper. Excess moisture will pool in the bottom of the bowl and you will get a soggy salad.\n3.  **Make this dish vegan.** Simply swap the honey in the dressing for maple syrup and skip the feta cheese.\n4.  **Make extra salad dressing.** The sweet red wine vinaigrette will work well with all of your favorite salads and will keep well for up to 7 days, so you can use it throughout the week.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can you make this salad ahead of time?**\n\nThis salad is best served as soon as it is made as the dressing will start to wilt the spinach leaves. If you like, you can build the salad the day before and keep it covered in the fridge. Add the dressing just before serving.\n\n**What else can you add to this salad?**\n\nThis salad is a great side dish, but it’s really easy to turn it into a full meal.

Fast to prepare and perfect for a quick summer side dish._\n\n![Juicy fresh peaches and all the caprese salad fixins' come together in this summery peach caprese salad! Fast to prepare and perfect for a quick summer side dish.](https://wholeandheavenlyoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peach-Caprese-Salad-Center-Bowl.jpg)\n\nIt’s salads like this that make a person wish summer would just last forever!\n\nWe’re taking a summer staple, caprese and marrying it with the crown jewel of summer fruit, aka peaches.\n\nThe result is one summer-packed salad that somehow tastes even better than it looks and is destined to become your go-to this summer.\n\n![Juicy fresh peaches and all the caprese salad fixins' come together in this summery peach caprese salad! Fast to prepare and perfect for a quick summer side dish.](https://wholeandheavenlyoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peach-Caprese-Salad-Overhead.jpg)\n\nWe’re taking a few twists and turns from classic caprese with the addition of peaches, spring greens and toasted almonds, but I guarantee you won’t mind!\n\nThis salad is light, yet satisfying and just brimming with all the best parts of summer.\n\n### This Peach Caprese Salad features…\n\n*   Sweet summer **peaches** and **tomatoes**\n*   Rich **mozzarella pearls**\n*   Crisp **spring greens and toasted almonds**\n*   A tangy **balsamic dressing**\n\n![Juicy fresh peaches and all the caprese salad fixins' come together in this summery peach caprese salad! Fast to prepare and perfect for a quick summer side dish.](https://wholeandheavenlyoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peach-Caprese-Salad-Dressing.jpg)\n\nMaking the Peach Caprese Salad\n------------------------------\n\n_(scroll down to the bottom of post for the full recipe)_\n\n### Ingredients You Will Need\n\n*   **Peaches**\n*   **Tomatoes**\n*   **Fresh mozzarella**\n*   **Spring green mix**\n*   **Sliced almonds**\n*   **Basil**\n*   **Balsamic vinegar**\n*   **Honey**\n*   **Dijon mustard**\n*   **Olive oil**\n\n### Choosing Your Fruit\n\nWe recommend using ripe, yet just slightly firm peaches and tomatoes for this salad. Ideally, you want the fruit ripe enough to where it’s sweet, but not so ripe that it’s mushy once cut.\n\nThis salad is especially good with in-season peaches and tomatoes if you have access to them!\n\n![Juicy fresh peaches and all the caprese salad fixins' come together in this summery peach caprese salad! Fast to prepare and perfect for a quick summer side dish.](https://wholeandheavenlyoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peach-Caprese-Salad-Closeup.jpg)\n\n### Tips for Perfect Peach Caprese Salad\n\n1.  **Toss peaches with a bit of lemon juice if storing –** do this if you plan to store the salad in the fridge for awhile before serving. The acidity from the lemon juice keeps the peaches from browning.\n2.  **Toast almonds –** this adds a lot of flavor and gives the nuts a perfect crunch.\n3.  **Add basil and almonds just before serving –** basil is best if used immediately after it’s been cut, as it tends to turn brown and lose freshness.\n4.  **Dress salad just before serving –** this will keep the greens perfectly crisp.\n\n### Recipe Variations\n\nThis recipe is easy to adapt into something new! Try these ideas…\n\n*   **Choose another green –** try spinach, romaine, or another fresh green in place of the spring mix.\n*   **Try another fruit –** fresh cherries, nectarines, peaches, or strawberries would be delicious in place of the peaches.\n*   **Swap out the cheese –** try regular sliced fresh mozzarella, feta, or burrata.\n*   **Skip the nuts –** simply omit the almonds to make this a nut-free salad.\n\n### Storing the Salad\n\nIf you plan to store this salad, store it separately from the dressing, basil, and toasted almonds. Assemble only just before serving.\n\nThe salad will keep in the fridge about 4 days and the dressing will keep about 1 week.\n\n![Juicy fresh peaches and all the caprese salad fixins' come together in this summery peach caprese salad! Fast to prepare and perfect for a quick summer side dish.](https://wholeandheavenlyoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peach-Caprese-Salad-Closeup-Middle.jpg)\n\nThe sweet, juicy peaches really do steal the show in this incredible twist on caprese salad!

It should be dull. If it's shiny, it's probably overripe.\n*   Choose one that has no soft spots or signs of damage.\n*   The melon should be fairly heavy for its size.\n*   Most importantly, find the end where it was joined to the vine and have a sniff.

    "markdown": "# Spinach Salad with Pears, Pecans and Goat Cheese\nWho says salads have to be boring? This spinach salad with pears, pecans and goat cheese is easy to make and delicious!\n\n![A beige bowl full of spinach pear salad.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-with-goat-cheese.jpg)\n\nThis spinach pear salad isn't exactly new or ground-breaking, but it's really delicious.\n\nEven back when I didn't really enjoying eating salads, I would happily eat this one. The combination of sweet baby spinach, crunchy toasted pecans and juicy pears works together so well, you might even be able to convert the salad haters in your life!\n\n![A beige bowl with baby spinach, slices of pear, crumbled goat cheese and pecan peices.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-with-pecans.jpg)\n\n🍐 Ingredients\n--------------\n\nThis recipe is simple, but packs a ton of flavour. Here's what I used in my salad.\n\n*   Baby Spinach\n*   Pears\n*   Pecans\n*   Goat Cheese\n\nFor the dressing, I wanted a balance of sweet and tangy flavours. To achieve that, I went with a balsamic and Dijon mustard vinaigrette. Feel free to use your favourite homemade or store-bought vinaigrette instead, though.\n\n🥬 Substitutions\n----------------\n\nWhile baby spinach works best in this recipe, you can also make it with flat-leaf (also known as smooth leaf) spinach. This is a sweet type of spinach that is best served raw, and it's usually what you'll find in bags at the grocery store.\n\nI would avoid using savoy spinach (the crinkly ones), as those can be bitter and benefit from being cooked.\n\nFor the pears, you have a few options. Bartletts, [the most-common pear worldwide](https://www.ontario.ca/foodland/food/pears), have a soft juicy texture that works well in this spinach salad. If you prefer a firmer texture, a Bosc or Green Anjou pear would be good options.\n\nYou can substitute walnuts, sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds for the pecans, and blue cheese or feta for the goat cheese.\n\n![An overhead view of a beige bowl of spinach pecan salad with pears and goat cheese.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad.jpg)\n\n🥗 Making the Salad\n-------------------\n\nThis salad is super easy to prepare, even if you toast your own pecans and make the vinaigrette from scratch.\n\nIf you opt to buy pre-washed baby spinach, pre-toasted nuts and a bottled vinaigrette, you're that much closer to eating!\n\nEssentially, once you've washed your produce, all that's left to do is slice your pears, chop your pecans, and crumble your cheese. Assemble, top with your dressing, and you're ready to eat!\n\nIt's important to note that you don't have to peel the pears if you don't want to. Not only does this save time, but [the skin is also a good source of fibre](https://usapears.org/fiber/). Just be sure to give your pears a good wash before cutting them up.\n\nIf the skin on your pears is very tough (which is sometimes the case when you buy them out of season) you can go ahead and peel them. I had to do that when I took the photos for this recipe.\n\nI hope you try making this salad, and if you do let me know what you think of it in the comments below!\n\n🖨 Printable Recipe\n-------------------\n\n![A beige bowl with baby spinach, slices of pear, crumbled goat cheese and pecans.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-featured-image-360x360.jpg)\n\nThis delicious spinach salad gets crunch from toasted pecans, creaminess from goat cheese and sweetness from juicy ripe pears!\n\nPREP TIME: 15 minutes\n\nTOTAL TIME: 15 minutes\n\nSERVINGS: 4 Servings\n\n[PRINT RECIPE](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wprm_print/spinach-pear-salad-with-pecans-and-goat-cheese) [SAVE RECIPE](https://app.grow.me/) [RATE RECIPE](#commentform)\n\n#### For the Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ ½ cup olive oil\n*   ▢ ¼ cup balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, optional (helps to emulsify the dressing)\n*   ▢ pinch of salt and pepper\n\n#### For the Salad:\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups baby spinach, washed and dried\n*   ▢ ½ cup pecans, toasted and chopped\n*   ▢ 2 large ripe pears, washed and sliced into wedges (peeling optional)\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup plain goat cheese, crumbled\n\n#### For the Dressing:\n\n*   Place all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until combined.

Serve immediately.\n    \n\nIf you don't want to make the salad dressing, you can try this recipe with your favourite store-bought vinaigrette, or a simple homemade oil and vinegar vinaigrette. \n\nSubstitutions:\n\n*   Use flat-leaf (or smooth-leaf) spinach instead of baby spinach.

Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again.\n\nWatch the Video\n---------------\n\n![Arugula Salad with Couscous Recipe Video](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Arugula-Salad-with-Couscous-Recipe-Video.jpg)\n\n**Related:** We love adding couscous to salads, here’s our [lemon and herb couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12689/lemon-and-herb-couscous-salad-recipe/) with tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\nOur Favorite Arugula Salad\n--------------------------\n\nIt’s funny how certain recipes sneak their way into your weekly rotation. This arugula and couscous salad has done just that. We make it for dinner, eat the leftovers for lunch, and have served it to friends more times than I can count.\n\nYou’ll be itching to make it again once you try this arugula salad recipe. The salad is **simple, fast, and tastes like it came from a fancy restaurant**. Here’s the rundown on how to make it:\n\n![Lemon Arugula and Couscous Salad with Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1-1200.jpg)\n\n**The base of our salad is couscous** — we particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous). It cooks quickly and **gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself**. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, barley, or other grains — farro is excellent in salads (see our [apple, arugula, and farro salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/43230/farro-salad-with-apples/) for inspiration).\n\nAdd crisp **cucumbers**, baby **arugula** (or other tender greens), and **feta** cheese to the couscous. The lemon vinaigrette is simple — just lemon juice, olive oil, and a little honey.\n\n**Tip:** Since the dressing is so simple, it’s easy to play with. If we have it on hand, we love throwing a tablespoon of minced preserved lemon to the party. You can buy it or make your own — we shared this [recipe for preserved lemon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/5543/olives-with-lemon-confit-and-chili-flakes/) a while back if you want to take a look.\n\n![Adding lemon vinaigrette to couscous for the arugula and couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arugula-Salad-Recipe-3-1200.jpg)\n\n**The real trick to this salad is assembling it:** toss most of the dressing with the warm couscous and let it cool slightly before adding other ingredients. We take the same approach when making potato salad (we toss warm potatoes with the dressing first). By doing this, the warm ingredient has a chance to absorb all the flavor in the dressing. A game changer.\n\nThe same idea applies if you swap the couscous for pasta or another grain. Toss the still-warm pasta/grain with the dressing first, let it absorb, and cool slightly. Then, move on to adding the rest of the ingredients.\n\n**This arugula salad would go really well next to** this [Seriously Good Turkey Burger](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/34790/seriously-good-turkey-burger/), our [Easy Lemon Garlic Baked Chicken Breasts](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28703/lemon-garlic-baked-chicken-breast-recipe/) and our [Perfectly Baked Salmon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/149/moms-oven-poached-salmon/) (inspired by my Mom).\n\n![Lemon Arugula Salad with Couscous, Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1200.jpg)\n\n**For more arugula recipes**, take a look at our [Fried Goat Cheese, Strawberry and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/648/fried-goat-cheese-arugula-salad/), our [Lemony White Bean and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/42176/white-bean-salad/), this lovely [Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad Recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12907/shaved-fennel-and-arugula-salad-recipe/) and these [Baked Chicken Thighs with Potatoes, Garlic and Arugula](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28824/baked-chicken-thighs-with-potatoes/).\n\nLemon Arugula Salad with Couscous and Feta\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   PREP 10mins\n*   COOK 10mins\n*   TOTAL 20mins\n\nOur arugula salad, made with an easy lemon vinaigrette, pearl couscous, cucumbers, and feta, is crave-worthy.

You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, or other cooked grains like barley or wheat berries.\n\nMakes 4 large servings\n\nWatch Us Make the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nYou Will Need\n-------------\n\nFor the Salad\n\n1 ½ cups dried pearl (Israeli) couscous, _about 3 cups cooked_\n\n3 ounces baby arugula or tender salad greens, _about 4 cups_\n\nHalf of a hothouse (seedless) cucumber, chopped\n\n2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled, _about 1/2 cup_\n\nFor the Dressing\n\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, _about 1/2 large lemon_\n\n4 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup\n\n1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon, _optional_\n\n1 teaspoon dried basil or a handful chopped fresh basil leaves, _optional_\n\nSea salt and fresh ground black pepper\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n1Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add couscous and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, then add to a large bowl.\n\n2Meanwhile, make the lemon vinaigrette. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, honey, preserved lemon, and basil until it looks thick and blended. Season to taste with salt and fresh ground black pepper (we add a generous pinch of each).\n\n3Toss the cooked and drained couscous with the dressing, then set aside for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly. Finish the salad by adding the arugula, cucumbers, and feta. Toss well, then serve.\n\nAdam and Joanne's Tips\n----------------------\n\n*   The salad will keep overnight in the fridge. As it sits, the greens may wilt slightly, but still will taste great.\n*   If you cannot find pearl (Israeli) couscous, substitute with a regular couscous, small pasta shape such as orzo or cooked grains like quinoa, wheat berries and barley.\n*   Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates. We have used the USDA database to calculate approximate values.

    "markdown": "# Lemon Orzo Salad with Chicken • Salt & Lavender\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://www.saltandlavender.com/privacy-policy/).\n\nThis **lemon orzo salad** recipe is a fresh, healthy, and colorful summer salad that’s a breeze to make! It’s ready in about 30 minutes.\n\nTry this [Easy Italian Pasta Salad](https://www.saltandlavender.com/easy-italian-pasta-salad-recipe/) for another quick summer salad recipe.\n\n![lemon orzo salad in a white bowl](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-1-720x1080.jpg)\n\nWhy you’ll love it\n------------------\n\nOrzo is extremely popular lately, so I’m thrilled to bring you even more recipes with it. You loved this [Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup](https://www.saltandlavender.com/lemon-chicken-orzo-soup/), so I’ve come up with this irresistible orzo salad with chicken and fresh vegetables and a **quick lemon honey vinaigrette** that’s simple to make.\n\nThis bright lemon orzo pasta salad is **easily customizable** and lends itself to substitutions or additions. My mantra has always been that summer recipes like salads should be fuss-free. Who wants to be in the kitchen for hours when you can be outside on the patio with a glass of prosecco?\n\nWhat you’ll need\n----------------\n\n_For the salad_\n\n*   **Orzo** – you’ll find this small rice-shaped pasta in the dry pasta aisle\n*   **Cucumbers** – I prefer using mini (Persian) cucumbers, but if you can’t find them, half a regular English one works just fine\n*   **Tomatoes** – use grape, cherry, or any little tomato variety\n*   **Onion** – red onion is the ideal kind for salads since it’s less sharp than other varieties and packs a crunch\n*   **Arugula** – for some green goodness, but it’s optional if you’d like this salad for meal prep\n*   **Chicken** – I just bought a rotisserie chicken for ease, but if you’ve got a leftover [Roast Chicken](https://www.saltandlavender.com/easy-roast-chicken/), that’s great too\n*   **Parmesan** – I can’t resist giving this pasta salad a little bit of a cheesy dimension\n*   **Basil** – fresh basil perfectly complements and enhances all the flavors\n\n_For the dressing_\n\n*   **Lemon** – we’re using both freshly squeezed lemon juice and the zest for ultimate brightness. I like to use my [Microplane](https://amzn.to/3OGHbPI) to effortlessly zest it.\n*   **Olive oil** – to balance out the acidity and add body\n*   **Honey** – for a hint of sweetness\n*   **Garlic** – use even more if you’re a big fan of garlic! I like to use [this garlic press](https://amzn.to/3I7oAJQ) to mince it since you don’t even need to peel the cloves.\n*   **Salt & pepper** – as with any pasta salad, it’s important to be generous\n\nMake ahead tip\n--------------\n\nIf you want to make this salad ahead of time or for meal prep, I suggest leaving out the arugula. That way, it’ll last in the fridge a few days no problem. Just mix in the arugula when you’re ready to enjoy it!\n\n![lemon orzo pasta salad with chicken in a glass prep bowl](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-3-720x1080.jpg)\n\nHow to make lemon orzo salad\n----------------------------\n\n_This is an overview, and full ingredients & instructions are in the recipe card below._\n\n*   Boil a salted pot of water, and cook the orzo al dente. Rinse with cool water, drain, and transfer the pasta to a large bowl.\n*   Prep and chop all the salad ingredients and add to the bowl.\n*   Add the dressing ingredients to a jar or small bowl and mix thoroughly. Toss the salad with the dressing, and enjoy!\n\nSubstitutions and variations\n----------------------------\n\n*   I used a rotisserie chicken for this recipe, but you can definitely quickly cook some chicken if you have some. Try pan frying it with your favorite seasoning, and it’ll be delicious.\n*   Need to make this vegetarian? Simply omit the chicken.\n*   Feel free to throw in any fresh herbs you may have in the garden!\n*   If you don’t like arugula, try swapping it for spinach.\n*   I think that Kalamata olives and/or capers would go great in here if you’re a fan.\n\nWhat to serve with orzo salad\n-----------------------------\n\n*   It makes a fantastic lighter main course, so it’s perfect on its own or with a slice of crusty bread.\n*   You can also leave out the chicken, and then it makes a perfect complement for seafood recipes such as my [Easy Pan Seared Salmon Recipe](https://www.saltandlavender.com/pan-seared-salmon/) or these [Tequila Lime Shrimp](https://www.saltandlavender.com/tequila-lime-shrimp/).\n\nLeftovers and storage\n---------------------\n\n*   As mentioned above, this orzo salad will keep in the fridge in an airtight container for 3-4 days no problem if you leave out the arugula.\n*   If this salad has been sitting out in the sun for any amount of time, I’d eat it right away or discard it for food safety reasons.\n\n![lemon orzo salad close-up](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-2-720x1080.jpg)\n\nAre you an orzo fan? Leave me a comment below if you have any questions or if you’ve made this orzo salad. As always, tag me #saltandlavender on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/saltandlavender) if you’ve made one of my recipes. 🙂\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup uncooked orzo\n*   ▢ 2 mini cucumbers (or 1/2 English cucumber) chopped\n*   ▢ 1 cup little tomatoes (grape/cherry/etc.) cut into quarters\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons red onion chopped\n*   ▢ 2 cups (loosely packed) fresh arugula optional\n*   ▢ 2 cups cooked/rotisserie chicken\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons fresh basil sliced thin\n\n#### Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ 1.5 tablespoons lemon juice + zest of 1 lemon\n*   ▢ 2.5 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon honey\n*   ▢ 1 clove garlic minced\n*   ▢ Salt & pepper to taste\n\n*   Boil a salted pot of water and cook the orzo al dente according to package directions. Once it's done, rinse it with cool water and let it drain thoroughly. Transfer to a large bowl.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, prep all the salad ingredients and add them to the bowl. If you're not going to eat the salad right away, I suggest skipping the arugula.\n    \n*   Add the dressing ingredients to a jar or small bowl, and whisk/shake until well combined.\n    \n*   Toss the salad with the dressing. Add more lemon/oil if needed. I also add plenty of salt & pepper – there's a lot of pasta in here, so you need to salt it well so it doesn't taste bland.\n    \n\n*   This recipe makes quite a lot of pasta salad. If served with nothing else, this could serve 4 adults. You can easily get 6+ servings out of this. If you know you’re going to have leftovers, I suggest either leaving out the arugula or only tossing it with the portion of the salad you’ll be eating right away. Without arugula, this salad will last in the fridge for a few days no problem.\n*   _Nutritional information is provided as a courtesy only and should be construed as an estimate rather than a guarantee.

It’s very easy and straightforward, and I also share tips and tricks on how to prevent them sticking to the grill.\n\n1.  **Preheat grill to medium-high heat:** Preheating is VERY important. If the grill grates are hot, the peaches will start developing grill marks immediately, which minimizes sticking. Oil the grates.\n2.  **Cut the peaches**, either into quarters or halves (remove the pit). **Brush** the flat side of the peaches, as well as the grill grates, with olive oil.\n3.  **Grill** cut-side down for 2 to 3 minutes UNDISTURBED per side. Removing them from the grill too early will cause them to stick.\n\n**How to Prevent Peaches from Sticking to Grill**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Find peaches that are ripe but also firm.** They need to be firm so they don’t get mushy, but also ripe for sweetness.\n*   **Size matters.** Bigger pieces of fruit work better. I’d recommend peach halves or quarters.\n*   Make sure the grill grates are **clean**.\n*   **Use medium-high heat.** This minimizes sticking to the grill. Brush the grill grates and peaches with **olive oil**.\n*   **Let them grill undisturbed** to get more defined grill marks. Check after 2-3 minutes and flip when ready.\n*   **Use a thin spatula:** It’s best to use a thin spatula to lift the peaches from underneath. Using tongs to flip peaches on the grill can sometimes rip the grill marks apart.\n*   **Outdoor grill, stovetop grill pan, or indoor electric grill:** I prefer cast iron, but if you’re worried about the fruit sticking to the grill, you can use a nonstick.\n\n![grilled peaches on mixed greens, berries, feta, and candied pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad2-min.jpg)\n\n**Ingredient Notes**\n--------------------\n\nGrilled peach salad is made with lots of great seasonal summer ingredients! Below I share a few ingredient notes from recipe testing. As always, the full ingredient quantity list can be found in the recipe card down below.\n\n**For the salad:**\n\n*   **Fresh peaches:** They should be ripe but firm. They need to be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but also relatively firm so that they don’t fall apart on the grill. The larger the peaches, the better.\n*   **Olive oil:** Brushing the peaches with olive oil helps prevent sticking.\n*   **Berries:** Use any fresh berries of your choice. Blackberries are my favorite for this recipe.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Choose a variety of mixed greens such as baby spinach, arugula, and romaine lettuce for texture.\n*   **Feta crumbles:** Adds fresh savory flavors. Other great choices are goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, and burrata cheese.\n\n**For the balsamic dressing:**\n\n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** For acidity and flavor.\n*   **Olive oil:** Use good extra virgin olive oil for better taste.\n*   **Minced garlic:** For flavor.\n*   **Honey:** To add sweetness and balance out the acidity.\n*   **Dijon mustard:** To help the vinegar and oil emulsify.\n*   **Salt and pepper** to taste\n\n![ingredients including water, salt, brown sugar, pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-balsamic-dressing-labeled.jpg)\n\n**For the Candied pecans:**\n\n**Brown sugar:** For sweetness. I use light brown sugar.  \n**Water:** To help the brown sugar melt and to thin it out.  \n**Pecan halves:** You can also use walnuts, if you prefer.  \n**A pinch of salt:** helps balance out the sweetness.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions**\n-----------------------------\n\nThis grilled peach salad takes about 20 minutes to make. Here’s a tutorial so you can see how easy it is!\n\n### **Step 1 | Make the candied pecans**\n\nIn a small skillet, melt the brown sugar with the water over medium-low heat. Add the pecan halves plus a pinch of salt. Stir to coat for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Want to spice them up? Add a little bit of ground cinnamon or cayenne pepper.\n\n![candied pecans in a small non-stick skillet](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/candied-pecans-for-salad-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 2 | Make the balsamic dressing**\n\nIn a mason jar, combine all the balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar and shake vigorously until emulsified or evenly combined.\n\n![prepared balsamic dressing in a mason jar](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/homemade-balsamic-peach-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 3 | Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n[Cut the peaches](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/) into thick wedges or halves, making sure they are about the same size (remove the pit).\n\nGet your grill preheated to medium-high. Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Brush the peaches with olive oil to prevent them from sticking. Grill the peaches on each flat side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed, or until they develop grill marks. Using a thin spatula, flip and grill the other side for another 2-3 minutes.\n\n### **Step 4 | Assemble the peach salad**\n\nArrange a bed of mixed greens on a large platter. Top with the berries, the prepared candied pecans, crumbled feta, and grilled peaches. Drizzle the assembled grilled peach salad with the prepared balsamic dressing…and ENJOY!\n\n**Prep Ahead Tips**\n-------------------\n\nI wouldn’t recommend making the entire peach salad in advance, but you can certainly prep a few components ahead. If you do this, you can make the entire salad in less than 20 minutes!\n\n*   **Make the candied pecans the day before** and let them cool on the counter overnight. Keep them in a container or in a covered bowl.\n*   **Make the balsamic dressing** up to 2 days in advance and refrigerate. Before using, let it sit at room temp and shake it vigorously again before using.\n*   **Note:** I wouldn’t recommend cutting the peaches until ready to grill. They will release lots of juices, and turn soft and brown overnight.\n\n**Substitutions and Variations**\n--------------------------------\n\nHere are my favorite substitutions for my grilled peach salad:\n\n*   **Greens:** I use a simple blend of mixed greens. You can also use baby spinach, arugula, or your favorite lettuce. For some crunch, use romaine or little gem lettuce.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts work great too! Also try toasted pine nuts, pistachios, or almonds.\n*   **Peaches:** If you can’t find peaches, nectarines are a great substitute.\n*   **Berries:** Mix and match!

Apricots may be a bit too small to grill properly, but you can.\n\n**Do you peel the peaches?**\n\nI personally prefer to keep the skin on, but you can peel them off if desired. I provide instructions in my [peach prep tutorial](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/).\n\n**How can I prevent the peaches from sticking to the grill?**\n\nMake sure the grill is HOT, brush the sliced peaches with oil, let them cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes before flipping, and use a thin spatula to lift and release the peaches from underneath the grill. Try not to use tongs.\n\n**Can I make this salad ahead?**\n\nGrilled peaches don’t store well, so I’d say no. However, you can make the balsamic dressing and the candied pecans in advance.\n\n**Tips for Success**\n--------------------\n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for sweetness but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **Don’t overcook** the peaches on the grill to prevent them from becoming mushy.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:** 1) Make sure the grill is HOT, 2) brush peaches with oil, and 3) let them grill undisturbed. 4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath.

Made with ripe and sweet peaches, plump berries, crisp greens, feta, and homemade candied pecans. It's drizzled with an easy honey balsamic dressing.\n\nCourse Salad\n\nCuisine American\n\nPrep Time 12 minutes\n\nCook Time 8 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings 6 people\n\nCalories 356kcal\n\n*   ▢\n*   ▢\n*   ▢\n\n#### For the salad\n\n*   ▢ 6 fresh peaches, ripe but firm\n*   ▢ Olive oil - for brushing the peaches\n*   ▢ ½ cup fresh blueberries\n*   ▢ ½ cup fresh blackberries\n*   ▢ 5 ounces mixed greens\n*   ▢ ½ cup feta cheese crumbles\n\n#### Simple candied pecans\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup light brown sugar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon water, plus more as needed\n*   ▢ 1 cup pecan halves\n*   ▢ A pinch of salt\n\n#### Honey balsamic dressing\n\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 clove garlic, finely minced\n*   ▢ 1 to 2 tablespoons honey - or to taste\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon dijon mustard\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### **Make the candied pecans**\n\n*   Heat a small skillet over medium-low heat, and melt brown sugar with the water. Add the pecans plus a pinch of salt to the skillet. Stir to coat the pecans in melted sugar for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool.\n    \n\n#### **Make the honey balsamic dressing**\n\n*   In a mason jar, combine all the honey balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar with the lid and shake vigorously until evenly combined (emulsified). Set aside.\n    \n\n#### **Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n*   [**Cut the peaches**](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/)**:** Insert a sharp knife along the natural line coming from the stem of the peach until you hit the pit in the center, and cut in half in this direction by rotating it around the knife. Separate each half and remove the pit. Then, cut each half into 2 or 3 thick wedges.\n    \n*   **Grill the peaches:** Preheat grill to medium-high heat (it needs to be hot to minimize sticking) and oil the grates. Brush the sliced peaches on both sides with some olive oil. Grill each side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed to allow grill marks to develop. Once ready, transfer to a plate. _**Tip:**_ _To flip the peaches, use a thin spatula and lift the peach from underneath to preserve the grill marks. Try not to use tongs._\n    \n\n#### **Assemble the salad**\n\n*   On a large platter, arrange a bed of mixed greens and top with the blackberries, blueberries, grilled peaches, candied pecans, and crumbled feta. Drizzle with the prepared honey balsamic vinegar to taste. Enjoy!\n    \n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:**  \n    1) Make sure the grill is preheated  \n    2) Brush the peaches and grill grates with olive oil  \n    3) Let them cook undisturbed until they get grill marks  \n    4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath. This will help maintain the grill marks on the peaches.\n*   **Prep ahead:** The dressing can be made up to 2 or 3 days in advance. The candied pecans can also be made up to 2 days ahead.  \n    Store leftovers in a container in the fridge for up to 3 days.\n\n**Substitutions:**\n\n*   **Peaches**: nectarines.\n*   **Berries:** Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Romaine, arugula, or a mix of various greens.\n\n_Nutritional values per serving are estimates only._\n\nCalories: 356kcal | Carbohydrates: 30g | Protein: 6g | Fat: 26g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 7mg | Sodium: 237mg | Potassium: 282mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 24g | Vitamin A: 636IU | Vitamin C: 14mg | Calcium: 34mg | Iron: 1mg"

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://lilluna.com/terms/).\n\n_Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness. They are perfect for meatless Monday or dinner with vegetarian friends!_\n\nServe spinach ricotta stuffed pepper with a grain of your choice! We love to serve our stuffed peppers with [rice](https://lilluna.com/crock-pot-rice/) or for more veggies, a [cauliflower rice.](https://lilluna.com/cauliflower-rice/) Either way, it’s delicious!\n\n![Stuffed Peppers served over a bed of white rice](https://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-peppers-resize-10.jpg \"Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness. They are perfect for meatless Monday or dinner with vegetarian friends!\")\n\nEasy Stuffed Peppers Recipe\n---------------------------\n\nI don’t eat too many meatless meals, but when I do they usually involve lots of cheese or cream. Hello [pizza](https://lilluna.com/margherita-pizza/) and [fettuccine](https://lilluna.com/easy-fettuccine-alfredo/)! Thank heavens for dairy and that I’m not allergic or intolerant. Seriously, I barely go a meal without some kind of dairy product.\n\nIf you like [cheese](https://lilluna.com/tag/cheese/) as much as I do then you’ll love these Spinach Ricotta Stuffed Peppers! The peppers are jam packed with sautéed onion, garlic, and spinach, plus ricotta and parmesan cheese! I can assure you each bite is so full of flavor.\n\nThis recipe calls for 2 bell peppers cut in half, which serves 4 people. But if you’re feeding a larger crowd, or you can eat more than one half pepper, you can easily double the recipe! In that case, the Costco size pack of bell peppers might come in handy. 😉\n\nThese stuffed peppers are so flavorful and cheesy and way too easy to throw together. I have a feeling I’m going to be making these a lot more this spring and summer.\n\n![Easy Stuffed Bell Peppers and grape tomatoes in a white baking dish](https://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-peppers-resize-5.jpg \"Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness. They are perfect for meatless Monday or dinner with vegetarian friends!\")\n\nHow to Make Stuffed Bell Peppers\n--------------------------------\n\nThis recipe is SO easy… And the peppers themselves only require a handful of ingredients!\n\n**FILLING.** Cook up some onions and garlic, wilt the spinach, season, and then mix it with the ricotta and Parmesan cheese.\n\n**STUFF.** Take the mixture and stuff it into each pepper half.\n\n**BAKE.** Toss the tomatoes into the 9×13 pan. Drizzle with a little olive oil and then salt and pepper. Arrange the stuffed peppers in the pan with the tomatoes and then bake at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes.\n\n**GARNISH.** Top with more parmesan, fresh basil or parsley.\n\nMeanwhile, make your grain. What’s your go-to grain? Quinoa, rice, orzo? I really enjoyed these peppers with [Orzo Rice](https://www.garnishandglaze.com/orzo-rice/). You just toast the orzo in butter until golden and then add some rice and proceed as you would normally cook rice. So good!\n\nTips + SToring INfo\n-------------------\n\n**Add protein** by incorporating roasted chickpeas, beans, or crumbled sausage/hamburger\n\n**To make it spicy**, add crushed red pepper flakes or a splash of hot sauce\n\n**STORE** stuffed peppers in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. The peppers will get softer as time progresses. \n\n**To make ahead,** assemble the stuffed peppers ahead of time and keep them covered in the fridge for 24 hours before baking. Bake like normal.\n\n**REHEAT** the stuffed peppers either in the microwave or in the oven. To reheat them in the oven you will want to cover them and bake them at 350 or 15-20 minutes until they’re warmed through. If you are using the microwave, heat them on high for 2 minutes.\n\n![Stuffed Peppers with Rice on a white plate](https://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-peppers-9.jpg \"Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness.

These meatballs are tender to the core! Nestled in a rich and creamy lemon sauce, they are perfect to serve over pasta, quinoa, or fluffy rice!\n\n![greek chicken meatballs in lemon cream sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-12-710x1065.jpg)\n\nWarm, hearty and deliciously creamy!\n\nThese tender, seared chicken meatballs are rolling around in a creamy lemon sauce that has a nice little zing! They’re warm and comforting but still offer a bright and beautiful lemony flavor that doesn’t leave you feeling heavy. Don’t be surprised if you catch the fam eating right out of the skillet while the sauce is still warm and tangy.\n\nIt’s the perfect transitional meal to take us from summer right into fall or from winter into spring. I’m not quite ready to let go of all the summer flavors, but with the gloomy weather we’ve been having lately, I’m ready for warm bowls of food again. Greek chicken meatballs totally fit the bill.\n\n![chicken meatballs in lemon sauce with cooked orzo in speckled bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**What do you need to make the Greek chicken meatballs?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Garlic + herbs:** minced garlic, chopped parsley, and dried oregano help add flavor the meatballs. You can use fresh or dried herbs for this recipe. Keep in mind you need roughly double the amount if you’re using fresh herbs.\n*   **Lemon zest:** brightens up the meatballs and adds just a fresh flavor to them\n*   **breadcrumbs:** are used for binding. I prefer to use [Panko](https://amzn.to/31UtFlz) breadcrumbs because they melt right into the meatballs and you don’t even realize they’re there.\n*   **Feta cheese:** adds tang and aids in binding the meatballs as well. Before this recipe, I had never added feta cheese to homemade meatballs, and I love the flavor they add.\n*   **An egg:** Acts as a binder to hold everything together.\n*   **Ground chicken:** I prefer to use ground chicken breasts, but I would think if you like chicken thighs, you might want to use ground thighs here. They would certainly add more flavor and retain extra moisture as well!\n\n![ingredients for the meatball ball mixture in stainless steel bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-17-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### **How to portion chicken meatballs:**\n\nOnce you’ve made the meatball mixture, divide it into 24-28 portions. I like to use a [cookie scoop](https://amzn.to/3jSfROH) so that the meatballs are all the same size. Doing this also cuts down on the guesswork for cooking the meatballs because they cook up in roughly the same amount of time when they’re the same size.\n\n### **What if the meatball mixture sticks to my hands?**\n\nIf the meatball mixture sticks to your hands when you’re rolling them, just spray the inside of your hands with a little cooking spray before grabbing the meat mixture. This should keep the mixture from sticking to your hands!\n\n![close up of cooked chicken meatball in lemon cream sauce on a spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-4-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**How to make Greek chicken meatballs:**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  In a bowl, combine everything but the meat mixture along with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. I use a fork to mix all the ingredients together.\n2.  When the ingredients are mix, add the ground chicken and mix until just combined. You don’t want to overwork the meat mixture or you’ll be left with tough and dry meatballs. Portion the meatballs using a cookie scoop into roughly 1 ½ tablespoon portions. \n3.  Add a drizzle of oil to a hot skillet and cook the meatballs for about 5-7 minutes or until they cook all the way through. You want to flip them so that they brown evenly on all sides. Be sure to not overcrowd the pan or they won’t brown!\n\n> **TIP:** At this point, you can allow the meatballs to cool and freeze them for later. If you plan on making this midweek and don’t have the time to fry the meatballs the day of, just freeze the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment. When frozen, transfer to a freezer-safe bag.\n\n![close up of prepared meatballs in lemon sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients for the lemon sauce for Greek chicken meatballs?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Butter:** Butter plays a two-part role in the sauce. We’ll use a little bit to sauté the garlic and flour in and the last tablespoon is added at the end to add creaminess and a little bit of luster to the sauce.\n*   **Garlic:** sautéed in butter it adds so much delicious flavor to the sauce\n*   **flour:** just a tablespoon is used in this recipe to help thicken the sauce\n*   **Chicken stock:** is the base of the creamy lemon sauce\n*   **Green olives:** briny green olives are the perfect pairing to the bright zingy lemon sauce. Capers would also work if you aren’t a fan of green olives\n*   **Egg yolks:** the egg yolks I know are an unusual addition to a cream sauce. They help emulsify the sauce and make it extra creamy and delicious! Trust me, I was super scared to try it too, but I have a foolproof method for you below!\n*   **Lemon juice + zest:** help flavor the sauce\n*   **Nutmeg:** Add a depth of flavor that works beautifully with all the lemony flavor in this recipe. [Freshly grated](https://amzn.to/2Ds0dtI) works best!\n\n![lemon sauce pouring from spoon oven meatballs in bowl with orzo](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-5-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**The secret to perfectly smooth lemon sauce:**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cook the flour:** Add a knob of butter to the skillet and allow the butter to melt. Saute the garlic in the butter until fragrant. Then, add the flour and whisk. You want to let the flour cook for 30 seconds to get rid of the raw flavor. Then, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Once the stock is completely incorporated, allow it to reach a simmer and then let cook for a few minutes until it thickens just a tad bit.\n2.  **Combine the yolks and lemon juice:** While the sauce is thickening, you want to add the lemon juice to a bowl along with the egg yolks and whisk them to combine. Then, once the sauce is thickened, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet to the lemon egg mixture as you whisk. **Adding the hot liquid to the eggs and lemon juice will help temper the yolks so that the sauce doesn’t break later.** You’ll repeat the same thing a total of three times or until you’ve added a total of 3 tablespoons of the liquid to the yolk mixture.\n3.  **Finish the sauce:** With the skillet on the lowest heat setting, stir the yolk mixture into the skillet. Once combined, kick the heat up to medium and continue to stir and cook the sauce for 4-6 minutes until it thickens to your liking. Keep in mind it will thicken quite a bit when it cools, so you don’t want to thicken it too much at this point if you plan on serving it later! Stir in the lemon zest and the nutmeg. Then, add the butter and green olives to the sauce and stir to combine. Place the meatballs back into the pan and allow them to just heat through. Serve warm over buttered orzo, or with fried bread on the side.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Greek Avgolemono Soup](https://littlespicejar.com/avgolemono-soup/)\n*   [Rustic Chicken Piccata Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/rustic-chicken-piccata-meatballs/)\n*   [French Onion Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/comforting-french-onion-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Cajun Chicken Meatballs in Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/cajun-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Swedish Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/swedish-meatballs/)\n*   [Firecracker Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/firecracker-chicken-meatballs/)\n\n![skillet with meatballs and sauce with wooden spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-7-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![Greek Chicken Meatballs in Lemon Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-735x1102.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Meatballs:\n\n*   5 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon zest AND chopped parsley\n*   ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs\n*   ⅓ cup grated yellow onions\n*   ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   1 large egg\n*   1 ½ teaspoon dried oregano (a little more if it’s fresh)\n*   1 ¼ pound lean ground chicken\n\n#### Lemon Olive Sauce:\n\n*   3 tablespoons salted cold butter, cubed\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n*   1 ½ cups low sodium chicken stock\n*   ½ cup green olives (or use ¼ cup capers!)\n*   2 teaspoons lemon zest + ⅓ cup lemon juice\n*   2 egg yolks\n*   ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **MEATBALLS:** In a medium bowl, using a fork, mix together all the ingredients except the ground chicken. You also want to add 1 teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper. When the ingredients are combined, add the ground chicken and mix until \\*just\\* combined. Just be sure you don’t overwork the meat. Roll into 24-28 meatballs using a cookie scoop or about 1 ½ tablespoon each.\n2.  **COOK:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle in a little oil. Add the meatballs to the skillet but do not overcrowd. Cook in batches if they don’t all fit. Sear the meatballs for 5-7 minutes, flipping to brown all sides evenly, until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. Remove the meatballs to a plate.\n3.  **SAUCE:** Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet along with the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn. Add the flour and whisk. Once the flour cooks for 30 seconds, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Then, allow the sauce to reach a simmer, and continue to cook for 3 minutes or until the sauce thickens a bit. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and let the sauce hang out. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and egg yolks. Once combined, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet into the egg mixture while you whisk it. Repeat this step two more times (so a total of 3 tablespoon of sauce should be added to the yolks.) Then, with the heat on the lowest setting, add the yolk mixture to the sauce you have on the stove. Kick the heat up to medium and stir the sauce and allow it to cook for 4-6 minutes or until it thickens to your liking. Then, stir in the nutmeg and lemon zest. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper as desired. Add the last tablespoon of butter to the sauce and allow it to melt in slowly. Add the green olives to the sauce along with the meatballs. Let them heat through for just a minute or two until warm. Serve with fried bread, over buttered orzo, or rice!\n\nThis site contains affiliate links, if you make a purchase through them, we receive a small commission.\n\n_originally published on_ Sep 3, 2020 _(last updated_ Jul 9, 2022_)_\n\n[54 comments](https://littlespicejar.com/greek-chicken-meatballs-in-lemon-cream-sauce/#comments) [Leave a comment »](#respond)"

The ground pork has a higher fat content than the ground beef which keeps these meatballs perfectly juicy and flavorful.\n\n**Step One:** The first step to making these meatballs is to chop the herbs, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. For ultimate flavor this recipe uses a combination of fresh mint, dill, and parsley as well as red onion and garlic.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8c4b5e6.jpg)\n\n**Step Two:** Once you have chopped everything, now it’s time to make the meatballs. Add the ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, and herbs to a mixing bowl. This is also when you’ll add the dried herbs, spices, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything until well combined.\n\n**Step Three:** When the meat, herbs, and spices are well combined use a cookie dough scoop to form the meatballs and then roll them in between the palm of your hands. Place them on a sheet pan that has been drizzled with olive oil.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8d074cf.jpg)\n\n**Step Four:** After all of the meatballs have been rolled and placed on the sheet pan, bake them at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes until they have cooked all the way through.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8e065f6.jpg)\n\nCool and Creamy Tzatziki Sauce\n------------------------------\n\nThe meatballs are definitely the star of this recipe but the cool and creamy tzatziki sauce deserves an award, too. If you have never had tzatziki before I am incredibly excited for you to try this recipe because, honestly, it just might change your life. I know that’s a bold claim but trust me.\n\nTzatziki is a thick sauce made from a combination of Greek yogurt, cucumber, dill, garlic, salt, and lemon juice. Tzatziki sauce is great with these meatballs but it is also perfect as a dip for fresh veggies, pita bread, or crackers.\n\nIf you have had tzatziki before but you’ve been intimidated by the idea of making it at home yourself, this is your lucky day. Homemade tzatziki is so easy to make and, personally, one of my favorite condiments to make at home.\n\nHaving a food processor or high-powered blender makes whipping up a batch of tzatziki even easier because you can quickly chop the garlic, dill, and cucumber. Once that step is done, all you have to do is add the cumber, garlic, dill, Greek yogurt, salt, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Stir everything until well combined and store in the fridge!\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8eb6aee.jpg)\n\nHow to Serve the Meatballs\n--------------------------\n\nThere are few different ways you can serve these meatballs and they are all absolutely delicious. I encourage you to get creative but, of course, I’ll share some of my favorite ways to eat these yummy meatballs!\n\n*   **Serve them an appetizer or party snack!** These Greek meatballs are perfect to serve at a dinner party or as a fun appetizer. You can make a double batch of the meatball, put a cocktail stick in each one, and then serve the tzatziki on the side as a dipping sauce.\n    \n\n*   **Make a delicious Greek salad bowl!** This is one of my favorite ways to serve these meatballs. Place them over a bed of fresh romaine or your favorite mixed greens and serve with tomatoes, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, dill, peppers, and whatever other veggies sound good. You can also add rice or [Greek chickpea salad](https://www.allthehealthythings.com/recipeindex/greek-chickpea-salad) to your bowl if you would like. Finish off your bowl with a generous drizzle of tzatziki.\n    \n\n*   **Stuff them in a pita!** If a Greek pita sandwich is more your thing, feel free to stuff these meatballs in a pita with chopped lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, and of course, plenty of tzatziki sauce.\n    \n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8f8e159.jpg)\n\nIf You Love This Greek Meatball Recipe, Here a Few More Delicious Recipes You Should Try\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Greek Chicken Meatballs\n*   One Pan Greek Chicken with Artichokes\n*   Greek Pasta Salad\n*   Greek Salmon Salad\n*   Greek Broccoli Pasta Salad\n\nI hope you give these **Greek Meatballs** a try!

    "markdown": "# Spicy Honey-Lime Chicken - Two Kooks In The Kitchen\nThe combination of honey (or maple syrup), soy sauce, sriracha, zesty lime, garlic and ginger in this spicy honey lime chicken recipe is wicked. Delicious hot, room temp or cold.\n\nYou can make the recipe with whole boneless chicken thighs or chicken breasts on skewers or with bone-in chicken.\n\n![3 chicken thigh skewers on cutting board](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0023.jpg)\n\nMy favorite is boneless skinless chicken thighs (pictured here) because they are so flavorful, they absorb the marinade well and they tend to stay moister than breasts. If you’ve read any of our other chicken posts, you’ve heard this. Many times.\n\nThe spicy honey lime chicken marinade with its tart citrus tang – so delicious, so much flavor – also works well with pork skewers, tenderloin or chops. Even tofu. It’s one of my favorite chicken thigh recipes.\n\nBest side dish for this chicken dinner\n--------------------------------------\n\nThat’s hard. So many things go well with honey-lime chicken thighs. Here are some great ideas for a side and side salad: [citrus salad](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/citrus-salad/), [easy potato knishes](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/super-easy-potato-knishes/), [bread salad with charred snap peas](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/bread-salad-with-charred-snap-peas/), [grilled corn salad](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-corn-salad/), [party salad with grilled vegetables and quinoa,](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/party-salad-grilled-vegetables-quinoa/) [roasted baby cauliflower](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/roasted-baby-cauliflower/) and [grilled vegetable orzo salad recipe](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-vegetable-orzo/).\n\nTailor To Your Taste\n--------------------\n\n### **How to serve honey lime chicken**\n\n*   I love the grilled chicken skewers format the best because you get the maximum glaze covering the chicken. But you can also use whole chicken breasts or thighs. If using bone-in, I suggest doubling the marinade.\n*   For appetizers, use regular boneless chicken thighs or breasts. Once cooked, cut the chicken into small pieces and thread on small wooden skewers or toothpicks to serve.\n*   The chicken is fabulous served in pita or tortillas with a tangy coleslaw or Israeli salad.\n\n### **Options for honey lime chicken marinade**\n\n*   Vary the amount of sriracha heat you like. The amount in the recipe is fairly spicy. I know some will like it even hotter. Or some not at all. If you don’t have sriracha, try chili powder or red pepper flakes.\n*   Replace the lime with lemon in the honey lime mixture (marinade).\n*   Try adding coriander or a favorite spice to the marinade.\n\n### **Cooking method alternatives**\n\n*   If you don’t have a grill, broil the chicken skewers in the oven for 9-12 minutes.\n*   Cooking time will take longer with bone in chicken. Heat one side of the grill on low, the other on medium high. Cook until almost done ((140F) on the low side, then switch to the hotter side to brown and finish cooking.\n\nShortcuts\n---------\n\n*   Skip the skewers and cook boneless or bone-in chicken (not cut up). Still delish! And **dinner in 20 minutes**.\n*   Substitute 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder for the fresh garlic.\n*   Marinate at room temperature for 30-40 minutes instead of 4-6 hours or overnight in the fridge. Or skip the marinating altogether. The flavors won’t be as intense, but still great. Consider doubling the sauce or making 1 1/2 times the amount if you are not marinating the chicken.\n\nHow to make spicy honey-lime chicken\n------------------------------------\n\n![cut up boneless chicken thighs, salt, sriracha, ginger, soy, maple syrup, garlic, lime juice, lime](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9970.jpg)\n\nIngredients: Cut up boneless chicken thighs, salt, sriracha, ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, lime juice, lime\n\n![boneless chicken thighs marinating in ziploc bag](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9978.jpg)\n\nMake the marinade and use half of it to marinate the chicken.

Delicious hot, room temp or cold.\n\nPrep Time10 minutes\n\nCook Time10 minutes\n\nMarinating time30 minutes\n\nTotal Time50 minutes\n\nCourse: Appetizer, Main Course\n\nCuisine: American\n\nServings: 5\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    Skewers (metal or wood). If using wood, soak for 30 minutes before using. Skewers not needed if using uncut boneless or bone in chicken.\n    \n\n*   ▢ 2 1/2 pounds (1.13kg) boneless skinless thighs, trimmed and cut into 2 inch/5.1cm pieces, **Note 1** **chicken tenders or boneless breasts are fine too**\n*   ▢ **Garnish**: 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro or parsley; lime wedges\n\n#### Honey Lime chicken marinade (and glaze), Note 2\n\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoon soy sauce low sodium is good if you have\n*   ▢ 6 tablespoon honey or maple syrup\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon lime zest from one lime\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoon fresh lime juice from 1 1/2 to 2 limes\n*   ▢ 4 garlic cloves, minced or grated (or 1/2 tsp garlic powder)\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (about 1 1/2 inch of fresh ginger)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tablespoon Sriracha sauce for pretty spicy (use more or less to taste)\n*   ▢ 1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch (to thicken to glaze consistency) Optional\n\n*   **MAKE MARINADE/SAUCE**: Whisk all marinade ingredients together in a small bowl. Or blend them in a food processor.\n    \n*   **MARINATE CHICKEN:** Pour **half** the marinade (about 1/2 cup) into a sealed zipper bag or container and add chicken. Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or 6-12 hours in fridge. _Tip: if marinating overnight, I leave out lime juice and increase zest so it doesn't 'cook' the chicken._\n    \n    **Glaze:** The reserved 1/2 cup marinade will be used for glazing/basting. _(_**Optional but suggested**_: Mix 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch into reserved marinade and microwave for 1 minute to make a glaze-like consistency. I do this)._ Set aside.\n    \n*   **PREPARE GRILL**: Scrape grill and spray grill with oil (or dip paper towel in oil and rub on grill). Heat grill to medium-high heat. If using wood skewers, soak them for 30 minutes beforehand to avoid burning. **Note 3**.\n    \n*   **GRILL CHICKEN SKEWERS**: Skewer marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and _pat dry (__important__)_. Discard the marinade used for marinating. Lightly spray chicken with oil to further avoid sticking. Grill on all sides until chicken cooks to a golden brown (you'll need to turn chicken a couple of times), for 9-12 minutes in total (depending on thickness and how tightly packed the skewers are), basting once or twice with the honey lime glaze. Instant thermometer will read 160F/71C. Rest chicken, loosely covered for 5 minutes.\n    \n*   **SERVE**: If you have any leftover sauce, drizzle it on the chicken or warm it in microwave for 30 seconds and pass it around. Sprinkle chicken with cilantro or parsley and serve with lime wedges if desired. Serve hot or at room temperature.\n    \n\n1.  **Chicken options:**\n    *   I prefer thighs because they are juicier and less likely to dry out when cooked. In this recipe, however, breasts work really well too when marinated.\n    *   Instead of skewered chicken, you can also cook regular bone-in or boneless chicken (but make extra marinade for bone-in)\n    *   Kosher chicken is juicier and has a little extra flavor because it is already brined. \n2.  **Marinade/glaze**: If you are using bone in chicken, I suggest doubling the marinade/glaze. In fact, you might also want to double it (or do 1 1/2 times the amounts) to use as a dipping sauce or to soak into a side of rice or quinoa. \n3.  **No grill?** Instead, chicken can be broiled in the oven, turning once, for 9-12 minutes, brushing with the glaze.\n4.  **Make Ahead:** The recipe can be made ahead for a crowd and served at room temperature or cold.

Italian Style Chicken Sausages**      – _the kind that are already cooked and ready to go_\n*   **Diced Onion**\n*   **Garlic**\n*   **Crushed Red Pepper**        – _this is optional, but does add a great boost of flavor to the dish_\n*   **Chicken Broth**\n*   **8 oz. uncooked pasta**       – _I’m using Radiatore because I love the shape (my 18 month old loves them), but any small pasta will work_\n*   **Zucchini**\n*   **Grated Parmesan Cheese**       – _the kind that comes in a can, or you can use fresh too!_\n*   **Lemon Juice**\n*   **Grape Tomatoe**s        – _bonus points if they’re from the garden!_\n*   **Fresh Basil**         – _I’ve used the basil in a tube before and it works great if you’re out of fresh_\n\n![Sautéd chicken sausages and diced onion in pan](https://iwashyoudry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chicken-Zucchini-Pasta-Skillet.jpg)\n\nHow To Make Chicken Zucchini Pasta Skillet\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.  Start by browning your chicken sausage in a skillet along with your onion until the onion is tender and the chicken sausage is browned slightly.\n2.  Add in some salt, crushed red pepper (if using) and garlic and stir until fragrant. Pour in the chicken broth and scrape any brown bits off the bottom of the pan (that’s where a lot of flavor is!).\n3.  Bring the skillet to a boil and stir in the uncooked pasta, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the pasta is mostly tender.\n4.  Add in the chopped zucchini and continue cooking for an additional 3 minutes, until zucchini is tender and the majority of the chicken broth is absorbed into the pasta.\n5.  Finally, stir in the lemon juice, parmesan cheese and tomatoes, until combined and heated through. Garnish with the fresh basil and enjoy!\n\n![Skillet filled with pasta, sausages, zucchini and tomatoes in a lemon basil sauce.](https://iwashyoudry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chicken-Zucchini-Pasta-Skillet-3.jpg)\n\nThis quick and easy dinner is perfect for using up garden zucchini, tomatoes and basil! BUT- it’s also great for customizing to your taste and what ingredients you have on hand. Here are some great ways to switch it up…\n\nTips and Variations:\n--------------------\n\n*   Swap out the zucchini for other veggies like – broccoli, green beans, asparagus or quartered Brussels sprouts (if it’s a more dense veggie, add it to the pasta earlier to allow time for softening).\n*   Feel free to use any sort of sausage in place of the chicken sausages. Even ground Italian sausage would be great here!\n*   Try adding in a tablespoon of lemon zest at the end with the lemon juice to give it an even bigger boost of fresh flavor.\n*   Use any sort of small pasta shape – small shells, macaroni, ditalini, farfalle (bowtie), orecchiette, campanelle, etc.\n\n![A great way to use summer zucchini](https://iwashyoudry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chicken-Zucchini-Pasta-Skillet-5.jpg)\n\nMore Ways To Use Summer Zucchini\n--------------------------------\n\nWe planted zucchini this year and can’t wait to be able to use it all up!

Cut the zucchini and mushrooms in half, then section the bell pepper into larger chunks. The red onion can be cut into thick rings.\n*   _**Season:**_ Place all the sliced vegetables onto a tray and drizzle them generously with olive oil. The oil will help the seasonings stick and helps the veggies grill better. Add all the seasonings and spices next: salt, pepper, paprika, thyme and rosemary.\n*   _**Preheat**_ an indoor grill pan over medium-high heat or an outdoor grill to 500F. Once the grill grates are super hot, add the vegetables in a single layer onto the hot grill.

Green zucchini takes a little longer, about 5 minutes per side.\n\n![grilled vegetables with zesty garlic dressing](https://tatyanaseverydayfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Garlic-Grilled-Veggie-Salad-2-768x1024.jpg)\n\nMaking the Cilantro Garlic Dressing\n-----------------------------------\n\nOnce the vegetables are grilled, remove them from the grill and onto a large tray.

This zesty and refreshing dressing is made with loads of freshly minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and chopped cilantro. Just mix the ingredients in a small bowl or measuring cup.\n\nAssembling the Grilled Vegetable Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nOnce you have the vegetables grilled and the salad dressing ready to go, it’s easy to assemble the salad!\n\n1.

It's the perfect vegetarian salad for fall and always so delicious! | gimmesomeoven.com\")\n\nThings are finally _(fi-na-lly!)_ cooling off here in Barcelona this week after the summer’s unrelenting heat wave, which of course instantly has me craving all of my nostalgic fall faves…including this yummy roasted sweet potato and arugula salad. ♡\n\nIt’s a simple one that you could easily make anytime of year. But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like. And if you feel like adding in an extra protein, some grilled chicken or bacon would be delicious mixed in too.\n\nLet’s make some salad together!  \n\n![Favorite Fall Salad Ingredients](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-1.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

We’ll then dice them into 1/2-inch cubes, toss with olive oil, season generously with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n*   **Greens:** I’m partial to the peppery flavor of fresh arugula in this salad, but you could also use baby kale (or other varieties of kale), baby spinach, or any other salad greens that you prefer.\n*   **Avocado:** Feel free to dice or thinly slice the avocado, which adds a lovely creaminess to the salad.\n*   **Crumbled cheese:** I love the tart and tangy flavor of goat cheese in this salad, but feta, blue, cheddar, or Manchego cheese would be delicious alternatives too.\n*   **Nuts:** Just about any of your favorite nuts or seeds will work well in this salad — pecans, walnuts, almonds, pepitas, you choose!\n*   **Dried berries:** Dried cranberries always feel so quintessentially fall-ish to me, but dried cherries, raisins or even apricots would work well too.\n*   **Dressing:** My [everyday salad dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/salad-dressing/) goes beautifully with this salad, made with a quick blend of olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, garlic, salt and pepper.\n\n![Step by step instructions for how to make favorite fall salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fall-Salad-Collage.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

For example, you are welcome to…\n\n*   **Add a protein:** Cooked chicken, bacon, steak, shrimp or tofu would be delicious mixed in here.\n*   **Add other mix-ins:** Extra roasted veggies (such as beets, butternut squash, carrots, fennel, green beans or pumpkin), extra fresh veggies (bell pepper, radishes, red onion), rice or grains (quinoa, farro, wild rice), beans, olives, or sun-dried tomatoes would be other fun options for mix-ins.\n*   **Use a different dressing:** I also love making this salad with my [dreamy tahini dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/dreamy-tahini-dressing/) for a different spin on the recipe.\n*   **Make it vegan:** Swap your favorite vegan cheese in place of goat cheese, or omit the cheese altogether and add in a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.\n\n![Favorite Fall Salad in Bowl with Lemon Vinaigrette](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-5.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

Is it just me, or is pumpkin everywhere this year?! Pumpkin Spice Cookies, Pumpkin Spice Cereal, Pumpkin Spice Peanut Butter, and of course, the iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte. It’s a bit overwhelming – I even have a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/Platingspairing/pumpkin/) dedicated solely to Pumpkin.\n\nIn an effort to keep up with the Pumpkin-wielding Jonses, I’m throwing this Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese & Dried Cranberries into the mix.\n\nWhile some people may have a _pumpkin_ obsession, my obsession generally lies with [risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/category/recipes/risotto/). Like my [Lemon Mascarpone Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/lemon-mascarpone-risotto/), [Beet Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/beet-risotto-goat-cheese/) and [Grilled Shrimp Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/grilled-shrimp-risotto/).\n\nNot only do I like eating risotto, but I thoroughly enjoy the process of making it – Mainly because I get to stand over a hot stove when it’s freezing cold outside. Freezing cold = 60 degrees and below in my book.\n\nThe process of making risotto is easy, but it does take some babysitting because you need to “feed” the risotto. We’re _feeding_ the risotto with a ladle full of stock time after time, letting it fully absorb between each addition.\n\nThe process takes about 20 minutes from start to finish, and it’s a full evolution. The risotto starts as hard grains of rice, then it becomes more plump, and then, through all the stirring and the feeding, it takes on the most incredible creamy texture that’s tasty on it’s own, but also totally customizable with any ingredients of your choosing.\n\n[![Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese and Dried Cranberries in bowl with a Barolo wine pairing.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pumpkin-risotto-6-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/pumpkin-risotto-6-2/)\n\nThis is the most amazing fall risotto. The [pumpkin](http://amzn.to/2kDojCT) and [dried cranberries](http://amzn.to/2kDhsJS) just call out Thanksgiving to me. Plus, I’m making this risotto totally meat free, meaning that it would be a perfect option to serve for a vegetarian Thanksgiving.\n\nThe creamy pumpkin lends a rich, earthy flavor to the mix, the goat cheese adds tang and creaminess, and the dried cranberries give zing and add their beautiful color to the dish.\n\nHow to make ahead & reheat\n--------------------------\n\n*   **To store:** Keep any leftover risotto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n*   **To reheat:** Place the leftovers into a pan with a bit of extra broth and heat over medium heat until warmed through.\n\nHere’s a full post with my tips on [how to reheat risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/how-to-reheat-risotto/).\n\n[![Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese and Dried Cranberries in bowl - Close up shot.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pumpkin-risotto-4-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/pumpkin-risotto-4-2/)\n\n🍽 Serving suggestions\n----------------------\n\n*   [Easy Arugula Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/perfect-green-arugula-salad/)\n*   [Sauteed Spinach](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/easy-sauteed-spinach-recipe/)\n*   [Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/brussels-sprouts-salad/)\n*   [Vegan Caesar Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/vegan-caesar-salad/)\n*   [Shaved Fennel Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/fennel-celery-salad/)\n*   **MORE —> 35+ EASY [sides for risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/what-to-serve-with-risotto/)!**\n\nWhat’s your favorite pumpkin dish or product of the season?

This girl!\n\nOf course it took posting a photo of this plate-o-yum on IG to give me the push I needed. I have some very awesome friends with some very impatient squash (_squashes? squashi? I think I’m overthinking this!_) awaiting this recipe. I had to deliver!\n\nWithout further ado, here’s my  all-time favorite butternut squash recipe. Hands-down. No question.\n\nThis savory sweet side dish is perfect for the holidays and you should totally make it right now!\n\nWell, make it now, and then make it AGAIN for the holidays.\n\nAll of them.\n\n_Duh._\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta One Pan Sheet Pan Recipe](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-0208.jpg)\n\nso . . . how is it?!\n--------------------\n\nDelightfully delicious! The combination of sweetness from the butternut squash and honey paired perfectly with the tart and juicy cranberries is a thing of beauty!\n\nThe dish is super customizable too, so feel free to make it as sweet or sassy as you’d like. The feta adds a delightful twist, and can easily be swapped for an uber creamy goat cheese as well. I hope you love this tasty holiday side dish as much as we do! It’s become a staple in our house and I have a feeling it will be for years to come!\n\nThis simple side can be whipped up with just a few fresh ingredients and is loaded with Fall flavor.\n\nAs an added bonus, as the butternut squash roasts away it fills the house with the most delicious aromas. I had to hold myself back from climbing in the oven with it after the twenty minute mark. It was a little less Sylvia Plath and a little more was more “_LET ME AT THAT SQUASH!_” I may have stolen a few cubes to munch on when I added the cranberries. _So good!_\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta - This sweet and savory side dish is perfect for the holidays and loaded with Fall flavor!](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-feta-recipe-thanksgiving-0245-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 3 lb large butternut squash (peeled + chopped)\n*   ▢ 1-2 TBSP [extra virgin olive oil](https://amzn.to/2QvhPq6)\n*   ▢ salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste\n*   ▢ 1-2 cups fresh cranberries (add a little, or a lot!)\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP honey plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ ¼ cup finely crumbled feta\n*   ▢ ground cinnamon to taste \n*   ▢ fresh or dried parsley to garnish, optional\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F.\n    \n*   Lightly drizzle or spritz a baking sheet with olive oil.\n    \n*   Add cubed squash to the sheet along with another drizzle of olive oil.\n    \n*   Sprinkle with a light layer of salt, pepper, and garlic powder, based on taste preference.\n    \n*   Roast at 400 F for 25 minutes on the center rack.\n    \n*   At the 25 minute mark, pull out the oven rack, and add your fresh cranberries to the roasting pan.\n    \n*   Return to the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cranberries have started to soften and burst a bit, resembling really juicy craisins vs fresh firm cranberries.\n    \n*   Remove from oven and add a sprinkle of cinnamon (approx. 1/8-1/4 tsp depending on preference) along with feta and honey. I listed the honey measurements I used, but depending on whether you used fresh cranberries or dried, sweeten to taste.\n    \n*   Garnish with parsley for a burst of color and dig in while it's hot!\n    \n\nFeel free to use fresh or dried cranberries for this dish.\n\nDried will be sweeter, while fresh with have a delightful punch of tartness to pair with the buttery squash and sweet honey.

I still bake with it because it’s an awesome natural sweetener and I adore it so, but if I have the option to keep it as close to raw as possible, I do. Hence adding the honey after roasting the squash and cranberries in this recipe. The fruit and veggie medley is still just warm enough to allow the honey to cover the dish as a deliciously sweet glaze, but not so scorching that it’s spending 30+ minutes in my oven losing all it’s fabulous benefits.\n\n_File this under things I tell myself so I can eat more honey._\n\nIf you’re as squash obsessed as I am right now, you should totally take your Fall/Winter menu up a few notches and try my [Cheesy Garlic Parmesan Spaghetti Squash](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/09/cheesy-garlic-parmesan-spinach-spaghetti-squash.html) and Butternut Cauliflower Soup.\n\nSO DELICIOUS!\n\nIf you get a chance to try this Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta, let me know!\n\nYou can leave me a comment here (LOVE checking those daily!) or tag @PEASandCRAYONS #PEASANDCRAYONS on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peasandcrayons) so I can happy dance over your creations!

I’ve done some experimenting and here’s what I’ve got so far!\n\nI’ve found the best advance-prep results were when I pre-roasted the squash for around 25-30 minutes and then before serving, I tossed the room temperature squash back in the oven along with the cranberries for an additional 10 minutes or so until the cranberries started to burst and the squash crisped back up around the edges (yet still creamy and buttery on the inside!). I reheated it in the oven just before serving so the feta and honey were added to the still-warm dish and it worked great!\n\nI have also cooked the squash and berries in their entirety and popped them in the fridge. I let it come to room temp for a bit then reheated them in the oven for around 10 minutes before serving, adding the cheese/honey after as well. The first method had more of the texture I was looking for but the results from this method were still good!\n\nLet me know if you find another method that works great for you as well!\n\nLast year I even slapped the leftover honey roasted butternut squash with cranberries on an epic Thanksgiving leftover sandwich (with all the fixings) and it was amazing!\n\nPeas and Crayons is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites at no cost to readers.\n\n[![Jenn Laughlin Headshot Photo - About the Author](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jenn-laughlin-headshot-peasandcrayons--scaled-e1716318471546-600x600.jpg)](https://peasandcrayons.com/about)\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nJenn Laughlin\n-------------\n\nJenn Laughlin created Peas and Crayons in 2009 after graduating with B.S. in Dietetics from Florida State University while working as a Nutrition Educator for WIC.

We ate leftovers for every meal on Friday, switched it up with [tacos](https://www.thekitchn.com/beef-taco-recipe-23020688) on Saturday, and ordered [pizza](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-really-good-pizza-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-178384) on Sunday because we still didn’t feel like cooking. The next few days for lunch will probably be more leftovers, because I can’t see beyond the mountain of plastic-wrapped [mashed potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-180434) and [stuffing](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-the-very-best-thanksgiving-stuffing-237564) in the fridge to even try and dig for a fresh vegetable.\n\nWhen I do break free and get back to some type of normalcy, I know exactly what I’ll be eating to help me reset.

Everything roasts together in the oven: big cubes of [sweet potato](https://www.thekitchn.com/roasted-sweet-potatoes-263158), crunchy pepitas, and even oversized crumbles of feta, which take on this wonderful chewy-creamy texture when warmed. Instead of sautéing the [cauliflower rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice-couscous-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203344) (buy it pre-riced to save time), you’ll also throw it into the oven. Tossing it with [turmeric](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipes-with-turmeric-223795) gives it a gorgeous golden hue and a slightly earthy flavor.\n\nWhile everything’s roasting, you’ll mix up a fresh bean salad: a [can of chickpeas](https://www.thekitchn.com/chickpea-recipes-234833), a handful of [herbs](https://www.thekitchn.com/your-guide-to-storing-fresh-herbs-in-the-fridge-231412), a drizzle of [olive oil](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-olive-oil-and-extra-virgin-olive-oil-word-of-mouth-218767), and a squeeze of [lime juice](https://www.thekitchn.com/5-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-juice-from-limes-amp-lemons-tips-from-the-kitchn-119886). Pile onto the [roasted veg](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221), then enjoy for lunch right after it’s made or divvy into lunch containers and eat throughout the week. You don’t even need to futz with a dressing — just drizzle with more oil and a squeeze a lime juice before diving in.\n\nThe flexibility of this recipe makes it extra budget-friendly. Use whatever root vegetable you have on hand or is on sale at the grocery store. Buy pepitas in the bulk section, or swap out another nut or seed that’s already stashed in your pantry. It’s delicious any way you make it.\n\n[Comments](#comments-263225)\n\nAn easy, protein-packed vegetarian lunch bowl made with cauliflower rice, sweet potatoes, and a vibrant chickpea salad.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    root vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, or a combination, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes\n    \n*   4 tablespoons\n    \n    olive oil, divided, plus more for serving\n    \n*   1 1/2 teaspoons\n    \n    kosher salt, divided\n    \n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n    \n*   4 ounces\n    \n    feta cheese, drained\n    \n*   1/4 cup\n    \n    pumpkin seeds\n    \n*   3 cups\n    \n    fresh or frozen cauliflower rice, such as Trader Joe's\n    \n*   1/2 teaspoon\n    \n    ground turmeric\n    \n*   1 (15.5-ounce) can\n    \n    chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1/2 cup\n    \n    coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems\n    \n*   Finely grated zest of 2 medium limes\n    \n*   Juice of 2 medium limes, plus more wedges for serving\n    \n*   1\n    \n    medium avocado, pitted and quartered\n    \n\n1.  Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to 425°F. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, then season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and several grinds of black pepper. Toss to combine, then arrange into an even layer. Roast on the lower rack until beginning to brown, about 20 minutes.\n    \n2.  Flip the sweet potatoes and push them to one side. Add the pumpkin seeds to the now-empty portion of the baking sheet and crumble the feta into large pieces over the sweet potatoes. Place the cauliflower rice (if using frozen, break up any clumps first), turmeric, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and several grinds of black pepper on a second rimmed baking sheet and toss until evenly combined. Spread into an even layer.\n    \n3.  Place the sweet potatoes on the upper rack and the cauliflower rice on the lower rack. Roast until the pumpkin seeds are toasted, the sweet potatoes are golden-brown, and the feta is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl and toss until evenly coated; set aside.\n    \n4.  **For each serving:** Transfer 1/4 of the rice, 1/4 of the sweet potato and feta mixture, and 1/4 of the chickpea mixture into a bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the pepitas and top with a piece of the avocado (peel the avocado if eating immediately). Drizzle with more olive oil and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve with a lime wedge.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Storage:** Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."

Using a meat mallet or the bottom of your fry pan, pound breasts to even thickness (you don't want the meat super-flat, just even in thickness). Place the prepared chicken in a large sealable plastic bag and set aside.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon lime zest, 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, minced garlic, honey, cumin, coriander, and salt and pepper (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of each; add to your preference). Once the mixture is well combined, remove 3 tablespoons of the mixture and reserve for later.\n    \n*   Add the rest of the marinade to the bag with the chicken. Seal the bag and then knead with your hands to ensure all of the chicken is well coated. Place in the fridge and marinate for at least 30 minutes and preferably 2-3 hours. Don't marinate longer than 6 hours. (Acid from lime begins to \"cook\" the chicken.)\n    \n*   Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (about 400 degrees F.). Generously oil the grill (I drench a roll-up paper towel in vegetable oil and, holding it with tongs, rub it over the grill grates. Don't skip this step.) Start by grilling the pineapple **(See Note 1)** so you can work on the salsa while the chicken cooks. Rub about 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil over all sides of the pineapple. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.\n    \n*   Remove chicken from marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.\n    \n*   While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.\n    \n*   We like to serve Pineapple Chicken with coconut rice or cilantro-lime rice. If you'd like those recipes, check for the links to those recipes right above this recipe card!\n    \n\n**Note** **1**: You don't have to grill the pineapple, but it does add an amazing sweetness (it caramelizes as it grills) to the dish. Check pictures in the post for the size of pineapple to grill. (I cut the cored and peeled the pineapple and cut into about 9 or 10 long strips.) Once grilled, I slice each pineapple strip in 3 long strips and then dice those long strips into small pieces for the salsa. Use a sharp knife here! You will likely have more pineapple salsa than needed to top chicken, but we like a lot--or finish the rest off with chips. You can halve the pineapple salsa recipe, but I like it as written, so I don't waste the rest of the veggies.\n\n**Note 2**: A good, ripe avocado adds a delicious creamy element to this dish. If you don't add avocado and want a creamy element, I'd recommend the [jalapeno sauce from this recipe](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/jamaican-jerk-tacos/).

This creamy pumpkin pasta with toasted walnuts and spinach dish is as flavorful as it is nutritious.

Though they loved the smell of it, there were more than a few side-eyes in the room. No one had used pumpkin in pasta before and let’s just say they were skeptical but curious. Well. It was a hit!\n\nMost people said they couldn’t taste the pumpkin. And that’s not surprising. Pumpkin doesn’t have a strong flavor. The flavors we associate with pumpkin usually come from the spices paired with it. There is one major exception. Fresh pumpkin can be incredible when it’s roasted until it’s caramelized and sweet.\n\n[This 20-minute Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts & Spinach is perfect for fall!](https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=This%2020-minute%20Pumpkin%20Pasta%20with%20Toasted%20Walnuts%20%26amp%3B%20Spinach%20is%20perfect%20for%20fall%21%20%23easyrecipes&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarisamoore.com%2Fpumpkin-pasta-toasted-walnuts-spinach%2F&via=marisamoore)\n\nThat’s not what I’m using today. Maybe later. Today, I used leftover canned pumpkin to make a luscious, silky smooth pumpkin pasta sauce that’s full of nutrition. It’s got vitamin C, beta-carotene, and fiber which can help keep the immune system and your skin glowing as the weather starts to cool down.\n\nYou can use any pasta you’d like. For more protein and fiber but without changing the flavor of the dish too much, I suggest using chickpea pasta. I prefer it to whole wheat or some of the other “healthy” pasta options.\n\nIf you’re living on the edge, boil some water and cook some old school, regular white pasta! I’m just being sarcastic. Use the pasta that works for you and your family. Just don’t overcook it.\n\nCan you make a dairy-free pumpkin sauce?\n----------------------------------------\n\nYes. I used a little half and half in this recipe because it adds a lovely texture and richness to the sauce. If you are avoiding dairy, try adding a bit more olive oil and broth instead of milk or cream. This substitution will also make the recipe more of a pantry meal.\n\nThe parmesan is, of course, a nice savory, salty addition. You can leave it out for a vegan recipe. If you find that the recipe needs a little something else, add a little What’s the Deal with Nutritional Yeast? to the sauce and blend until smooth.\n\n![Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts and Spinach in bowls with two forks](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Exported-4-2.jpg)\n\nHow to make pumpkin pasta sauce\n-------------------------------\n\nFor the sauce: sauté fresh garlic in olive oil just until fragrant. Add the other ingredients and let it simmer. I found that this sauce tastes better the longer it simmers. It tastes even better the next day, so it’s the perfect pumpkin pasta sauce for meal prep! I stored it in a mason jar and used it throughout the week. It also freezes well on its own.\n\nOnce the pumpkin sauce is ready,  add a couple of large handfuls of baby spinach. Add in the pasta and heat the dish just until all are heated through and the spinach wilts.\n\n![Front view Pumpkin Pasta with Spinach in bowls with fork](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pumpkin-Pasta-with-Spinach-in-bowls-with-fork-at-bottom.jpg)\n\nDish it up and top with roasted walnuts and grated Parmesan to make it pretty and to add extra flavor and texture. This pumpkin pasta dish would be an impressive vegetarian dish to serve at fall dinner parties but it’s also quick and easy enough for a fast weeknight meal.\n\nKids and adults will both love it. It’s also a tasty way to use up any extra canned pumpkin you might have leftover. This recipe will keep in the fridge for about 3 days.\n\nWays to use up leftover canned pumpkin\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you open up a new can of pumpkin for this recipe and need to use up the rest, here are a few [tips for using up leftover pumpkin](https://marisamoore.com/how-to-use-leftover-canned-pumpkin-puree/):\n\n1.  Double this pumpkin pasta sauce recipe. I’m a huge fan of cooking (and cleaning) once and eating twice! You won’t regret having an extra batch of this sauce ready to go in a month.\n2.  Make my easy [homemade pumpkin spice granola](https://marisamoore.com/healthy-pumpkin-spice-granola/)!\n3.  Stir extra pumpkin into oats or Greek yogurt.\n4.  [Feed the extra plain pumpkin to your dog](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/share-your-love-for-pumpkin-with-your-dog-this-fall/). She will love it as is or mixed in with her regular food.

For example, if you are using a lower sodium broth, add salt to suit your taste!\n*   Store the pasta sauce in a mason jar for a few days. It tastes better the day after you make it!\n*   Reheat the pumpkin sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Add warm broth to help thin it out if needed.\n\nCalories: 388kcal\n\n[Let us know](#comment) how it was!"

    "markdown": "# Nourishing Vegan Yellow Pumpkin Curry | Ambitious Kitchen\nI’m back again with another glorious recipe for #AKPumpkinWeek!\n\nYes, we’re going savory again and I’m not mad about it. I hope you aren’t either. This year I told myself that I wanted to incorporate more savory recipes into Ambitious Kitchen — you know delicious weeknight dinners you can always depend on to make you feel creative, healthy and satisfied.\n\nSo here we are with a beautiful chickpea vegan **yellow pumpkin curry**. My oh my is it GOOD. No wait, not just good, it’s DAMN good. FANTASTIC. CREAMY. COMFORTING. FULL OF UMAMI FLAVORS. EPIC. A MUST MAKE.\n\nYou get the point, right?\n\nWant more slow cooker recipes?\n------------------------------\n\nEnter your email to get one of our **BEST slow cooker dinner recipes** straight to your inbox each day for 7 days. Totally FREE!\n\n![pumpkin curry with rice and cilantro in a bowl with a spoon](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-5.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nIngredients in this pumpkin curry recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\nI was so thrilled when I first developed this vegan pumpkin curry recipe because of how nourishing it was. It’s full of anti-inflammatory ingredients, fiber, plant-based protein and just so happens to be both vegan and gluten free. Here’s what you need to make it:\n\n*   **Fresh cubed pumpkin:** instead of pumpkin puree in the curry we’re using fresh pumpkin! If you’ve never cooked a real pumpkin before, I suggest giving it a try. Check out my how to cook and dice a pumpkin tutorial [here](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-cook-a-pumpkin-homemade-pumpkin-puree/).\n*   **Chickpeas:** Always a favorite [legume](https://amzn.to/33WapUr) of mine because of their delicious flavor and ability to add plant based protein to any dish.\n*   **Lots of veggies:** Not only does this recipe involve pumpkin, but also cauliflower, carrots, red bell pepper, green onion and peas. So yes, it’s time to #eatyourveggies.\n*   **Light coconut milk:** I like using a [light canned coconut milk](https://amzn.to/3j5RYmA) in this dish because it’s not as rich as regular full fat coconut milk. There’s still a lot of coconut flavor though.\n*   **Vegetarian broth:** a little bit of [vegetable broth](https://amzn.to/3mPmvY9) adds the right amount of liquid to this curry recipe.\n*   **Soy sauce:** I recommend a low sodium [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/364GTyv) and be sure it’s gluten free if you want to keep this recipe gluten free. You can also use coconut aminos.\n*   **Peanut butter:** To bring the dish together, you must add a little [peanut butter](https://amzn.to/3kJ82er). It gives the recipe a unique umami flavor that helps to bring everything together. If you’re not into peanut butter, try cashew butter or even tahini.\n*   **The anti-inflammatory trio:** aka fresh garlic, ginger and [turmeric](https://amzn.to/33RpzKE). Not only do these three bring flavor to the dish but also help to boost your immune system with health benefits. Ginger is great for your digestive system, garlic helps fight bacteria, and turmeric provides an anti-inflammatory boost. I’m in loveeeee.\n*   **Cozy spices:** you’ll also be using [yellow curry powder](https://amzn.to/366ByqC) and a pinch of [cayenne pepper](https://amzn.to/2RVYwIv). I like to use curry powder instead of yellow curry paste for ease.\n*   **Brown rice:** we’re serving this delicious curry with a fragrant coconut [brown rice](https://amzn.to/3kJ8j0X).\n\n![yellow pumpkin curry with rice and cilantro in a bowl](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-4.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nWhat kind of pumpkin should you use for pumpkin curry?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI love to use pie pumpkins or a sugar pumpkin. No, you don’t cook the pumpkins you decorate for Halloween! Look for a brighter orange pumpkin that’s about 3-6 pounds — that’s when the flesh is the best for cooking. Really, any winter squash will work in this yellow curry recipe.\n\nCan’t find the perfect pumpkin?\n-------------------------------\n\nFeel free to use cubed sweet potato instead! You’ll add either to the recipe in the same way.\n\n![yellow pumpkin curry with rice in a bowl next to a fork](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-2.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nHow to make yellow pumpkin curry\n--------------------------------\n\n1.  **Make the brown rice.** Add your brown rice to a pan along with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil. Toast it over medium heat for 1 minute until fragrant. Next add 2 1/4 cups of water to a pot; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to sit in the pot with the lid on for 10 minutes so that the rice gets nice and fluffy.\n2.  **Cook the veggies.** Cook the ginger and garlic in a large pot with coconut oil for about 30 seconds, then add in all of your veggies except the bell pepper. Saute for about 5 minutes until cauliflower and pumpkin begin to get tender.\n3.  **Add spices & broth.** Next, add our spices and spices for 30 seconds before stirring in coconut milk, broth, peanut butter, soy sauce, salt and pepper. Allow to cook 5 minutes more, then stir in bell pepper and chickpeas and simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes.\n4.  **Don’t forget the greens!** Before serving, stir in frozen peas and simmer for an additional minute. Taste, and adjust seasonings as necessary.\n5.  **Garnish & serve.** Pour the curry into bowls or divide it into meal prep containers. Garnish with cilantro (or Thai basil if you’re feelin’ fancy) and chopped peanuts and serve with your rice!\n\nWhat to serve with vegan pumpkin curry\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis incredible yellow chickpea pumpkin curry recipe includes a fabulous coconut brown rice to pair with the curry, but you could always enjoy it with:\n\n*   [Fluffy quinoa](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-cook-the-best-fluffy-quinoa-plus-recipes/ \"How to Cook the Best Fluffy Quinoa (plus recipes!)\")\n*   [Cauliflower rice](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice/ \"How to Make Cauliflower Rice\")\n*   Or a side of naan to soak up all of that delicious yellow pumpkin curry sauce!\n\n![vegan pumpkin curry in a bowl with rice](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-3.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nHow to store & freeze pumpkin curry\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   **In the fridge:** store this yellow pumpkin curry in the refrigerator for up to 4 days in an airtight container.\n*   **In the freezer:** Be sure to not overcook the vegetables. Let the curry cool completely before transferring it to a freezer safe bag or container. Freeze for up to 2 months. I would not recommend freezing the pumpkin curry with rice. To reheat it, simply thaw the chickpea pumpkin curry in the refrigerator. While the curry is thawing, feel free to make rice, cauliflower rice or quinoa to serve with it. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave for 2 minutes until heated through.\n\nMore cozy recipes you’ll love\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Slow Cooker Black Bean Quinoa Pumpkin Chicken Chili](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/slow-cooker-black-bean-quinoa-pumpkin-chicken-chili/)\n*   [Spicy Black Bean Chicken Enchiladas with Pumpkin Sour Cream Sauce](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/spicy-black-bean-chicken-enchiladas-with-pumpkin-sour-cream-sauce-2/)\n*   [Healing Lemongrass Chickpea Thai Green Curry with Toasted Coconut Brown Rice](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healing-lemongrass-chickpea-thai-green-curry/)\n*   [Curry Roasted Cauliflower Sweet Potato Salad (whole30, vegan & gluten free)](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/curry-roasted-cauliflower-sweet-potato-salad/)\n*   [Thai Peanut Coconut Cauliflower Chickpea Curry](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/thai-peanut-coconut-cauliflower-chickpea-curry/)\n\nWant more slow cooker recipes?\n------------------------------\n\nEnter your email to get one of our **BEST slow cooker dinner recipes** straight to your inbox each day for 7 days.

Wash and chop fresh spinach, or thaw and drain frozen spinach.\n2.  **Cook the Pasta Shells**: Boil salted water and cook jumbo pasta shells until al dente. Drain and set aside.\n\n![Spinach and ricotta filling for shells.](https://saltedmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ricotta-Stuffed-Shells-2-2.jpg)\n\n3.  **Prepare the Filling**:\n    *   Heat olive oil over medium heat in a skillet. Sauté minced garlic until fragrant.\n    *   Add spinach and cook until wilted (fresh) or heated through (frozen). Season with salt and pepper.\n    *   Combine ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, egg, nutmeg (if using), and the spinach mixture. Mix well.\n4.  **Assemble the Dish**:\n    *   Spread marinara sauce at the bottom of a baking dish.\n    *   Stuff pasta shells with the cheese and spinach mixture. Place seam side up in the dish.\n    *   Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the stuffed shells. Sprinkle extra mozzarella on top.\n5.  **Bake**:\n    *   Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.\n    *   Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.\n\n💡 **Chef's Guide: Expert Tips**\n--------------------------------\n\nDrawing from a decade in Michelin-starred kitchens and Cordon Bleu training, here are my top tips for recipe success.\n\n*   **Perfectly Cooked Shells**: Ensure pasta shells are cooked al dente to avoid becoming mushy during baking.\n*   **Squeeze Spinach Well**: If using frozen spinach, make sure to squeeze out all excess water to prevent the filling from becoming too watery.\n*   **Layering Sauce**: A layer of marinara sauce at the bottom prevents the shells from sticking and adds extra flavor.\n*   **Extra Cheese**: For an extra cheesy top, add mozzarella or even provolone cheese before the final 10 minutes of baking.\n\n📖 Substitutions & Variations\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **Cheese Variations**: Substitute ricotta with mascarpone or add provolone for extra cheesiness.\n*   **Gluten-Free**: Use gluten-free pasta shells to make the dish suitable for gluten-intolerant guests.\n*   **Spice it Up**: Add red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture or sprinkle on top before baking for some heat.\n*   **Herb Substitutions**: Swap basil or parsley with oregano or thyme for a different herbal note.\n\n🍯 **Storing and reheating leftovers**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   **Fridge:** Store any leftover ricotta stuffed shells in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n*   **Freezer:** Place the stuffed shells in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them individually before transferring them to a freezer-safe container or bag. They can be frozen for up to 2-3 months.\n*   **Reheat:**\n    *   **From the fridge**: Reheat in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 20 minutes or until heated through.\n    *   **From the freezer**: If frozen, thaw overnight in the fridge before reheating as described above.\n\n❓**Recipe FAQ's**\n-----------------\n\n**Can I make this dish ahead of time?**\n\nAbsolutely! You can prepare the stuffed shells, refrigerate them, and bake just before serving.  \n\n**Can I use other types of cheese besides ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan?**\n\nYes, you can experiment with other cheeses. Fontina or provolone can be a good substitute for mozzarella, and cottage cheese or mascarpone can be used instead of ricotta.  \n\n**I'm gluten-free. Can I use gluten-free pasta shells for this recipe?**\n\nAbsolutely! Many gluten-free jumbo pasta shell options are available in stores. Just ensure you follow the cooking instructions on the package, as gluten-free pasta can have a different cooking time and texture.  \n\n**Can I add meat to this dish?**\n\nYes, ground beef, Italian sausage, or even ground turkey can be cooked and mixed into the marinara sauce or combined with the cheese filling for a meaty variation.  \n\n**Try these easy easy sauces with your ricotta stuffed shells:**\n\n*   [\n    \n    The Best Pomodoro Sauce\n    \n    ](https://saltedmint.com/pomodoro-sauce/)\n*   [\n    \n    Quick and Easy Roasted Red Pepper Sauce\n    \n    ](https://saltedmint.com/really-useful-roasted-red-pepper-sauce/)\n*   [\n    \n    The BEST Authentic Arrabbiata Sauce\n    \n    ](https://saltedmint.com/homemade-store-cupboard-classic-arrabbiata-sauce/)\n\nDid you make these **ricotta stuffed shells**?

    "markdown": "# Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full\n![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-42.jpg)\n\nAnother healthy, green recipe for January! Although, I feel like once it hits the second week, we all stop talking about our resolutions and whatnot. But I actually just wrote [an article for MindBodyGreen](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-28344/the-everyday-detox-what-food-to-incorporate-so-youre-always-effortlessly-cleans.html?utm_content=buffer88f32&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer) about “detoxing” and what it really means. (Although please note that I am NOT a health professional, just a humble nutrition student! Always consult your doctor before starting any dietary changes!)\n\nDetoxing was in vogue a few year ago, but now it’s kind of lost its steam as body positivity has come more into the light. Which I want to address – **you can be body positive AND want to eat healthier**. One does not preclude the other. And I am all for body positivity AND eating healthy. But it’s important to mention that TRUE detoxing happens in the body already – your body actually has a very efficient system for removing toxins. A juice cleanse is not a real detox. However, we CAN make it easier for our bodies by eating the nutrients it needs for these detoxifying processes to happen – i.e. foods that aid in digestion and elimination, foods that promote liver health, etc. But let me stress again that the foods are NOT the detox themselves – they’re just helping the body do what it already does.\n\n[  \n![](https://www.awltovhc.com/image-100239365-13925905)](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100239365-13925905)\n\nEnter this kale detox salad. The overarching principle behind this salad being a “detox” salad is that it’s super green, which means chlorophyll. I love talking about chlorophyll as a detoxifying agent because it’s one of the best things you can have for your liver. Without getting too science-y, chlorophyll helps increase the activity of Phase II Biotransformation Enzymes, which have been shown to help remove toxins and carcinogens from the body. So basically, eat green and help your liver.\n\nBut I had to make this salad delicious, because what’s the point of eating it if it’s not delicious?! It’s got roasted potatoes and carrots, brown rice for fiber, chickpeas (of course), and lacinato kale – all topped with a deliciously _chloro-filled_ (see what I did there!?) green pesto. It’s delicious, AND good for your bod! I hope you all love it!\n\n![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-41.jpg)![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-38.jpg)![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-43.jpg)![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-25.jpg)\n\n![Detox Kale Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-48-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://wellandfull.com/wprm_print/kale-detox-salad-w-pesto)\n\nKale Detox Salad w/ Pesto\n-------------------------\n\nThis kale detox salad is the perfect meal for a cleanse, made with whole, real ingredients. Made with a mouthwatering carrot top pesto and roasted vegetables.\n\nPrep Time 15 minutes\n\nCook Time 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time 1 hour\n\nServings 2 as a Main, 3-4 as a Side\n\n#### Carrot Top Pesto\n\n*   Tops of 1 Bunch Carrots\n*   1/4 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n*   1/4 Tsp Salt\n*   1/4 Tsp Pepper\n*   Juice from 1/2 a Lemon\n\n#### Roasted Veg\n\n*   1 Lb Fingerling Potatoes cut into rounds\n*   3-4 Large Purple Carrots cut into rounds\n*   1 15 oz Can Chickpeas drained and rinsed\n*   A Generous Drizzle of Olive Oil\n*   1 Tsp Salt\n*   1 Tsp Pepper\n*   1 Tsp Dried Parsley\n*   1 Tsp Dried Basil\n*   1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder\n*   Few Sprinkles of Dried Thyme\n\n#### The Rest of the Salad\n\n*   A Few Handfuls Lacinato Kale Sliced Thin\n*   1 Cup Cooked Brown Rice\n*   Sliced Jalapeño if desired\n*   Sesame Seeds if desired\n\n*   Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.\n    \n*   Prep vegetables – wash and dry carrots and potatoes. Cut both into rounds (disks), about 1/4 inch thick.\n    \n*   In a bowl, combine chopped potatoes, carrots, and chickpeas. Add in olive oil and spices, and mix well until everything is evenly coated.\n    \n*   On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake vegetables + chickpeas for 45-50 minutes. When they’re done cooking, remove from oven and let cool.\n    \n*   While vegetables are cooking, make pesto – combine all ingredients into a food processor and process on high until a slightly smooth pesto is formed.\n    \n*   In a bowl, mix thinly sliced lacinato kale and pesto until kale is evenly covered. Then, add in roasted vegetables + chickpeas and brown rice. Mix well until everything is evenly combined.\n    \n*   Serve in bowls and top with sesame seeds.\n    \n*   Enjoy!\n    \n\nIf you can’t find lacinato (Tuscan) kale, any other hardy green will do – like chard, regular kale, or collard greens.\n\nAlso, for this recipe I use my [Cuisinart Food Processor](https://amzn.to/2S0uDWo) (affiliate link). This food processor is great and I use it in my kitchen multiple times a week. I highly recommend it!\n\n![Kale Detox Salad | Well and Full | #vegan #recipe #detox #cleanse](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kale-Detox-Salad-copy-2.jpg)\n\n![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-47.jpg)\n\nQuote of the Day:\n-----------------\n\n> _Be yourself; everyone else is already taken._\n> \n> – Oscar Wilde"

    "markdown": "# Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash - Dishing Out Health\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

They only take minutes to prepare and the bold flavors of the parmesan cheese and pesto are sure to win you over!**_ \n\n[![Parmesan Pesto Roasted tri-colored baby Potatoes on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto on the plate.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Photo-680x967.jpg)](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Photo.jpg)\n\n**Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes Recipe Video**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThese Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes were a recipe I first tested out back in early August. Bad move. It was almost 100 degrees that day and cranking the oven to 400 degrees was not the smartest thing I’ve done.\n\nHowever, when they came out of the oven all crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and full of pesto flavor, I didn’t regret it for a second.\n\n[![Closeup photo ofParmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Photograph-680x1013.jpg)](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Photograph.jpg)\n\nRoasted potatoes is probably something that isn’t new to you. Although, if it is, you’ll be pleasantly surprised how delicious they are when prepared this way.\n\nA basic roasting method for potatoes is to cut them into a large dice, toss them together with olive oil, salt and pepper and roast them in the oven at around 400-425° F.\n\nIf you’re looking for an even easier way to do it and one with extra flavor, then I highly suggest giving this parmesan pesto version a try.\n\nTo make this recipe as easy as possible I used a bag of tricolored baby potatoes. The bags of potatoes generally include red, white and yellow potatoes.\n\nSometimes purple ones are included as well, like the bag I used. The potatoes have thin skin, which is perfect for roasting because the skin will crisp quickly. \n\n[![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes on gray plate with small bowl of pesto.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Picture-680x978.jpg)](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Picture.jpg)\n\n**Can I Use a Different Variety of Potato?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that bags of tricolored baby potatoes aren’t the most economical. If you aren’t interested in the having the different colors or don’t mind doing a little more prep, you can definitely substitute them.\n\nI recommend substituting with Yukon Gold or red potatoes. They have thin skins and a creamier flesh, which will give you a great roasted potato.\n\nWhether your doing the dicing on your own or using a bag of baby potatoes, it’s important that they’re as close to the same size as possible. This will ensure they are all cooked properly and you don’t wind up with some that are mushy and others that are still raw. \n\n**How to Prep Potatoes for Roasting**\n-------------------------------------\n\nPrepping the potatoes for roasting is beyond easy and should only take about 5 minutes assuming you’re using potatoes. If you aren’t it will probably take 10 minutes, which is still nothing when it comes to prep time.\n\n1.  Rinse the potatoes under cold water and scrub off any dirt. \n2.  If using baby potatoes cut the larger ones in half so the potatoes are approximately all the same size.\n3.  Spray a rimmed sheet pan with cooking spray. The pan can be lined with foil if you want less cleanup. Lay the potatoes out on the prepared pan, spoon the pesto onto the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Toss everything together with your hands until all of the potatoes are coated in the pesto.\n4.  Grate the parmesan cheese, but don’t add it to the potatoes at this point. It will be added to them during the last 2 minutes of roasting.\n\nAside from the pesto and parmesan cheese, there’s one more magical ingredients that’s not to be skipped. Fresh squeezed lemon juice. The lemon juice gets squeezed over the potatoes after they’ve finished roasting in the oven.\n\nIt adds a wonderful bright, fresh flavor that goes perfect with the pesto and parmesan. I did the same pesto lemon combination in this popular [**Grilled Chicken and Asparagus Pesto Pasta**](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-chicken-asparagus-pesto-pasta/) and it’s wonderful! \n\n[![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes drizzled with pesto on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Pic-680x1010.jpg)](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Pic.jpg)\n\n**What To Serve With Pesto Potatoes?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**More Potato Recipes**\n-----------------------\n\n*   [Chimichurri Potato Salad](https://reciperunner.com/chimichurri-potato-salad/)\n*   [Skinny Cheesy Potato Casserole](https://reciperunner.com/skinny-cheesy-potato-casserole/)\n*   [Cheesy Chipotle Lime Twice Baked Sweet Potatoes](https://reciperunner.com/cheesy-chipotle-lime-twice-baked-sweet-potatoes/)\n*   [Everything Bagel Roasted Potatoes](https://reciperunner.com/everything-bagel-roasted-potatoes/)\n*   [Herb Roasted Potatoes with Blue Cheese](https://reciperunner.com/herb-roasted-potatoes-with-blue-cheese/)\n\n#### **_Did you make these Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes?

On top of that I have already planted a bunch of my container pots which I had to pull indoors. The weather has been nice around here so this little burst of cold has been a real bummer.\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-1.jpg)\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-5.jpg)\n\nWith a chill in the air this past weekend it gave me a chance to catch up on some indoor projects since I’ve been outdoors a lot lately and work on my menu planning for the next couple weeks. Oddly I find menu planning fun. I know some people that dread it but I enjoy it. I’ve got it down to almost to a science although Mr. Mother Thyme thinks I obsess over it a little too much. I love putting together menus with a combination of some of my go-to family favorites along with some new recipes I like to try that I find on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/motherthyme) or in my cookbooks. Some weeks I also have a night or two during the week that are deemed for recipe testing if I have dinner ideas I’ve come up with.\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-13.jpg)\n\nOne of my favorite go-to recipes this is on our dinner menu a lot is Italian sausage with peppers and onions. I usually make it with chopped Italian sausage mixed with tender and juicy peppers and onions. My secret to this delicious recipe is adding a splash of balsamic vinegar at the end and cranking up the heat to really infuse the flavors. It can be served over rice, noodles or I like it alone. It’s so good!\n\nSo I took all the yumminess of that dish and combined it into these amazing peppers that are not only stuffed but roasted too. Yes, roasted! Roasting the peppers make them fork tender to eat and really brings out the sweetness of the peppers. If you love stuffed peppers and never had them roasted it’s almost life changing. You may never want to make stuffed peppers any other way again.\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-2.jpg)\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-10.jpg)\n\nAnd if this recipe couldn’t get any better, it’s low carb too! I omitted the rice for a healthier low carb option but trust me you won’t miss it if you usually like stuffed peppers with rice. As much as I like chicken and turkey Italian sausage for some reason I prefer using regular pork sausage for this recipe but you could totally use Italian turkey or chicken sausage if you really wanted to be real good.\n\nThe finishing touch to this recipe is the Balsamic Glaze. It adds the final touch to this delicious recipe. I like to garnish it with more rosemary and basil for a super yummy and flavorful dinner.\n\n**Have you tried this recipe?

    "markdown": "# Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken and Rice Recipe - Pinch of Yum\nGrilled marinated chicken, fluffy rice, and excessive handfuls of mint and cilantro, finished off with a generous drizzling of big and flavorful creamy coconut lime sauce.\n\nThe picture I’m going to paint for you today starts with grilled marinated chicken, fluffy rice, and excessive handfuls of mint and cilantro, and it finishes with a generous drizzling of creamy coconut lime sauce that is so big and so flavorful that you cannot be unchanged by it.\n\nYou know I’m not always the biggest fan of chicken but THIS. This sauce-soaked, herb-loaded wonder is exactly the kind of chicken I like.\n\n![Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken and rice with bite on fork.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-5.jpg)\n\nIt’s the time of year when I start to build my meal plans around getting outdoors as much as possible. I know what’s coming (WINTER) and I know how much I will be outside (HARDLY AT ALL) so I’m doing my best to really lean into those summer flavors and the kinds of meals that naturally bring you outside into the sun. And if those meals can put loads of fresh summer herbs to good use, double win.\n\nFor that reason this recipe serves two purposes:\n\n*   Getting you outside into the sun / fresh air to boost the mood a bit.\n*   Giving you the foundation for all good things: that zingy, salty, herb-loaded coconut lime sauce.\n\n![Coconut lime sauce in a food processor.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-1.jpg)\n\nCoconut milk, lime juice, lime zest, fish sauce, cilantro mint garlic oh my. This. Sauce. Is. So. Good.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that between recipe development, photos, and video, the three people working on this recipe (working out of three separate locations) each ended up with slightly different looking sauces. One thin, one medium, one thick.\n\nThe lesson: coconut milk can vary greatly from can to can and brand to brand, and how much lime sauce you add (and whether you measure or just squeeze) can also impact the final coconut lime sauce texture. I’d recommend just starting with what’s written and then adjust as needed.\n\n![Grilling chicken on a grill.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-2.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the day, chicken and rice never fails, but it EXTRA never fails us when it’s serves as a blank canvas to holds all the flavors of that cool, creamy sauce.\n\nA little char on the chicken, a fresh squeeze of lime, hot sticky rice, and a heavy dousing of puckery coconut lime sauce. It’s creamy and summery, bright and fresh, and deeply filling and satisfying.\n\nBring it on.\n\n![Coconut Lime Grilled chicken with rice on a plate.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-4.jpg)\n\nCheck Out Our Video For How To Make Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Click here to see the step-by-step web story instructions for this recipe!](https://pinchofyum.com/web-stories/coconut-lime-grilled-chicken)\n\n_The coconut lime sauce (and the crown jewel!) of this recipe was inspired by the sauce in [this Forbidden Rice salad recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/37302-forbidden-rice-salad-with-thai-coconut-lime-dressing) from Food52. Not one but two people on our team made it and convinced me I needed to try it_! _They were not wrong. The Food52 recipe was authored by Asha Loupy. You can find her website [here](http://fromheadtotable.com/) and her Instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/fromheadtotable/)._\n\n[Print](https://pinchofyum.com/coconut-lime-grilled-chicken-and-rice/print/63743)\n\n### Description\n\nCoconut Lime Grilled Chicken Bowls! Grilled marinated chicken, fluffy rice, and excessive handfuls of mint and cilantro, finished off with a generous drizzling of big and flavorful creamy coconut lime sauce.\n\n* * *\n\n**Coconut Lime Sauce**\n\n*   juice and zest of 2-3 **limes** (about 1/4 cup)\n*   2 tablespoons **fish sauce**\n*   1/4 cup **full fat coconut milk** (solid / creamy stuff in a can for a creamier sauce)\n*   1 tablespoon **brown sugar**\n*   1 tablespoon **lemongrass paste** (or fresh grated lemongrass, if you have access!)\n*   half a **jalapeño pepper**, ribs and seeds removed\n*   1 clove **garlic**\n*   small bundle of **fresh cilantro**\n*   small bundle of **fresh mint**\n\n**Everything Else**\n\n*   1 lb. **boneless skinless chicken thighs**\n*   1 1/2 cups **rice**, uncooked\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n* * *\n\n1.  Sauce: Pulse all sauce ingredients together in a food processor until smooth.\n    \n2.  Chicken: Pour about half of the sauce over the chicken and allow to marinade for 30 minutes. _(This 30 minute wait time is a good time to make some rice!)_\n    \n3.  Chicken: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high heat. Cook the chicken on both sides until browned and fully cooked, about 4 minutes per side. Allow to rest for a few minutes.\n    \n4.  To finish: Serve grilled chicken with rice and vegetables, and drizzle with remaining sauce.\n    \n\n### Notes\n\n**Sauce Consistency:** The thickness and creaminess of your sauce is pretty dependent on the nature of your coconut milk. There can be so much variance between brands and even just from can to can, which you can see between our Instagram story videos, our photos, and our step by step videos. The good news is that regardless of texture, the sauce tastes \\*delicious.\\* And you can always boost the creaminess by adding more of the top / solid part of the coconut milk into the sauce.\n\n**Vegetarian / Vegan:** Sub 1-2 tablespoons soy sauce for fish sauce, and serve on pan-fried tofu!\n\n*   Prep Time: 20 minutes\n*   Cook Time: 20 minutes\n*   Category: Dinner\n*   Method: Grilling\n*   Cuisine: Thai-Inspired\n\nKeywords: grilled chicken, grilling recipe, grilled chicken thighs, coconut sauce, coconut chicken, healthy summer dinner, rice bowls\n\n* * *\n\nOne More Thing!\n---------------\n\nThis recipe is part of our collection of **[delicious rice recipes](https://pinchofyum.com/delicious-rice-recipes)**.

I have a batch of cooked quinoa in my fridge at all times and use it in meatless tacos, enchiladas, and salads. It's a healthy protein source and combined with beans and vegetables makes for a delicious and filling dish.\n\nThis Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad is a family favorite right now! It's simple to make and I can store it in individual containers for a healthy lunch throughout the week or as a side dish to grilled chicken. It's wonderful in lettuce cups or tossed with chopped kale too!\n\nIngredients:\n------------\n\n![sweet potatoes, corn, black beans, red onion and quinoa in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-1.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\n*   **sweet potatoes** - The star of this recipe! I cut the potatoes into chunks, toss them with oil and spices, and roast them.\n*   **quinoa** - You can use my recipe for cooking [quinoa in the Instant Pot](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/) (it takes only 1 minute of cooking time!!) or make it on the stove.\n*   **black beans** - You will need one can or 1 and ½ cups of home-cooked beans.\n*   **whole kernel corn** - You will need one can. Drain the water and rinse the corn before adding to the salad. Fresh is great too and can be roasted along with the potatoes! I do not like frozen and thawed-out corn in this salad\n*   **onion** - I prefer red onion for salads. You can use sweet or yellow, whatever you prefer.\n*   **olive oil** - It's a base for the dressing. Use avocado oil, if you prefer.\n*   **lime juice** - Freshly squeezed juice is best here.\n*   **spices** - cumin, paprika, salt, pepper\n*   **garlic** - I prefer fresh, minced garlic. Use garlic powder if you are in a pinch.\n*   **Tajin seasoning** - This ingredient is not necessary but definitely recommended. It is made with ground dried chile peppers, dehydrated lime, and sea salt.\n\nThis healthy and filling salad is very easy to make. It's perfect for meal prep lunch or dinners, when you want something filling but healthy. Here is how to make it:\n\n*   Start with roasting sweet potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, and cumin. They will have a delicious Mexican flair!\n*   Add one can of rinsed and drained black beans, one can of drained whole kernel corn, chopped red onion, and 2 cups of [cooked quinoa](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/).\n*   The dressing is as simple as the salad! Whisk together olive oil, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, and Tajin seasoning. Pour over salad and toss together.\n\n![roasted sweet potato salad in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-5.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHow to roast sweet potatoes for this salad?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRoasting sweet potatoes for a salad or as a simple side dish to your meal prep dishes is very easy. Simply peel potatoes and cut them into cubes, no bigger than ½\". Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and ground cumin. Roast at 400 degrees F for 20 to 23 minutes. Use right away or cool and add to your salad. You can also store them in a container with a lid in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n\nThe dressing:\n-------------\n\nI have plenty of salad recipes with creamy dressings, either mayo-based or healthier with sour cream. For this sweet potato salad, I decided to use a simple olive oil vinaigrette that perfectly complements the potatoes, beans, and quinoa. Mix 4 to 5 tablespoons of olive oil with lime juice, salt, cumin, paprika, minced garlic, and tajin seasoning. The last one is optional but I love it in this dressing and even add a little more sprinkled over each serving.\n\n![sweet potato quinoa salad in two bowls with lime wedges](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-4.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHelpful Tips!\n-------------\n\n*   I love this salad with slightly warm quinoa and warm roasted potatoes but it is absolutely delicious chilled in the fridge and can be divided into serving containers.\n*   If using fresh corn, add it to roasting potatoes. It will give it an even more delicious flavor.\n*   If you don't like raw red onion, skip it.

[This is olive oil](https://amzn.to/3hwcVGc) is generally considered the gold standard for affordable but excellent.  \n**Parmesan:** Freshly grated parmesan is preferred here because it melts and browns extremely nicely, but the bagged pre-shredded stuff works just fine.  \n**Salt & pepper:** You don’t really need more seasoning than a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, but if you’d like to experiment with flavors, try adding a little garlic powder or Italian seasoning.\n\n![Parmesan being sprinkled on zucchini slices before baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo.jpg)\n\nHow to Make the Best Baked Parmesan Zucchini (Tips and Tricks)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Be strategic about how you slice your zucchini:** Prefer softer zucchini? Slice it into thinner rounds, around 1/4-inch thick. Like your baked zucchini on the firmer side? Cut it thicker, closer to 1/2-inch.  \n**Don’t skip the broiler:** The final step in this recipe after roasting your zucchini is to switch on the broiler and broil the rounds for just a couple minutes. This makes the cheese extra toasty and delicious. But keep a close eye on your zucchini while the broiler is going. Food under the broiler can burn very quickly, so you never want to leave your broiler unattended.\n\n![Collage photo of parmesan zucchini before and after baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-picture.jpg)\n\n### What to Serve With Cheesy Roasted Zucchini?\n\nThese bites are great alongside almost anything, particularly simple lunch sandwiches or:\n\n*   [Tomato Soup](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-tomato-soup-recipe-for-two/)\n*   [Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwiches](https://bakingmischief.com/pesto-grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Sausage Pasta](https://bakingmischief.com/creamy-sausage-pasta/)\n*   [Buttered Noodles](https://bakingmischief.com/buttered-noodles/)\n\n**Bonus Tip:** _If you have leftover [Pizza Sauce](https://bakingmischief.com/best-homemade-pizza-sauce/) or marinara sauce in your fridge, serve these as a snack and use them for dipping.

    "markdown": "# Crisp Gnocchi With Brussels Sprouts and Brown Butter Recipe\nTotal Time\n\n20 minutes\n\nRating\n\n5(18,388)\n\nNotes\n\n[Read community notes](#notes_section)\n\nFor a fantastic meal that can be ready in 20 minutes, toss together seared gnocchi and sautéed brussels sprouts with lemon zest, red-pepper flakes and brown butter. The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.\n\n* * *\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nYield:4 servings\n\n*   1pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)\n*   1lemon\n*   4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n*   Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper\n*   ½teaspoon red-pepper flakes\n*   1(18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi\n*   6tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces\n*   ½teaspoon honey\n*   Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving\n\n[Ingredient Substitution Guide](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/79-substitutions-for-cooking)\n\n##### Nutritional analysis per serving (4 servings)\n\n526 calories; 33 grams fat; 13 grams saturated fat; 0 grams trans fat; 15 grams monounsaturated fat; 2 grams polyunsaturated fat; 52 grams carbohydrates; 8 grams dietary fiber; 5 grams sugars; 11 grams protein; 697 milligrams sodium\n\nNote: The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)\n    \n2.  In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.\n    \n3.  In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.\n    \n\nRatings\n-------\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\nor to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\n### Private Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n-------------\n\nDear NY Times stylist, thanks for using my father's, Michael Lax's, teak handled, cast iron, skillet, the large one, by Copco. Great skillets, but note, if you find one, due to the selection of the teak handle, you cannot put them into the oven. My father was an industrial designer and designed/started Copco. The NYTimes ran his obituary in 1999. He was a diehard New Yorker, born and raised in the west village on Morton Street and he went to Alfred University in the Industrial Ceramics dept.\n\nRather than honey, I substituted a splash of aged balsamic for sweetness as well as a touch of acidity.\n\nThis works great with the Trader Joe’s Cauliflower Gnocchi too.\n\nThis was so good! We roasted the brussel sprouts to make them really crispy and then added them to the skillet along with a shallot and chopped garlic after crisping the gnocchi. Also topped it with a dollop of lemon zested garlic ricotta to finish. It was over the top delicious!\n\nI guess I'm the only whose brussel sprouts didn't cook in five minutes. I tried to follow this using the timing but ended up with hard brussel sprouts so I had to add liquid and let it simmer\n\nFabulous! Life required that I roast the sprouts. I prepared as directed with lemon zest and red pepper flakes. My helper popped them in oven at 425. They cooked for 25 minutes to perfection. By time I got home, I had enough time to prepare gnocchi as directed before roasting was complete.. I had to make 2 batches for crowd I was feeding - first one used 6 T butter, second batch 4T. Four was plenty. Used balsamic instead of honey. Will make again and again !\n\nI have done this with pancetta rather than butter. It's fantastic, and it also would be almost as good with butter..\n\nMade this into a true 20 min meal by baking the Brussels sprouts in the oven (15 min at 450 degrees) while simultaneously cooking the gnocchi on the stove top. Mixed them together on stovetop at the very end as recipe says. Also, 6 tablespoons of butter seems crazy - I added 2 and my gnocchi were deliciously buttery and crispy! Quick and easy, would definitely make again.\n\nMy kids only dabbled in the brussels sprouts (understandable, and: more veggies for me!), but mainly stuck to the gnocchi. My wife - hates \"cabbage-y\" things - was astonished by how good it was. In my family, this counts as a success. However: - This took much more than 20 minutes, more like 40. - I rounded up on the portions (I live in Europe and buy in grams). Nonetheless, there weren't any leftovers. Feeds four? Feeds two adults and two toddlers. Well.\n\nIf the gnocchi immediately sticking to the pan like glue freaks you out like it did me the first time, don’t worry. It will release once the butter melts (and with a nice golden brown crust). Do make sure they are completely broken up before they go into the pan though.\n\nFollowed exactly, except my sprouts were big so I quartered them. It took more than 2 min for the butter to brown but once it did, magic. Don’t skimp on the lemon zest and don’t be afraid of some bigger chunks of it after chopping — fried in the butter and honey they are a delightful contrast to the rest of the dish. Don’t overdo the Parmesan at the end, a light sprinkle does the job.\n\nWhy decide between Pancetta and Butter when you can have both?!? One of the best things I’ve cooked at home in recent memory.\n\nCooked this last night and it was delicious. Next time I would double the Brussels sprouts and roast them instead of frying (my pan isn't big enough to properly fry that many sprouts!), try reducing the amount of butter by half (there was so much butter pooled at the bottom of my bowl when we finished it off!), then add the roasted sprouts into the pan to toss with the gnocchi at the very end. We didn't add the Parm because I was lazy and didn't bring it to the table, and didn't miss it one bit!\n\nI think some aged balsamic might be a good substitute for the honey.\n\nWe loved this one! I think the secret is a cast-iron skillet. This was the first recipe I’ve ever attempted in my cast-iron, and I am now a believer! I would probably throw in some bacon next time. And a handful of toasted pinenuts.\n\nLove this recipe! I did sub the honey and red pepper flakes with Mike's Hot Honey and added some rotisserie chicken to the mix.\n\nUsed pancetta (why not?) and was somehow lacking lemon, so used orange zest instead, which was honestly fantastic. What a lovely, tasty one skillet meal.\n\nThis is one of our absolute favorites! I use Brussels Sprouts and cut down the butter a bit. A regular in our house and often doubled (even for only 2 people) to have plenty of leftovers.\n\nDidn’t expect this to work so well but it was superb - like others, perhaps doesn’t need quite that much butter… Brussels Sprouts in a fry pan - awesome trick… Gnocchi in a frypan - awesome trick…. Put them together - amazing meal!\n\nI used chickpea gnocchi for added protein- A delicious dish!\n\nOven roasted the sprouts Halved the butter Added drizzle of lemon juice to the gnocchi at the end\n\nI think I messed this up. It was delicious but messy and super gooey. The brussel sprouts were fantastic but the gnocchi were gooey. Maybe I got the wrong kind? Definitely would try again and see about adding less butter. I was left with lots of extra butter in the pan. I also added mushrooms cause I love them but they probably added extra liquid.\n\nDelicious! For those saying the brussels don’t cook, cover them first while they’re browning. We added a bit of pancetta since we had it and needed to use it up. And why not. Just cooked that first then added the brussels and carried on. Decrease the salt if you do this. We also added more red pepper since we like it. This was absolutely amazing. Half way through eating, we decided to also squeeze some lemon on some of it, and it really gave a nice lift. Make this!\n\nI'm obsessed with this recipe! Sometimes I substitute tteok (Korean rice cakes) for the gnocchi and it takes it to a whole different level.\n\nI added hot Italian sausage and nixed the lemon zest. Hot honey and a drizzle of balsamic glaze at the end and it was absolutely delicious! The timing definitely took a bit longer than what the recipe suggests, but definitely worth it!\n\nLove it, we have made this 50+ times with the following changes: 1. Roast sprouts @ 425F. The listed method is not enough time to cook all the way thru. Add them after browning butter. Protip: Preheat your baking pan! They should sizzle on contact 2. Use 4-5 tbsp butter instead of 6 3. Add 2-3 cloves minced garlic 1 min from done 4. Sub honey for hot honey\n\nThis has become a staple in our house. We have made it over 50 times at this point. But we have evolved the recipe into our own so here are my recommendations: 1. Roast your brussels sprouts cut side down @ 425F instead of sautéing. The listed method is not enough time to cook all them all the way through. Toss them in after you brown the butter. Protip: preheat your baking pan, sprouts should sizzle immediately on contact 2. Let the gnocchi get browned on all sides 3. Add a couple cloves of min\n\nVery surprised by all the positive reviews. Both dry (notice lack of any sauce other than…butter) and extremely greasy (see previous note re: butter). If I try again might boil the gnocchi prior to frying to see if it adds some moisture, halve the butter, and double the ratio of Brussels to gnocchi.\n\nThis dish had no right to be as delicious as it was! The ingredients are simple and so are the techniques you use. It doesn't all make sense on paper but it comes together wonderfully! Crunchy gnocchi and brussel sprouts. Slightly hot from the red pepper flakes, a little sweet from the honey, and with the slightest hint of lemon. And the parmesan at the end! So subtle but so good! Definitely making this again and can't wait to try with the different variations of cruciferous vegetables!\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you."

And I have a feeling this salad is going to be your next favourite. Because who doesn’t love Balsamic Chicken AND Caprese _in the one sentence?_\n\n### How To Make The Best Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad\n\nTraditionally, Caprese salads do not contain any balsamic vinegar OR avocados or chicken, but today, however, that has changed to make way for this bowl of epic flavours.\n\nTaking some inspiration from this [Balsamic Glazed Caprese Chicken](https://cafedelites.com/balsamic-glazed-caprese-chicken-recipe/), you’re first going to marinade your chicken:\n\n*   You only need to use 4 tablespoons of the balsamic marinade.\n*   You’re going to reserve the **remaining dressing to use later in the refrigerator!** _No_, we don’t use the OLD marinade as a dressing. We use the _FRESH UNTOUCHED_ marinade.\n*   Then, you’re going to sear said chicken until crispy on the edges and golden. For this salad I used boneless, skinless thighs, BUT you can use breasts if you wish.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nAfter that, the salad comes together _so FAST_.

Fall comfort food at it’s best!\n\nwhy these pumpkin ravioli are the BEST\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   Homemade pumpkin ravioli are easy and fun to make plus they are super impressive and .. you know.. there’s all that street cred 🙂\n*   Tender pumpkin ravioli simmered in sage butter topped off with apple bites and toasted pecans. So much savoy goodness on one plate!\n*   Easy to make double batches of pumpkin ravioli so you have plenty in the freezer for a quick meal or to share with friends.\n\nTo make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, you will need:\n\n*   All purpose flour\n*   Eggs\n*   Olive oil\n*   Ricotta cheese\n*   Pumpkin puree\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Seasonings\n*   Butter\n*   Fresh sage leaves\n*   Apple\n*   Apple cider vinegar\n*   Walnuts\n\n**how do you make pumpkin ravioli?**\n------------------------------------\n\nEasy! To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to

Easier to make than you might think, these homemade pumpkin ravioli are tender and full of pumpkin flavor. Made with pumpkin puree, ricotta cheese, fall seasonings and an easy ravioli dough recipe, these pumpkin ravioli are then simmered in a rich sage butter and topped with apples and walnuts.\n\n#### Ravioli Dough\n\n*   3 cups all purpose flour\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   3 large eggs\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   2 teaspoons water\n*   extra flour for rolling\n\n#### Pumpkin Ravoili Filling\n\n*   1 cup ricotta cheese\n*   3/4 cup pumpkin puree\n*   1/3 cup parmesan cheese grated\n*   1 large egg\n*   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n*   1/2 teaspoon allspice\n*   2 tablespoons brown sugar\n*   1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   1/4 teaspoon pepper\n*   non-stick cooking spray\n\n#### Apple Sage Butter\n\n*   1/2 cup butter\n*   16-18 fresh sage leaves chopped or ripped\n*   1 apple - gala or honeycrisp peeled, cored, diced\n*   1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n*   1/4 cup walnuts chopped\n\n#### To Make the Ravioli Dough\n\n*   Easy! To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough. On your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine.  Now, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.  Next, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano. \n    \n*   Now, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture and once the dough starts to look like ... dough .... start kneeding it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. Then form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.  \n    \n\n#### To Make the Pumpkin Ravioli Filling\n\n*   After that hour has passed and you are ready to make your pumpkin ravioli, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. Add in the parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside. \n    \n\n#### To Make the Pumpkin Ravioli\n\n*   On your countertop or a large cutting board, unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide. \n    \n*   At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray. Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well. Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells. Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli. Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed. Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray. The ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n    \n*   Add your fresh ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n    \n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don't want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME.

I began by oven roasting carrots with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt and pepper.\n\n![hand adding salt to carrots on a sheet pan.](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/glazed-roasted-carrots-704x1024.jpg)\n\n2.  While the carrots roasted, in another pan I sautéd pecans with a bit more butter, brown sugar, maple syrup (for that great fall flavor) and a sprinkle of flaked sea salt.\n\n![carrots on a sheet pan with seasonings and butter. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/roasted-glazed-carrots-683x1024.jpg)\n\n![candied pecans in a bowl. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/candied-pecans-1024x656.jpg)\n\n3.  Once the carrots were fork tender, they came out of the oven. I plated them and sprinkled them with goat cheese crumbles and the candied pecans I had just made.\n4.  For more color and flavor, I finished things off with fresh thyme leaves.\n\n![roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese served on a platter. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Glazed-Roasted-Carrots-with-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-684x1024.jpg)\n\nThat’s it! Perfection.\n\nMy Roasted Carrots with Candied Pecans and Goat Cheese were exactly what I had in my mind when I saw that plate of carrots at the dinner.

The sprinkle of thyme is the perfect finishing touch and a compliment to the season.\n\n![roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese side dish on a plate. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Roasted-Carrots-Candied-Pecans-Goat-Cheese-recipe-1024x644.jpg)\n\nRecipe Variations\n-----------------\n\nEnjoy this recipe and want to try a different variation? You’ve got it! Here are a few ideas to get your started.\n\n*   **Spicy Kick**: For those who like a bit of heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a drizzle of chili oil over the roasted carrots before serving.\n*   **Vegan Twist**: Swap the goat cheese for vegan feta or cashew-based cheese. For the candied pecans, use coconut oil instead of butter.\n*   **Nut Alternatives**: If pecans aren’t your thing or you’re just looking to mix things up, try candied walnuts or almonds instead.\n*   **Roasted Veggie Medley**: Introduce other root veggies to the party. Parsnips, beets, or sweet potatoes can be roasted alongside the carrots for a vibrant and varied dish.\n*   **Citrusy Fresh**: Add a zesty twist with a sprinkle of orange or lemon zest over the roasted carrots. The citrus notes can provide a refreshing contrast to the sweet and savory components.\n*   **Cheese Variations**: If goat cheese isn’t up your alley, try shaved Parmesan, crumbled feta, or even chunks of creamy brie. Each cheese brings its own unique flavor to the dish.\n\n![gold tongs taking a serving of roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Glazed-Carrots-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-recipe-756x1024.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Can I use baby carrots instead of regular carrots?\n\nTotally! Baby carrots are a great substitute. They might roast a tad quicker, so just keep an eye on them. That golden-brown caramelization is what we’re aiming for!\n\n### I’m out of maple syrup, any alternatives?\n\nNo sweat, friend! Honey works wonders as a substitute. You could also use agave nectar or even a touch of molasses for a deeper flavor.\n\n### Not a fan of goat cheese, what else can I use?\n\nThat’s the beauty of cooking – make it your own! Feta cheese or even blue cheese can offer a similar tangy kick. Or if you prefer something creamier, a sprinkle of fresh Parmesan or ricotta could be delish!\n\n### How long do these roasted carrots keep?\n\nThese babies taste best straight out of the oven. But if you do have leftovers, pop them in an airtight container and refrigerate. They’ll be good for 2-3 days. Just give them a little reheat before serving!\n\n### Can I prep the candied pecans ahead of time?\n\nAbsolutely! Make those pecans in advance and store them in an airtight container at room temperature. It’s a lifesaver, especially if you’re prepping for a big meal or gathering.\n\n### What other herbs can I use besides thyme?\n\n  \nRosemary is a great alternative with its aromatic and woody essence. Or even a sprinkle of parsley for some fresh vibes. Don’t be afraid to play around and find what tingles your taste buds!\n\nAs you have probably noticed, something sweet can be a nice complement to a savory meal. This is why people often serve something like candied yams or sweet butternut squash at Thanksgiving.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dish that’s a bit different, give these carrots a try. They are simple to make, and the flavor combination is on point.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\n![fork taking a bite of roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese.](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Roasted-Carrots-Candied-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-662x1024.jpg)\n\nMore Holiday Side You’ll Love\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Mashed Butternut Squash](https://inspiredbycharm.com/mashed-butternut-squash/)\n*   [Waldorf Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/waldorf-salad/)\n*   [Roasted Brussels Spouts Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/roasted-balsamic-brussels-sprouts/)\n*   [Cheesy Cauliflower Gratin](https://inspiredbycharm.com/cheesy-cauliflower-gratin/)\n*   [Broccolini Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/broccolini-salad/)\n\nI truly hope you give these roasted carrots a try – they’re a game-changer.

Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

Serve with apple slices and graham crackers! This is perfect as a holiday appetizer or the star of your cheeseboard!_\n\n![Maple Pecan Baked Brie - delicious melty brie topped with a maple, brown sugar, and pecan mixture. Serve with apple slices and graham crackers! Perfect holiday appetizer!](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/656/22096333500_cf9afdaf00_c.jpg)\n\nThis maple pecan baked brie is my alltime favorite appetizer for parties, especially holiday parties. It looks so pretty on a cheeseboard surrounded by sliced baguette, fruits, and other cheeses.\n\nAnd it’s also really easy to make. It’s as easy as putting a few toppings on top of the brie and baking until the cheese has melted!\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   **Brie cheese** – you want the round brie and leave the rind on so the cheese stays in while it bakes.\n*   **Maple syrup**\n*   **Brown sugar**\n*   **Cinnamon**\n*   **Pecans** – you can use walnuts if you prefer\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\n*   **Warm the brie.** Place brie on a small baking sheet. Bake at 350F for about 15 minutes or until softened. Remove and let cool for about 5 minutes.\n*   **Make topping.** While the brie cools, heat maple syrup, brown sugar, and cinnamon over low heat in a small saucepan. Stir until the sugar has dissolved; stir in pecans.\n*   **Assemble.** Pour over the brie and serve immediately.\n\n![Maple Pecan Baked Brie - delicious melty brie topped with a maple, brown sugar, and pecan mixture.

Perfect holiday appetizer!](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/765/22284903665_96d55d8756_c.jpg)\n\nWhere To Buy Brie\n-----------------\n\nYou can find brie at any large grocery store. It’s usually not with the shredded cheese but most stores will have a “fancy cheese” section near the deli and that’s where you can find it.\n\nIf you are having trouble finding it, check Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods – both should definitely have it.\n\nCan You Make It Ahead?\n----------------------\n\nBaked brie should not be made ahead. It’s best when served really hot so the brie is still gooey and dippable.\n\nWhat To Serve with Baked Brie\n-----------------------------\n\nMy favorite things to serve with baked brie is sliced baguette, graham crackers, and apple slices.\n\nYou could really do any sort of cookie, cracker, or fruit though. I think strawberries and crisp grapes would be delicious with this particular baked brie.\n\nI also think it goes great with a dry white wine if you are looking for drink options!\n\nHow To Reheat\n-------------\n\nYou can warm up leftover baked brie at a low temp (300F or so) in the oven or even in the microwave. You aren’t trying to cook it, just get it back to it’s melted, dippable state.\n\nCan You Freeze It?\n------------------\n\nI don’t recommend you try freezing this baked brie. Once it’s baked, it will probably be a mess to try to contain and freeze.\n\n![Maple Pecan Baked Brie - delicious melty brie topped with a maple, brown sugar, and pecan mixture.

We all know that around here, I like to keep Mondays fun, different, and delicious. Trust me when I say, this apple Panini fits the bill. I’m even going to go out and say that if you make this today, you’re going to have a pretty darn good (err delicious?) Monday.\n\nLet me explain, its real simple…\n\n_buttered sourdough bread_…I mean, that right there is close to perfection.\n\n_apple butter_…I used a homemade apple butter that I’ll be sharing with you all very soon, it _makes_ this Panini.\n\n_sharp cheddar cheese_…honeycrisp apple’s best friend.\n\n_buttery havarti cheese_…for its buttery flavor and major “melt” factor.\n\n_honeycrisp apples_…my very favorite apple variety.\n\ncrispy bacon…its salty, savory flavors are the perfect balance in this sweet Panini.\n\nhoney…to add just one more layer of deliciousness.\n\nfresh thyme…my current favorite herb and a favorite pairing with apples and cheddar.\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-2.jpg)\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-3.jpg)\n\nYou see? SO GOOD.\n\nI am pretty excited that the month of all things apples is finally here. To me, September is all about apples, I like to save the pumpkins for October and November. Every September I always have a million and one apple recipes I want to share with you guys, and this year is no different.\n\nI’m happy to be sharing this Panini as my very first apple recipe of the season. And while I have many more to come, this sandwich is near the top of my list of the most crave worthy, comforting, and cozy recipes.\n\nAs mentioned above, this Panini (or grilled cheese, it’s really whatever you’d like to call it) is pretty simple. You’re going to butter some bread, layer it with apple butter, cheese, fresh apples, bacon, honey, and a sprinkle of fresh thyme (lemon thyme is my favorite) and then press everything together in a Panini press ([this is my favorite](http://rstyle.me/n/cr7gdwb9wzf)). If you don’t have a Panini press, just make it on the stove top. No matter what, it’s going to be freaking-a-mazing.\n\nIt’s sweet, salty, and extra cheesy. Slice the apples thin so that they soften up while cooking and then as soon as the sandwich comes out of the Panini press, drizzle it with a touch more of honey and a sprinkle of fresh thyme. No debating this step, you just have to do it. It might not seem all that necessary, but I promise you, it’s what makes this sandwich so extra special…okay and it’s kind of a signature HBH step.\n\nDO IT.\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-4.jpg)\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-5.jpg)\n\nSpeaking of doing things, let’s go over some weekend stuff. We had some serious fall like weather int the late afternoons here, and the leaves have definitely started to turn. Autumn happens so fast up here in the mountains. The leaves are almost all off the trees by the second week of October. So you see, FAST.\n\nSince it’s was kind of chilly and cloudy later in the day on Sunday (summer mornings in the mountains are often sunny, then later in the day the clouds move in ), I decided to make a big pot of [chili](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/crockpot-beef-chili/). Along with my favorite beer bread from the [HBH cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553496395?tag=randohouseinc7986-20) (did you catch the video of this recipe on Instagram?!). While the chili slowly simmered on the stove, I did some serious online shopping damage.\n\nAhhhh. YIKES.\n\nI am not a good in store shopper, but give me a blanket and a computer and I can do some serious damage. I was shopping for both clothes and barn items for the upcoming [HBH retreat](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/half-baked-harvest-cookbook-colorado-retreat-giveaway/) here in Colorado at the end of the month. I am in need a few outfits and things for around my house. I found lots, and while I have some cute things on the way, I may have gone just a smidge overboard. What?! Like you’ve never done that before…\n\nAll I have to say is that online shopping is both amazing and scary. My finger tips love it, my credit card…not so much!\n\nAlso, I am still looking for few home items if you guys have suggestions of cute places to look. Let me know your favorite shops! I will be sharing everything I bought in this week’s Nine Favorite Things, so if interested, stay tuned!\n\nIn the meantime, I think we all know how our Monday needs to end.\n\nPick up some apples, cheese, and bread from the store, head home and make this Panini…\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-6.jpg)\n\nPrep Time 10 minutes\n\nCook Time 10 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings: 4 servings\n\nCalories Per Serving: 710 kcal\n\nNutritional information is only an estimate.

A must when we are entertaining. Put all other potato salads to shame with multiple layers of flavor and texture._ \n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4242/35487279212_82ab4ba8b4_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/35487279212/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4094/35268828850_383a95050c_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/35268828850/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\n**\\[This is an updated post from 2011.\\]**\n\nFor well over 6 years now this potato salad has been a staple of our summertime cookouts. Whenever we have people over, whether we are cooking up the most elaborate or the most simple of meals – this side dish stunner is my go-to.\n\nCooking up the potatoes first allows them to soften up a bit, so when they hit the grilled glistening with the Terra Delyssa olive oil, they get a golden brown char to the outside of them, while still holding their shape.\n\nTry substituting baby spinach, kale or other lettuces or greens for the arugula and even play with different vinaigrette moves, try adding in a whole grain mustard, a little lemon zest, maybe add some red pepper flakes.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4033/35268830450_4839d6d915_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/35268830450/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\nMy go-to herbs are chives and oregano but you can mix those up too, scallions instead of chives, rosemary or thyme instead of oregano. The pine nuts are a bonus crunch, but chopped walnuts or almond slices are great, too.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4238/34846902403_a59f974249_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/34846902403/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\nI promise after the first time you make a grilled potato salad, you will see all the possibilities and be hooked on it throughout the summer, as we are.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2771/5790346911_4da5eee204_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/5790346911 \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs by Tasty Yummies, on Flickr\")\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4238/34846902403_a59f974249_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/34846902403/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\n![](https://tasty-yummies.com/wp-content/uploads/35487278482_5d3502c49f_c-368x368.jpg)\n\n*   1 ½ to 2 pounds organic Yukon gold potatoes, red bliss potatoes also work\n*   1 bunch fresh arugula, regular, baby or wild\n*   4 tablespoons [Terra Delyssa Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil](http://www.terradelyssa.com/product/get/tplParam/3/language/en), divided\n*   2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar\\*\n*   2 cloves garlic, finely minced (1 small shallot thinly finely chopped is really nice instead of/or in addition to)\n*   ¼ cup finely chopped fresh chives\n*   ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh oregano\n*   1 ½ teaspoons sea salt\n*   ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to taste\n*   ¼ cup toasted pine nuts, optional\n\n*   Using a mandoline slicer, evenly slice the potatoes into 1/4\" slices, skin left on. If you do not have a mandoline slicer, you can cut them by hand, just be sure they are all similar thickness so they cook evenly.\n    \n*   Place the potato slices in a medium saucepan and cover with water, add a dash of salt. Bring them to a boil over a high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer potatoes until just fork tender, about 5-8 minutes once boiling.\n    \n*   Drain the potatoes and rinse in cold water to stop them from cooking.\n    \n*   Once cooled and drained, gently toss with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil (you need just enough to coat all the potatoes, but you don't want too much or it'll cause a flare up on the grill), and a dash each of salt and pepper, so they are all evenly coated.\n    \n*   Preheat the grill to medium-high. Add the potatoes to a nonstick grill pan, basket or wok, and place on the grill over the flames. Since the potatoes will not be in a single layer, you will want to toss them gently and often so some don't burn while others don't get browned. It will take approximately 20 minutes to cook all of the potatoes thoroughly and for them to be nicely browned. If any get caught in a hot spot and cook too quickly or begin to burn a bit, I just remove them early. If you don't want to mess with a grill basket or pan, you can cut the potatoes the long way and cook them directly on your grill in a single layer, this takes only about 5 minutes per side. (Our grill's grates are a bit too wide and we lose too many this way, so to avoid frustration we go with the pan).\n    \n*   While the potatoes are cooking, in a small bowl add the rice wine vinegar, the remaining Terra Delyssa olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, salt and pepper, mix well to combine.\n    \n*   Once the potatoes are cooked, place them in a large serving bowl, add the arugula and dressing, gently toss to combine everything. The arugula will begin to wilt a bit with the heat from the potatoes but will keep that nice crunch. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Serve.\n    \n\nchampagne, white wine or white balsamic vinegar also work here  \nrosemary, thyme or other fresh herbs are nice in this salad, too  \nLeave out garlic for low FODMAPs"

The crispy potatoes have a soft, creamy center piled with flavor._\n\n[![potato stacks](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-6.jpg)](https://www.littlebroken.com/creamy-potato-stacks-with-garlic-thyme-and-parmesan/)\n\n**What are Potato Stacks?**\n---------------------------\n\nThis potato dish is the star of any dinner table or holiday meal as it’s similar to **[scalloped potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/ina-garten-scalloped-potatoes/)**. The edges of the potatoes become crispy from the metal muffin cups while the center is perfectly tender. Parmesan cheese is an excellent pairing with potatoes, and this dish is no exception. You can substitute your favorite type of melty cheese if you prefer.\n\nIf your oven is full of other holiday dishes, you can cook these crispy herb potato stacks in the air fryer or counter oven instead. Even though this side dish is made with humble potato, the flavor combinations in this recipe will have you making this dish again and again.\n\nLooking for an easier potato side dish? Try our **[Cheesy Baked Mashed Potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/cheesy-mashed-potatoes/)** or **[Scalloped Potatoes with Cheese](https://www.littlebroken.com/cheesy-scalloped-potatoes/)**.\n\n![muffin tin potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-8.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients**\n---------------\n\nYou can find these simple ingredients in your local grocery store.\n\n*   **Heavy cream:** Heavy cream gives the potatoes a creamy flavor and bakes without separating.\n\n*   **Thyme leaves:** For best flavor, use fresh thyme. \n\n*   **Garlic:** Make sure the garlic is fresh and smells strongly of garlic for the best results.\n\n*   **Nutmeg:** This is a wonderfully warm fall spice. \n\n*   **Russet potatoes:** Russet potatoes are ideal for making these potato stacks but you can also use another starchy potato instead. Some great options include Yukon gold potatoes or white, yellow, or purple potatoes. Don’t use small fingerlings or petite potatoes since they won’t hold up as well.\n\n*   **[Kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2uFhEm0)**: Salt is important for potatoes to balance the starch. \n\n*   **Black pepper:** Freshly cracked black pepper adds flavor and a bit of spice.   \n\n*   **Parmesan cheese:** This hard, strong cheese pairs wonderfully with potatoes.   \n\n![ingredients for potato stacks recipe](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Ingredients.jpg)\n\n**What’s the Best Way to Slice the Potatoes?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe beauty of these crispy potato stacks are the thin slices of potatoes that create these little mounds.\n\n**Mandoline Slicer:** The best way to get your potatoes the perfect consistent slices is to use a **[mandoline slicer](https://amzn.to/3RWaTBh)**. This very sharp tool is used to make thinly sliced potatoes, other vegetables, fruit, cheese, or meat.\n\nYou do this by sliding the ingredient along the edge of the horizontal blade on the lowest setting. Be sure to use caution, as you can easily cut your fingers if you’re not careful.\n\n**Chef’s Knife:** If you don’t have a mandoline slicer, you can use a **[chef’s knife](https://amzn.to/3ByyQZX)** instead. The safest way to do this is to cut a slice off the bottom of the potato to get it to sit flat on the surface. Keeping your fingers out of the way, make cuts as thin as possible with a sharp knife.\n\n![sliced potatoes in a bowl](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Step.jpg)\n\n**How to Make Potato Stacks**\n-----------------------------\n\nHere are some brief instructions on how to make these cheesy stacks. You can find the full recipe below.\n\n1.  Prepare a standard muffin tray with nonstick cooking spray.\n2.  Warm together cream, thyme, garlic, and nutmeg in a small saucepan.\n3.  Toss the potato slices with salt and pepper and layer them into stacks in the prepared muffin pan.\n4.  Spoon the cream over each potato stack and then sprinkle with parmesan cheese.\n5.  Bake until the potatoes are knife tender and golden brown on top.\n6.  Remove the muffin pan from the oven and let sit. Run a knife around the edges to loosen up the stacks and carefully remove them to a serving platter.\n\n![potatoes with cream in muffin pan](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Step2.jpg)\n\n**Recipe Tips**\n---------------\n\nHere are a few tips and tricks to ensure you get the best crispy parmesan potato stacks every single time.\n\n*   **Garnish!** Top each potato stack with a sprig of fresh herbs for a beautiful presentation. \n*   **Get the right size potatoes.** Make sure you buy medium to small-size potatoes so they fit in a standard muffin pan.\n*   **No need to peel potatoes.** In a hurry? Feel free to leave the skin on the potatoes before slicing them. Just clean the outside and scrub away any dirt.\n*   **Heavy cream is the key.** Do not replace heavy cream with half and half or milk. It will not thicken during baking and you’ll end up with oily potatoes.\n\n**Variations**\n--------------\n\nYou can easily make this tasty side dish with your favorite ingredients. Here are some options you can try:\n\n*   Use other fresh herbs like rosemary or oregano. If you don’t have fresh herbs, you can use dried herbs instead.\n*   Melty cheese like gruyere cheese, Havarti, mozzarella cheese, comte, cheddar, asiago, or romano.  \n*   Use your favorite seasonings depending on what you’re serving the potatoes with. Try using ginger, cardamom, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, or cayenne pepper. \n\n![stacked potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-7.jpg)\n\n**Other Ways to Cook This Dish**\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you aren’t able to use your oven because it’s been taken over by the **[Thanksgiving turkey](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-turkey-breast/)**, you can also cook these potato stacks in an **[air fryer](https://amzn.to/3RHQTCW)** or countertop oven.\n\nSimply prepare the potatoes as you normally would in the muffin tin and then pop it in the air fryer at 350 degrees and cook until the potatoes are soft all the way through.\n\nGarnish potato stacks with more parmesan cheese after they come out of the oven for added richness and flavor!\n\n![recipe for potato stacks](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-11.jpg)\n\n**Storing Tips**\n----------------\n\n**Refrigerate:** Store these potato stacks in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. \n\n**Reheat:** You can reheat them in 30-second increments in the microwave until they’re heated through.\n\n**Freeze:** To freeze them, make the stacks in the oven, allow them to cool completely, place them in a single layer in a container, and store in the freezer for up to three months. Potatoes might not have the same texture and taste when thawed.\n\n**FAQs**\n--------\n\n****Do I need to use heavy cream to make potato stacks?****\n\nYou can make these potato stacks dairy-free with olive oil or bacon fat instead. They will not be as creamy but will have deliciously crispy edges.\n\n****What else can I top potato stacks with?****\n\nBesides topping them with fresh herbs, you can top them with cooked bacon.\n\n****How can I tell when the potatoes are done cooking?****\n\nYour fork or sharp knife should slide right through the stack with no resistance when they’re done baking.\n\n**Video: How to Make Potato Stacks**\n------------------------------------\n\n**More Holiday Side Dishes**\n----------------------------\n\n*   **[Hasselback Potato Gratin](https://www.littlebroken.com/hasselback-potato-gratin/)**\n*   **[Lemon Asparagus Risotto](https://www.littlebroken.com/asparagus-and-lemon-risotto-7-tips-on-how-to-make-the-perfect-risotto/)**\n*   **[Red Skin Mashed Potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/red-skin-mashed-potatoes-recipe/)**\n*   **[Roasted Asparagus with Lemon](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-asparagus-with-lemon/)**\n\n[Print](https://www.littlebroken.com/creamy-potato-stacks-with-garlic-thyme-and-parmesan/print/10492/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\n_Creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside, these creamy potato stacks are simple to make, delicious to eat, and really can’t be beat. It’s my new favorite way to serve potatoes for the holidays!_\n\n* * *\n\n*   1 1/2 cups heavy cream\n*   1 sprig fresh thyme\n*   2 garlic cloves, _minced_\n*   1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg\n*   2 lbs. medium russet potatoes (about 4-5), _peeled and sliced 1/8 to 1/16 inch thick_\n*   1 tsp. [kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2uFhEm0)\n*   1/2 tsp. black pepper\n*   Freshly grated parmesan cheese\n\n#### Special Tools\n\n*   **[12 cup standard muffin pan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003W0UMPI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003W0UMPI&linkCode=as2&tag=littbrok-20&linkId=6X4VZ2N25Q4H3SDR)**\n*   **[Mandoline slicer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001THGPDO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001THGPDO&linkCode=as2&tag=littbrok-20&linkId=IZC2357SOUAOKVX7)**\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n* * *\n\n1.  Preheat the oven to 375F. Spray 12 cup standard muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.\n2.  In a small sauce pan, whisk together cream, thyme, garlic, and nutmeg. Bring to a slow simmer and remove from the heat. You want the cream just heated through. Discard the thyme.\n3.  Toss the potato slices with salt and pepper and layer them into stacks in the prepared muffin cups, filling each one to the top but not over the top.\n4.  Spoon cream over each potato stack, filling almost to the top. You will have a couple or so slices exposed. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.\n5.  Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the potatoes are knife tender and golden brown on top.\n6.  Remove the muffin pan from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edges to loosen up the stacks and carefully remove them to a serving platter. Serve immediately.\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Potatoes:** Other starchy potatoes can be used instead, such as Yukon gold potatoes or white, yellow, or purple potatoes.\n*   **Cream:** For best results, do not replace heavy cream with half and half or another milk alternative. In my experience, half and half will separate during baking, and potatoes turn out oily. \n*   **Leftovers:** Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\n\n### Nutrition\n\n*   **Serving Size:** 1 potato stack\n*   **Calories:** 164\n*   **Sugar:** 1.8 g\n*   **Sodium:** 251.7 mg\n*   **Fat:** 11.5 g\n*   **Carbohydrates:** 13.1 g\n*   **Protein:** 3 g\n*   **Cholesterol:** 35.2 mg\n\n_Recipe originally published November 2015_\n\nYou May Also Like…\n------------------"

It takes 15 minutes to make and everyone loves it!_ \n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-1.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! \")_This post is sponsored by Kroger._ \n\nThe holidays are right around the corner and today I am sharing my “go to” appetizer. This easy **Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini** is SO easy and party goers always ooh and ahh over it. I always love watching my friends and family take a bite for the first time. It is one of those recipes where people close their eyes and say: wow, yum, mmmm, so good, amazing, and some even make weird noises, which is kind of awkward at a party, but this crostini is THAT good! And they love it even more when they find out how easy it is to make!\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-2.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! Your guests will LOVE it! \")\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to Cincinnati for a blogging event with [Kroger](https://www.kroger.com/). We have been working with Kroger this year so it was fun to see the headquarters, meet with the Kroger team, and spend time with the other Kroger bloggers.\n\nKroger asked every blogger to prepare a recipe for a holiday meal. We all shopped, cooked, and ate together and it was so much fun. We used the new [ClickList](https://www.kroger.com/onlineshopping/signin?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kroger.com%2Fstorecatalog%2Fservlet%2FOnlineShoppingStoreSetup) program to do our grocery shopping. We ordered our groceries online and then picked them up at the Kroger store.\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-7.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! It only takes 15 minutes to make! \")\n\nFor the holiday meal, I made my favorite Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini. I knew it would be a hit with the group!\n\nSo let’s talk about how easy this recipe is. I told you easy and I mean EASY. The appetizer starts with a baguette, but I don’t even have to slice it because I always buy the perfectly sliced baguette at Kroger (Smith’s in Utah). Next, I spread apple butter on the bread slices. I don’t make the apple butter, I totally cheat and use Private Selection Apple Butter. It is perfectly spiced and tastes amazing.\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-5.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! \")\n\nOn top of the apple butter, I place slices of creamy [Murray’s Cheese Brie](http://www.murrayscheese.com/). I place the crostini in the oven until the brie gets all melty and gooey. Remove from the oven and top with candied pecans and a drizzle of honey. At home, I use my homemade [candied pecans](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/candied-pecans/) because I always have them on hand, but at the event I used Private Selections candied pecans and they are really tasty! Kroger really does have everything!\n\nAt the event, I also tried Private Selection’s Vanilla and Nutmeg Infused Honey and oh my goodness! It was the perfect ending to my crostini. If you can’t find it, any honey will do, but that honey is amazing!\n\nThe Brie, Apple, and Honey was the perfect start to our holiday feast! Everyone loved it. And let me tell you, when a group of bloggers makes a holiday meal, you leave very full and very happy. I was amazed by all of the creative and delicious dishes. I wish we could make dinner together every night!\n\nThis easy Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini is the perfect holiday appetizer. It takes about 15 minutes to make and your guests will be raving about it until the next holiday season.

I may earn a small commission for my endorsement, recommendation, testimonial, and/or link to any products or services from this website.\n\n_These Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls are a healthy and hearty way to enjoy your morning meal! They’re also Vegan, Gluten Free, Sugar Free and Grain Free._\n\n**Edit:** the photos for this recipe were updated on 10/2019.\n\nWhat do you eat when it’s too cold for a smoothie, pancakes sound too complicated, and you’ve had oats for breakfast for way too many days in a row?\n\nFluffy Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls, of course!\n\n![ingredients for sweet potato breakfast bowl on round white cutting board](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl.jpg)\n\nThese sweet little spuds have made their way onto our [lunch](https://frommybowl.com/sweet-potato-boats-tahini-dressing/) and [dinner](https://frommybowl.com/sweet-potato-peanut-stew/) plates, so why is it that we don’t enjoy them for breakfast as well? To be honest, I’m not quite sure. Which is why I’m here to change that 😉\n\nThese Sweet Potato Bowls are _kind_ of like a smoothie bowl…but warm! Think **fluffy, caramel-y whipped sweet potatoes** infused with cinnamon and some healthy plant based fats, then sprinkled with some glorious toppings like pomegranate and pumpkin seeds. Are you drooling yet?\n\n![hand pouring milk into large bowl of sweet potato piececs](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-2-200x300.jpg)![hand mixer whipping sweet potato breakfast bowls in large glass bowl](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-3-200x300.jpg)\n\nObviously you can top your bowls with whatever you would like, but I was trying to stick with the winter theme here. And I must say, the combination of pomegranate, pumpkin seeds, cacao nibs, coconut yogurt, and some **[Easy Vegan Granola](https://frommybowl.com/easy-vegan-granola-recipe/)** is very, _very_ refreshing.\n\n![sweet potato breakfast bowls next to smaller bowls of topping ideas](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-4.jpg)\n\nI would be remiss if I forgot to mention that these Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls kinda taste like a healthy **[Sweet Potato Casserole](https://frommybowl.com/healthy-sweet-potato-casserole/)**. And who the _heck_ wouldn’t want to eat that for breakfast?! Because we are roasting our Sweet Potatoes before we whip them into their fluffy final product, they’re already naturally sweet. I personally thought they were great on their own, and didn’t feel the need to add any extra sugar to them. So not only are they vegan, but they are also gluten free, grain free, and sugar free as well!\n\nTo be honest, I don’t know if there are any more “free” labels out there that you’d even want to hit. So I’m going to stop my rambling, and get onto the good stuff (literally).\n\n![two sweet potato breakfast bowls topped with coconut yogurt, pomegranate seeds, and granola](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-8.jpg)\n\n### **A Few Final Thoughts:**\n\n*   There are many ways to cook a sweet potato, but I would **strongly recommend** that you roast them for this recipe. Steaming and microwaving your spuds does **not** make them as soft, sweet, or caramelized as the oven. You are ultimately your own boss in life, but you have officially been warned! (_Please just roast them. You’ll thank me later_.)\n*   These bowls can be enjoyed both warm and chilled, but I must say that I prefer them warm. If you heat them up in the microwave, the sweet potatoes won’t lose their moisture!\n*   Short on sweet potatoes? You can easily sub them for pumpkin or butternut squash puree instead! Just keep in mind that squash will be less sweet, so you may need to add in 1 to 2 tablespoons of sweetener. I would recommend maple syrup or coconut sugar.\n\nIf you’re looking for more vegan breakfast recipes, you’ll also love these **[Pumpkin Spice Latte Overnight Oats](https://frommybowl.com/pumpkin-spice-latte-overnight-oats/)** or these **[Salted Caramel Apple Breakfast Bars](https://frommybowl.com/salted-caramel-apple-breakfast-bars/)**!\n\nFinally, if you make this recipe and decide to share it on [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/frommybowl/) or [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/frommybowl/)**,** don’t forget to tag me [**@FromMyBowl**](https://www.instagram.com/frommybowl/) + #FromMyBowl!

Preheat your oven to 400F and line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Wash the sweet potatoes, but do not peel them. Piece the potatoes a few times with a knife, then place on the tray and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a “caramel” starts to ooze out of the pierced holes. (Note: If you have large sweet potatoes, I would recommend cutting them in half lengthwise and placing them cut side down on the baking tray to reduce cooking time).\n2.  Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven, and carefully scoop our their flesh into a large bowl. Add in the milk, flax, nut butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Use a hand mixer to “cream” the mixture together on for 60 to 90 seconds, starting with the lowest setting. Alternatively, you can place all ingredients into a food processor and blend until thick and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.\n3.  Divide into serving bowls, top as desired, and serve warm. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Substitutions****:** ground flax can be replaced with ground chia seeds, or omitted.\n*   **Time Hacks:**  roasted sweet potatoes are the _most_ sweet and tender, but you can also microwave them for a few minutes in a time crunch. If you already have sweet potato puree and would like to use it in this recipe, use 1 1/3 cups for this recipe (~330 g)\n\nHey there, I’m Caitlin!

Right: Clean acorn squash.](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sausage-Stuffed-Acorn-Squash-2.png)\n\n**Roast the acorn squash:**\n\n*   Coat the acorn squash with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\n*   Place on a baking sheet, skin side down, and bake for 50-60 minutes until they’re fork tender. The roasting time will vary depending on the size of your acorn squash.\n\n![Left: Seasoned acorn squash on a baking sheet. Right: Roasted acorn squash. ](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sausage-Stuffed-Acorn-Squash-1.png)\n\n**Cook the sausage and aromatics:**\n\n*   While the squash cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.\n*   Add the sausage and cook for 5-6 minutes until brown. As it cooks, use a wooden spoon to break apart any large pieces. \n*   Remove the sausage from the pan and set it aside, leaving the fat in the skillet.\n*   Add the onions and bell pepper to the same skillet and cook for 3-5 minutes until they’re soft. Then, add garlic and cook for 30 seconds.\n\n![Left: Sausage cooking in a skillet.

A serving size is one-half of an acorn squash per person.\n*   When you’re roasting acorn squash, look for a little caramelization around the edges. This is an easy way to add extra flavor.\n*   In this sausage and apple stuffed acorn squash recipe, I use nitrate-free sausage, which is better for you.\n\n*   **To Store**: Once your leftover acorn squash has cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n*   **To Reheat**: Reheat in a microwave or in the oven at 350°F until heated through.\n\n*   **Tender chicken or pork**: This dish is a full meal on its own, but it also pairs wonderfully with my [grilled chicken thighs](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/grilled-chicken-thighs/) or easy [oven pork chops](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/easy-oven-pork-chop-recipe/).\n*   **A seasonal salad**: A fresh, fall-inspired salad, like my [shaved Brussels sprouts salad](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprouts-salad/) is the perfect side dish to serve with sausage stuffed acorn squash.\n*   **Roasted vegetables**: Savory roasted vegetables, such as [roasted cauliflower](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/spicy-roasted-cauliflower-recipe/) or [cabbage steaks](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/cabbage-steak-recipe/) provide a nice balance to the sweetness in this recipe.\n\n*   **Add grains:** To make this dish even more satisfying, add a whole grain to the filling, such as [wild rice](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-wild-rice-recipe/) or [quinoa](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/how-to-make-fluffy-quinoa/).\n*   **Top with cheese:** A salty, melty cheese would be so yummy on top. Try a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese or crumbled goat cheese.\n*   **Switch up the squash:** Enjoy all the winter squash while it’s in season and make a variation of this recipe with your favorite squash variety such as delicata squash. See my [stuffed butternut squash with Italian sausage](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/italian-sausage-stuffed-butternut-squash/) recipe for inspiration!\n*   **Nut:** top this recipe with your favorite nut such as [pecans](https://amzn.to/47GYtFJ), [almonds](https://amzn.to/47D4GCH) or [walnut](https://amzn.to/416CC87).\n\n*   [Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3Ro9Hta): The squash is roasted on a standard 9×13 baking sheet.\n*   [Skillet](https://amzn.to/3R4pZFX): A large skillet is needed to cook the filling.\n*   [Knife](https://amzn.to/47Zsj8j): This recipe requires some chopping, so you’ll need a nice sharp knife.\n\n****How do I prepare acorn squash?****\n\nFirst, you’ll want to start with a good acorn squash. Look for one that is dark green in color, heavy for its size, and has no blemishes. Then, using a sharp knife, you’ll cut the squash in half between one of the ridges. Because of its shape, acorn squash is easier to cut if you place it on a towel to hold it steady. Next, you’ll remove the stem and scoop out the pulp and seeds. Now, your squash is ready to roast and fill with your favorite ingredients!\n\n****Can I eat the skin of an acorn squash?****\n\nYes, you can! After roasting acorn squash, the skin becomes soft and tender enough to cut with a fork. However, if you’d rather not eat the skin, you can easily separate it from everything else and just enjoy the inside of the acorn squash.\n\n****Could I use another vegetable instead of acorn squash?****\n\nYou can create endless variations of this recipe using different vegetables. You’ll want to choose vegetables that are sturdy enough to hold the stuffing when they’re cooked, like bell peppers, eggplant, or potatoes. Other varieties of squash like butternut squash or zucchini also work great.\n\nMore Delicious Squash Recipes\n-----------------------------\n\nWant more seasonal recipes?

Try my [Sweet Potato Gnocchi](https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-potato-gnocchi/).\n*   **Italian Turkey Sausage**. For a boost of protein and even more comforting flavor, this recipe also includes Italian sausage. I use chicken or turkey sausage 99% of the time. It’s leaner than pork sausage but still delivers on flavor. Pinky promise, you won’t notice the swap.\n\nTip!\n----\n\n*   **Butternut Squash**. Sweet, flavorful, and nutritious. Butternut squash is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\n*   **Spinach**. For an extra boost of nutrition. Spinach is rich in fiber and vitamins.\n*   **Butter**.

For quintessential fall flavor.\n*   **Nutmeg**. Adds an irressitable warmth and coziness to the dish. Plus, it tastes fantastic with the butternut squash!\n*   **Parmesan**. The perfect finishing touch!\n\n### The Directions\n\n1.  Brown the sausage and remove to a plate.\n2.  Sauté the squash and onion with the garlic, sage, and spices.\n3.  Add the chicken broth and gnocchi. Stir in the sausage and spinach. Top with Parmesan. DIG IN!\n\nDietary Note\n------------\n\n*   **To Make Vegan**. If you need this to be a vegan butternut squash gnocchi recipe, you can swap the butter for vegan butter, vegetable broth for the chicken broth, omit the Italian sausage, and use a vegan Parmesan substitute.\n*   **To Make Gluten Free**. For gluten-free butternut squash gnocchi, select a gluten-free gnocchi option. Note that you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\n![Potato pasta, ground meat, and veggies in a pot](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sausage-Butternut-Squash-Gnocchi-1.jpg)\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   **To Store**.

It’s typically eaten like pasta with a sauce.\n\nFor this recipe, I recommend using premade, shelf-stable gnocchi, which you can find near the pasta in your grocery store.\n\n**Can I Use a Different Type of Italian Sausage?**\n\nI prefer to use Italian turkey or chicken sausage because they have less fat. However, you can certainly use Italian pork sausage if you prefer.\n\n**Can I Use Pre-Cut Butternut Squash Cubes?**\n\nYes, you can cut a butternut squash yourself or use pre-cut butternut squash cubes. Depending upon the size they are cut, you may need to adjust the saute time accordingly.\n\nemail me the recipe!\n--------------------\n\nEnter your email below to save this recipe to your free Well Plated recipe box.\n\nFrom time to time, we’ll send you the best of Well Plated.

Lightly grease the foil-lined baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.\n    \n*   Make sure Brussels sprouts have trimmed ends and yellow leaves are removed. Then, slice all Brussels sprouts in half. In a medium bowl, combine halved Brussels sprouts, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt (to taste), and toss to combine. Place onto a foil-lined baking sheet, cut side down, and roast in the oven at 400 F for about 20-25 minutes. During the last 5-10 minutes of roasting, turn them over for even browning, the cut sides should be nicely and partially charred but not blackened (see my photos).\n    \n\n#### Roasted butternut squash:\n\n*   Preheat oven to 400 F. Lightly grease the foil-lined baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.\n    \n*   In a medium bowl, combine cubed butternut squash (peeled and seeded),1 tablespoon of olive oil, maple syrup, and cinnamon, and toss to mix.\n    \n*   Place butternut squash in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning once half-way through baking, until softened.\n    \n*   **Note:**  You can roast both Brussels sprouts and butternut squash on 2 separate baking sheets at the same time, on the same rack in the oven – that’s what I did.\n    \n\n#### Assembly:\n\n*   In a large bowl, combine roasted Brussels sprouts, roasted butternut squash, pumpkin seeds, and cranberries, and mix to combine. (OPTIONAL): For more sweetness, add 2 or 4 tablespoons of maple syrup, if desired – do not add all maple syrup at once, start with 2 tablespoons, then add more, if desired, and toss with the salad ingredients to combine.\n    \n*   **Tip:** You can add a small amount of apricot jelly or jam (1 or 2 tablespoons) to the maple syrup (stir it together) prior to mixing the maple syrup with the veggies. This will thicken up the maple syrup and get it to stick to the veggies! \n    \n\n#### Looking for more Thanksgiving side dishes?\n\n*   I have created a comprehensive recipe collection of [60 Thanksgiving side dishes](https://juliasalbum.com/thanksgiving-side-dishes/) conveniently **categorized by ingredient**: Green Beans, Butternut Squash, Sweet Potatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Potatoes, Acorn Squash, Spaghetti Squash, Asparagus, Broccoli, etc. It's a great resource to browse through for a last moment holiday inspiration!

A satisfying, veggie-filled and tasty breakfast.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-7-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### You may be wondering, what is a hash anyway?\n\nA hash is a dish of diced, ground or chopped meat and often times vegetables sautéed in a frying pan. We think it’s the perfect way to start the day when you’re in search of something savory, warm, satisfying, and hearty. Thanks to the well-balanced nature of this dish, it will keep your blood sugars stable all morning long, leaving you satisfied and ready to tackle the day.\n\nMaking a hash is also the perfect opportunity to ‘clean out the fridge’ and use up what you have on hand. But if you’re looking for more guidance we have some additional hash recipes for you to try including [Sweet Potato Hash with Bacon](https://therealfooddietitians.com/sweet-potato-hash-recipe/), [Tex Mex Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/tex-mex-sweet-potato-hash/), [Chicken Apple Sausage Sweet Potato Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/chicken-apple-sausage-sweet-potato-hash/), and [Brussels Sprouts Sweet Potato Sausage Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/brussels-sprouts-sweet-potato-sausage-hash/).\n\n#### Serve as an egg-free breakfast or if you wish, top with a fried egg.\n\nImagine your breakfast plate filled with tender butternut squash cubes, sweet apples and savory homemade sausage. While this Butternut Squash and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a satisfyingly scrumptious egg-free breakfast, a fried egg or two makes a nice addition for extra protein and staying power. Whatever you choose, we know you’re going to love this recipe! \n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-5-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Meal prep-friendly.\n\n[**Butternut Squash**](https://therealfooddietitians.com/butternut-squash-noodles-with-sausage-and-kale/) and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a great recipe for your weekend meal prep. It’s quick to make and reheats ever so nicely. Preparing this dish ahead of time, either from start to finish or simply pre-chopping your vegetables and cooking the sausage means you’ll spend less time in the kitchen during the busy work week.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-6-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Making your own sausage comes with benefits.\n\nUsing ground turkey (or chicken or pork) and a few dried spices from the pantry in place of store-bought breakfast sausage saves you money and means you’ll be getting less sodium and no preservatives. You know exactly what goes into the sausage when you make your own. The sausage is freezer-friendly so if you wish, you could double or triple the sausage portion of the recipe so that you can stock your freezer with some for future meals and recipes.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-8-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Not a kale lover? No problem.\n\nReplace the kale with spinach or chard or leave it out. It’s still incredibly delicious.\n\nGive this Butternut Squash and Apple Hash with Sausage a try! It makes for a much better option as compared to those high-sugar breakfasts we might be familiar with. Better yet, add it to this weekends meal prep so that you’ll have a healthy breakfast, lunch or dinner ready for reheating and eating. \n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1½ Tbsp.

Made with crisp apple slices, crunchy & sweet pomegranate seeds, and lots of greens paired with a homemade balsamic dressing. It’s the perfect salad to serve as a Thanksgiving side salad or to compliment your favorite fall meal!_ \n\n![A wooden bowl with apple pomegranate salad and a bed of greens in it. The bowl of salad is sitting on a wooden cutting board with a dark background behind it. With pomegranate seeds and a napkin arranged around the salad.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pomegranate-salad-2.jpg)\n\nIf you’ve never sprinkled sweet pomegranate seeds over a salad, then you are in for a treat! This is one of my favorite salads to make for fall and winter, and it’s always a crowd-pleaser.\n\nThis dish has a little bit of everything in it – lots of texture, sweet fruit taste, and leafy greens. You will fall in love with the flavors and find that it compliments almost any meal!\n\nIngredients You’ll Need\n-----------------------\n\nBelow you’ll find the full list of ingredients needed to make this salad happen!\n\n![Ingredients for apple pomegranate salad arranged on a brown wooden cutting board.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pomegranate-salad-ingredients.jpg)\n\n*   **Greens:** For the base of the salad I love using mixed greens, arugula, or kale! \n*   **Apples:** my favorite apples for salad are honey crisp, pink lady, or fuji!\n*   **Pomegranate seeds:** these sweet seeds add the perfect pop of flavor to the salad. \n*   **Nuts:** for the crunchy texture you can use chopped walnuts, pecans, almonds, or hazelnuts. \n*   **Oil:** for the salad dressing! I recommend using quality olive oil. \n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** a quality balsamic vinegar to flavor the salad dressing. \n*   **Honey:** to sweeten the salad dressing! You can also use maple syrup or coconut sugar. \n*   **Garlic powder:** this will add flavor to the salad dressing!\n*   **Cheese:** to add an extra level of flavor you can sprinkle feta or gorgonzola cheese over top!\n\n![A hand using a spoon to stir balsamic vinegar dressing in a liquid measuring cup.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/butternut-squash-salad-4.jpg)\n\nExtra Tips for Success\n----------------------\n\n*   **Make dairy-free:** This salad is delicious with feta or gorgonzola, but if you need it to be dairy-free you can leave the cheese out altogether. It’s just as delicious!\n*   **Make this salad ahead:** If this salad needs to be prepped ahead of time I recommend storing all the prepped ingredients in separate ziplock bags, then assembling the salad as needed close to the time of serving. \n*   **Add protein:** you can pair this salad with grilled chicken as a protein or for a plant-based option, try lentils or chickpeas.\n*   **More toppings to add:** some extra toppings you can add would be dried cranberries or cherries, roasted butternut squash, cooked wild rice for heartiness, or sliced pears!\n*   **A tip if using kale:** I usually blend the base of this salad with kale and arugula. But if you dislike the texture of kale my best tip would be to chop it really small. It blends right in with the arugula, and no one ever notices!\n\n![A close up of apple pomegranate salad in a bed of greens in a wooden bowl. ](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/apple-pomegranate-salad.jpg)\n\nWhat to Pair it With\n--------------------\n\nThis salad goes perfectly with just about any meal!

Either way, feel free to make the kick work for your tastebuds!\n\n### Tips For Choosing A Ripe Mango\n\nThe best way to [choose a ripe mango](https://www.mango.org/choose-a-mango/#:~:text=Squeeze%20the%20mango%20gently.,at%20all%20levels%20of%20ripeness%3F) is to lightly squeeze it. If it’s just a bit soft, then it’s ripe and ready to eat. If it’s firm, then it isn’t quite ready!\n\n### Slicing The Mango\n\nThe best way to slice a mango is to cut it into 4 sections, starting at the top/center of the mango, right next to the seed, and guiding your knife down the side of the seed. Once you have 4 sections, cut each mango into cubes or slices, making sure not to pierce through the skin. Use your thumb or finger to separate the skin from the flesh of the mango.\n\n### How To Cook Quinoa To Perfection\n\nIt’s all about the water-to-quinoa ratio and how you cook it. Perfectly fluffy quinoa can be achieved single every time with [these simple steps for cooking quinoa!](https://www.jaroflemons.com/how-to-cook-quinoa-perfectly-every-time/)\n\nMeal Prep This Mango Quinoa Salad\n---------------------------------\n\nTo meal prep this salad, prepare the quinoa and chop the veggies (except for the avocado).

Olive Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).  I generally use Olive Oil for roasting and EVOO for dressings.  EVOO has a lower smoke point and I find it generally has a nicer and lighter taste, which is why I save it for dressings.\n\n**Nuts:**  I almost always have almonds in my cupboard, and find they are the perfect versatile crunch in salads.  Having said that, so many nuts would work well in this recipe.  If you don't have almonds on hand (or just don't like them), try pine nuts, walnuts or pecans instead.\n\n**Dressing:**  I've made a simple honey lemon vinaigrette for the dressing.  If honey isn't your thing, you can substitute for maple syrup or brown rice / rice malt syrup OR simply omit altogether if you don't want a sweetener.\n\n![chopped sweet potato and onion on a baking tray](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad2.jpg)\n\n💭 CAN I MAKE THIS SALAD AHEAD?\n-------------------------------\n\nRoasted vegetable salads do take a little longer to prepare than those made with more traditional salad ingredients, but there are a few ways to plan ahead to cut down prep time on the day and make this an easy work lunch.\n\nYou can roast a few sweet potatoes at the start of the week and use these to make up the salad each day as you go.  This is a great option if you want to have this salad as a quick weeknight dinner.  It'll be on the table in 5 minutes.  Roasted sweet potato will last in the fridge in an airtight container for 5 days.\n\nOR you can prep the salad minus the dressing, nuts and avocado and portion out for a day or two.  Then when the time comes simply add in some chopped avocado and dressing.  I don't recommend prepping salads too far in advance, as I find the ingredients don't tend to hold up that well.  But prepping this for a work lunch the night before is absolutely fine.\n\n![sweet potato, avocado and feta salad in a white bowl](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad4.jpg)\n\n🥗 MORE SCRUMPTIOUS SALAD RECIPES:\n----------------------------------\n\n*   [Roast Pumpkin, Spinach and Feta Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/pumpkin-feta-salad/)\n*   [Middle Eastern Bean Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/bean-salad/)\n*   [Cabbage and Crunchy Noodle Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/cabbage-and-crunchy-noodle-salad/)\n*   [Crunchy Kale Salad with Lemon Tamari Dressing](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/crunchy-kale-salad-lemon-tamari-dressing/)\n*   [Roast Pumpkin and Chickpea Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/roast-pumpkin-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [35 Easy and Yummy Salad Recipes](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/yummy-salad-recipes/)\n*   OR see all [Salad Recipes](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/category/recipes/salads/)\n\nIf you’ve tried this **Roasted Sweet Potato, Avocado and Feta Salad** I’d love to hear how you enjoyed it!

Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

Potato ‘french’ fries are a staple pretty much everywhere, and with good reason, with that crispy outside and silky smooth inside, they are simply irresistible! Sweet potato fries are becoming more popular these days and carrot fries are just as good! Carrots are pretty easy to turn into fries, you just need to get some large ones, peel them and slice them into sticks before frying them! Of course you can deep fry them, and they are amazing deep fried, but you can also roast them, which keeps them a little lighter. When I roast carrot fries I like to season them with salt and pepper and hit of parmesan cheese adds a huge amount of flavour! In addition to just tasting amazing, the parmesan also melts onto the carrot fries and caramelizes getting all nice and crispy and good making the fries even crispier! Carrots are sweet so I like to serve them with a spicy dipping sauce like chipotle mayo or a gochujang ketchup and they are the perfect side for pretty much any meal, especially an Easter dinner!\n\n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004604-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004614-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004566-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004592-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004603-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")\n\n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004575-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")\n\n#### Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\n\n**Prep Time**: 10 minutes **Cook Time**: 20 minutes **Total Time**: 30 minutes **Servings**: 6\n\nSweet roasted carrot fries covered with crispy parmesan cheese!\n\n##### ingredients\n\n*   2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4 in thick ‘fries’\n*   1 tablespoon oil\n*   salt and pepper to taste\n*   1/2 cup parmigiano reggiano (parmesan cheese), grated\n\n##### directions\n\n1.

Chop up your vegetables.\n2.  Open a package of already prepared gnocchi.\n3.  Toss everything on a pan, drizzle some olive oil and balsamic vinegar on top.\n4.  Bake!\n\nWhat is gnocchi? If you've never had gnocchi you are in for a treat! Gnocchi is a potato dumpling where potatoes are mashed then mixed with some flour and egg. You can make them from scratch, or there are really good store bought options located in the pasta aisle. [DeLallo's gnocchi](https://amzn.to/3nzblHR) is the brand I use frequently. There are whole wheat and sweet potato gnocchi options too (which would totally work for this recipe!).\n\n![](https://thehungrywaitress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-Easy-Gnocchi-1000x1500-2-683x1024.jpg)\n\n### **What vegetable goes well with gnocchi?**\n\nFor this recipe I use zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, eggplant and tomatoes but you can use up whatever you have in the fridge. The tomatoes are key however in making the sauce so don't skip those! You can switch out the vegetables, add white beans or ready made pesto for a little extra sauce.\n\nIf you have a meat eater in the house, you can roast some chicken on a separate pan and serve it on the side (or one reader recommended smoked sausage!).\n\nCan you meal prep this recipe? Totally! This recipe reheats well in the microwave if you want to take it for lunch. You might make a double portion for dinner if you want any leftovers though!\n\n![](https://thehungrywaitress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-Easy-Gnocchi-1000x1500-1-683x1024.jpg)\n\n**Can you bake gnocchi instead of boiling?**\n\nYes! For store bought gnocchi there is no need to boil the gnocchi before baking. Just plop them on the baking sheet directly from the package. I do not know the homemade gnocchi would have the same results.\n\nIf you love this recipe I would love to know!

Chicken tenderloins, baby carrots and gold potatoes are cooked to perfection in a homemade garlic butter sauce.\n\nIf you love easy chicken recipes, try my [slow cooker chicken stew](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-chicken-stew/) recipe and [slow cooker cranberry chicken](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-cranberry-chicken/) recipes.\n\n![chicken with potatoes and carrots in crockpot.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-5.jpg)\n\n \n\nWhy this recipe works\n---------------------\n\nThis recipe isn’t for the faint of heart, this is for my butter loving friends. A stick of butter flavors this meal, but the entire meal. I add garlic, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper to a stick of melted butter. I pour that garlic butter mixture over chicken, carrots, and wedges of Yukon gold potatoes.\n\nNot all slow cooker meals end up being complete meals; I usually have to make a starchy side or make a salad. With this recipe, all the main food groups are covered. The chicken is tender, and so are the veggies. My favorite thing about this meal is the potatoes. There is something about butter and potatoes together that just can’t be beaten. I hope you give this recipe a try! It’s hearty like a pot roast dinner, but with chicken instead. Have a great week. I’ll be back at the end of the week with another recipe.\n\nRecipe Ingredients\n------------------\n\n![Ingredients for garlic butter chicken and vegetables on table.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-ingredients-2.jpg)\n\n*   **Chicken tenderloins** – These cook up perfectly and soak up the garlic butter. You can use boneless skinless chicken breasts if that’s all you have.\n*   **Carrots** – Use one pound of baby carrots or one pound of carrots cut into 1 inch chunks.\n*   **Gold Potatoes** – You can use red or gold potatoes, but we LOVE gold potatoes in this recipe.\n*   **Garlic Butter Sauce** – Salted butter, fresh minced garlic, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper.\n\nStep-by-Step Directions\n-----------------------\n\n![4 steps on how to add chicken, vegetables and garlic butter sauce to slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-collage-1-1200x1200.jpg)\n\n**Step One** – In a small bowl, add the melted salted butter and add minced garlic, salt, pepper, dried thyme, and dried parsley.\n\n**Step Two** –   Place chicken tenders (or breasts) in the middle of the slow cooker. On one side of that place wedges of Yukon gold potatoes and on the other a bag of baby carrots.\n\n**Step Three** – Pour the garlic butter mixture over the chicken and veggies.\n\n**Step Four** – Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours. Serve and enjoy! Plenty of buttery sauce for everyone!\n\n![cooked garlic butter chicken in slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-2.jpg)\n\nVariations\n----------\n\n*   **Green beans** – Green beans cook up so well in the slow cooker, use them instead of the carrots for this garlic butter chicken recipe.\n*   **Easy Peasy** – Instead of making a garlic butter sauce. Use 2/3 cup of Italian dressing.\n*   **Lemon Chicken** – Add the juice of one large lemon to the garlic butter sauce. You can even add the zest of that lemon too.\n*   **Parmesan** – To make the flavor pop in this dish, sprinkle grated parmesan cheese on each individual serving.\n\n![over head shot of plate of chicken, potatoes and vegetables.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-3.jpg)\n\nRecipe FAQs\n-----------\n\n**Can I use olive oil instead of butter?**\n\nOlive oil can be used instead of butter if you are in pinch, though you won’t get as much flavor.\n\n**Can I use chicken broth instead of butter?**\n\nIf you are looking to make this a healthy meal you can use chicken broth instead of butter, or water and a chicken bouillon cube.\n\n**Can I use Italian Seasoning?**\n\nYes!

But, if you’re a fan of a creamy pasta salad, or an ultra easy-to-make pasta salad that’s loaded with healthier goodness (plus bacon!), this avocado and bacon pasta salad is for you.\n\nOnce the garden tomatoes come into harvest, BLT sandwiches are a staple at our house. And the only thing that makes them even better is adding avocado for them to become BLATs. Bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato sandwiches that are now a BBQ pasta salad staple.\n\nSo when my daughter requested I make a pasta salad that included her beloved bacon in the BLT mix, avocado was an obvious addition to make.\n\n[![BLT pasta salad ingredients in glass bowl](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1.jpg)\n\nBLT Pasta Salad Ingredients\n---------------------------\n\nI’m sure you can already guess the key ingredients in this BLT pasta salad recipe, but I added in a few more veggies to add extra pops of flavor. Instead of lettuce, I used peppery arugula, which pairs beautifully with the ranch pasta salad dressing. And I prefer using cherry tomatoes in this BLT pasta salad because they’re so juicy and hold their shape nicely.\n\nThe other ingredients you’ll need for this potluck side dish are:\n\n*   Pasta\n*   Bacon\n*   Cherry tomatoes\n*   Arugula\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Greek yogurt\n*   Mayonnaise\n*   White vinegar\n*   Chives\n*   Parsley\n*   Garlic powder\n*   Salt and pepper\n\nThe pasta salad dressing is a little healthier, because I used Greek yogurt instead of full flavored mayonnaise and sour cream. But thanks to the fresh herbs it has a totally fresh and delicious flavor.\n\nAs with any cold pasta salad, taste the dressing after you’ve whisked it together to see if it needs more salt or pepper. It’s much easier to season the dressing before it’s been tossed with the pasta!\n\n[![container of greek yogurt next to sliced red onion on counter](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002.jpg)\n\nHow to Make BLT Pasta Salad\n---------------------------\n\nTo make this homemade pasta salad, you’ll first need to cook the pasta noodles according to the package’s instructions. I tend to undercook my pasta just a bit for pasta salads so it doesn’t turn to mush as it absorbs the salad dressing.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, dice the bacon and cook it until it reaches your desired level of crispness. Note that you won’t have to oil the pan before cooking the bacon in it as the bacon will release a good amount of fat as it cooks.\n\nOnce the pasta has cooled slightly and the bacon and veggies have been prepped, add everything to a large bowl and toss to combine.\n\nNext up is the dressing. This pasta salad dressing is so easy to make, and is an easier rendition of [my homemade Ranch dressing](https://www.foodiecrush.com/homemade-ranch-dressing-recipe/) for saucing this easy pasta salad. In a separate bowl, whisk together the homemade ranch dressing. Pour the dressing over the BLT pasta salad and gently stir to distribute it.\n\n[![Homemade Ranch Dressing Recipe | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)\n\nCan I Use Fat-Free Greek Yogurt?\n--------------------------------\n\nPersonally, I would steer clear of using fat-free yogurt in this homemade pasta salad. Fat-free yogurts are often loaded with additives to make up for their flavor, and have a tendency to separate. Stick to low-fat or whole milk plain Greek yogurt for this recipe.\n\nThe Best Pastas for Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nI like this pasta salad best with a short pasta noodle, and like in my [Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/)  I use my favorite shell noodle. But, there are quite a few other types you can try, like:\n\n*   Farfalle (bowtie or butterflies)\n*   Gemelli (twists)\n*   Fusilli (springs)\n*   Campanelle (flowers)\n*   Penne (tubes)\n*   Orichette (ears)\n\nAlways cook your pasta in water that’s been generously salted. I always prefer kosher salt to regular table or iodized salt because it’s not as harsh due to its larger, flakier crystals.\n\n[![BLT Pasta Salad with Avocado | foodiecrush.com #pasta #salad #BLT #bacon #tomato #avocado #recipes](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013.jpg)\n\nCan I Prep This Pasta Salad in Advance?\n---------------------------------------\n\nI actually prefer my pasta salads to be served chilled, so yes, you can definitely prep this bacon pasta salad in advance. Just note that the longer the bacon sits in the dressing, the less crisp it will be when you serve this pasta salad.\n\nWith that said, this BLT pasta salad will be fine if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to serving it. This will give the flavors time to come together.\n\nCan I Double This BLT Pasta Salad Recipe?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re making this pasta salad for a backyard BBQ or potluck party, you can easily double the recipe if you’ll be feeding a _lot_ of people. One pound of pasta makes a lot of pasta salad, and the salad as-is serves 12 or more, but will stretch further if you’re serving other salads or side dishes along with it.\n\n[![close up of avocado and bacon pasta salad](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009.jpg)\n\nTips for Making BLT Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you’re out of ingredients or out of time to make the easy homemade dressing, feel free to use a quality bottled ranch dressing instead.\n\nWe prefer using classic pork bacon to make this BLT pasta salad, but you’re welcome to use any type of bacon you’d like.\n\nOne final note: the sliced avocado will brown as it sits in this BLT pasta salad. Personally, I don’t mind eating brown avocado (it’s perfectly safe to eat!), but if that’s something you’re worried about you can wait to stir it in until just before you serve this homemade pasta salad.\n\nMore Pasta Salad Ideas to Try\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Classic Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/) (this one always gets raves)\n*   [Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto](https://www.foodiecrush.com/craving-5-recipes-for-creamy-macaroni-salad/ \"Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto\")\n*   [Easy Italian Spaghetti Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/easy-italian-spaghetti-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Creamy Tuscan Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/tuscan-pasta-salad/)\n*   [How to Make Classic Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-classic-macaroni-salad/) (because classics always win!)\n*   [Kale Caesar Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/kale-caesar-pasta-salad/ \"Kale Caesar Pasta Salad\")\n*   [Greek Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/greek-pasta-salad-cucumbers-artichoke-hearts/)\n\n**If you mak****e this recipe, please let me know!

    "markdown": "# Spicy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls - Jessica Gavin\n_For a satisfying meal try these healthy chicken tomatillo quinoa bowls loaded with wholesome ingredients! Tender chicken is tossed in a spicy and creamy roasted tomatillo sauce for a flavor kick!_\n\n![Healthy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wholesome-chicken-tomatillo-and-quinoa-black-bean-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhen you go to your favorite Mexican restaurant are you a red sauce or green sauce fan? I used to be all about the earthy creamy red sauce poured on top of burritos, enchiladas or stewed meat. Then one day I had a change of heart when I had the most incredible plate of pork Chile Verde. I’ve been itching to learn how to make tomatillo sauce that could I use for just about any meal.\n\nToday I’m sharing a healthy chicken tomatillo bowl! You will learn how to make the sauce from scratch paired with a creamy, and spicy chicken topped on a bed of [cooked quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/). I will leave the rest of the extra toppings up to you, but at least you’ll have the essential recipe.\n\n![a sheet pan filled with green tomatillos](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fresh-tomatillos-onions-pasilla-chilis-garlic-for-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhat are Tomatillos?\n--------------------\n\nYou may have seen them hanging out next to the hot peppers in the produce aisle, but have you dared to cook with them? To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first, but I gave it a shot. Here are the basics of using tomatillos in cooking.\n\n*   Tomatillos are a member of the nightshade family. They are wrapped in a wrinkly paper husk, and once you remove the outer layer a gorgeous candy-apple green colored fruit appears. You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.\n*   Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.\n*   To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.\n\n![making green salsa with peppers and onions](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/oven-roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nThe base for the tomatillo sauce is, of course, the green fruit to add it’s characteristic tangy flavor, jalapeno, and pasilla (or poblano) peppers for heat, caramelized purple onions for sweetness and buttery roasted garlic for earthiness.\n\nCheck out how all of the fruit, vegetables, and aromatics just melt together in the pan after roasting. So many incredible flavors in one place, divine!\n\n![side by side before and after photos of sauce ingredients from solid to puree](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-before-and-after-blending-600x450.jpg)\n\nNow it’s time to bring the sauce components together! Chicken broth and fresh parsley are added to the roasted ingredients, then pureed in my Vitamix Blender until smooth.\n\nSo the first taste I took off the tomatillo salsa, it was SPICY! If you want more of a mild sauce, remove the seeds and inner membranes of the jalapenos and pasilla peppers before roasting. Or even add just one jalapeno instead of two. However once I added some yogurt to the sauce, that helped bring down the heat. This recipe makes a lot of sauce so that you can use it for another meal like [enchiladas](https://www.jessicagavin.com/chicken-enchiladas-with-pumpkin-sauce/), or even as a salsa with some crunchy chips!\n\n![chicken breasts being seared in a pan](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/spiced-sauteed-chicken-breast-600x900.jpg)\n\nLet’s talk POLLO. For the shredded chicken, I like to add a generous amount of spices for flavor, and a short [saute](https://www.jessicagavin.com/sauteing/) so that the chicken stays nice and juicy. You can bake, or poach the chicken, but I like the flavors developed on the surface from the sear with the sauteed chicken. If you are in a pinch for time, grab a roasted chicken from the store and shred away.\n\n![spoon mixing green sauce with shredded chicken](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/creamy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-1-600x900.jpg)\n\nOh yea, check out this creamy green goodness! The spicy tomatillo sauce gets combined with just a touch of plain Greek yogurt to add a creamy texture to each bite. The yogurt also helps to back the heat a bit, but it’s still got a nice kick! The sauce and the chicken get tossed together, and it’s ready for bowl customization.\n\n![top down view of two bowls of chicken tomatillo served on top of quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healthy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-bowls-with-quinoa-600x900.jpg)\n\nIt’s topping time! I like a balance of textures and making sure I get a variety of colors for extra nutritional benefits. I add sliced radishes, limes, chopped red onions, black beans, diced avocado and tomatoes to the bowl. The additional protein, fiber, and phytonutrients make this a healthy meal that you will crave!\n\n![close of up a chicken quinoa bowl](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-tomatillo-chicken-and-quinoa-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nGrab a fork and let’s dig in! If you are having guests over you can create a build-your-own chicken bowl bar and put out different toppings and even have brown rice or vegetable noodles to fill. What other tasty dishes would you add the tomatillo sauce? I would love to hear so I can try!\n\nHow do you pick ripe tomatillos?\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen tomatillos are ripe, they are juicy, firm and tart. A few guidelines when you are at the market to pick ripe tomatillos are go for smaller sizes. They tend to be a little sweeter. Slightly peel back the husk and look for bright green colored fruit. This will yield a more tangy fruit which is what you want in your dish. Pale yellow or light green tomatillo will be overripe but less tart. Touch the outside of the husk and look for it to be sticky and not dry and the fruit should fill most of the husk. Pick firm tomatillos, if it’s too soft, it’s past it’s prime.\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   ▢ 20 tomatillos\n*   ▢ 2 jalapeño peppers, stems removed\n*   ▢ 3 pasilla chilies, or poblanos, stems removed\n*   ▢ ½ red onion, cut in half\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole\n*   ▢ 1 cup unsalted chicken broth, or stock\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, packed\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons nonfat plain Greek yogurt, or lowfat sour cream\n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup quinoa\n*   ▢ 2 cups water\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to ¾-inch thick\n*   ▢ black pepper\n*   ▢ [paprika](https://www.jessicagavin.com/what-is-paprika/)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 425°F. Remove the paper off of the tomatillos and place them on a large baking pan. Add jalapeño peppers, pasilla chilies and cut red onion to the same pan.\n    \n*   Drizzle the chilies with one tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n    \n*   Place the peeled garlic in foil, lightly drizzle with oil and wrap into a packet that is open from the top, place on the corner of the baking pan. Roast chilies, onion, and garlic for 40 minutes stirring chilies after 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa and chicken.\n    \n*   Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.\n    \n*   Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.\n    \n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   Add 1 cup quinoa to a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse well with running water. Transfer to a pot with lid. Add 2 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt.\n    \n*   Bring to a boil, put a lid on then reduce to a simmer, over medium-low heat. Allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until water is absorbed, then turn off the heat. Allow it to sit with the lid on for at least 5 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork when ready to serve.\n    \n*   Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side, or until chicken is no longer pink. Transfer to a clean plate.\n    \n*   Once slightly cooled shred chicken into smaller pieces. Transfer to the saute pan that has 2 cups of tomatillo sauce. Turn heat to medium and warm chicken and sauce until hot. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons yogurt. Taste season with more salt and pepper as desired.\n    \n*   Assemble bowls with quinoa, add tomatillo chicken and other desired toppings.\n    \n\n*   **Additional Topping Suggestions**: Sliced limes, radishes, cilantro, diced onion, tomatoes, black beans, sour cream, and avocado.\n\nCalories 320kcal (16%)Carbohydrates 29g (10%)Protein 27g (54%)Fat 12g (18%)Saturated Fat 2g (10%)Polyunsaturated Fat 2gMonounsaturated Fat 7gCholesterol 71mg (24%)Sodium 1122mg (47%)Potassium 542mg (15%)Fiber 4g (16%)Sugar 5g (6%)Vitamin A 250IU (5%)Vitamin C 37.1mg (45%)Calcium 30mg (3%)Iron 3.4mg (19%)\n\nPercent Daily Values are based on a 2000-calorie diet.

    "markdown": "# Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe (Savory Japanese Pancakes) - A Food Lover's Kitchen\n*    votes\n*   [Jump to Recipe](#recipe)\n\nThis popular Japanese dish from Osaka, this **Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe** is a savory pancake made with cabbage, vegetable, meat or seafood, and a delicious sauce.\n\nIt’s not a difficult recipe to make, so trust me when I say it’s way more accessible to home cooks than it might look. In fact, there are many different styles of Okonomiyaki throughout Japan, not just one particular way of making it, so you can kind of do whatever version makes you happy, rather than worrying about getting it right.\n\n_» You are going to love these handcrafted [Japanese Gyoza!](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/homemade-japanese-gyoza/)_\n\n![Okonomiyaki\nEasy okonomiyaki recipe](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/okonomiyaki-t1.jpg)\n\nThe first time I had Okonomiyaki was at a supper club dinner. A friend of ours had just been to Japan and wanted to share this awesome dish with us. It was so good, I wanted to learn how to make it myself.\n\nA year later we went to Japan ourselves and we were obsessed with seeking out the best Okonomiyaki we could find. We learned that it comes in many variations, so we tried as many as possible. The version in this recipe has shrimp and bacon in it, but you can easily make it vegetarian or add chicken… whatever you like.\n\n![okonomiyaki batter](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-batter.jpg)\n\nDoes Okonomiyaki Require Special Ingredients?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOkonomiyaki is basically a savory pancake made with cabbage, flour, egg and water. Most of us keep those items in the kitchen at all times, so technically you can make a pretty decent okonomiyaki right now.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that make it extra special. These are somewhat specialty ingredients, that you don’t likely have on hand.\n\nFirst off, there is a special [okonomiyaki flour](https://amzn.to/2IFTg80) that is used in Japan. They also use [dashi](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi-3-ways/) for the liquid, rather than plain water. Both of these ingredients give the pancake something extra special. However, they are not necessary ingredients to make a great Okonomiyaki.\n\nThese Japanese pancakes are best served with a few key toppings, including [Okonomiyaki sauce](https://amzn.to/2xi8o4R), [Japanese mayonnaise](https://amzn.to/2X2wX5f), [bonito flakes](https://amzn.to/3UXrck4), and seaweed. I personally can get all of these items from a Japanese shop near my house, but I realize they can be difficult to find. Don’t worry.\n\nWhile these pancakes are best when served with all these toppings, it’s by no means a requirement. Below, we will suggested substitutions for the difficult to find ingredients.\n\n![spicy mayo and okonomiyaki sauce](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-sauce.jpg)\n\nHow to Make This Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe most important part of making this recipe is ensuring the cabbage is softened, since fresh cabbage contains a lot of water. You don’t want to make soggy pancakes.\n\nTo avoid this, you need to salt the cabbage and allow it to sweat off some of its water. Then rinse the salt from the cabbage and dry it thoroughly with paper towels.\n\nI also find that the cabbage is best when it’s chopped into rather small pieces – the size of a dime or slightly smaller. The larger it is, the longer it takes to cook and less surface area for the pancake to brown on the grill.\n\nMix up the batter, add the pre-sweated cabbage and other ingredients, and you’re ready to go. Pour the batter onto a hot griddle. An [electric griddle](https://amzn.to/2LUg1qr \"Electric Griddle\") like this one is perfect for the task, but you can just use a flat [crepe pan](https://amzn.to/30SoG41 \"Crepe pan\") as well.\n\nSpread out the batter to form a 5-inch round pancake. You can flatten out the batter and cabbage so it forms a flat cake, rather than a mountain, but be careful not to pack it down or press it into the grill. It needs the flow of steam to cook the cabbage properly.\n\n![cooking okonomiyaki on the griddle](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-cooking.jpg)\n\nAllow it to cook, undisturbed, for about 5 minutes. When it’s golden brown on the bottom, flip it over. It’ll need to cook an additional 5 minutes on the other side for the cabbage to cook thoroughly.\n\nWhen it’s done, remove it from the pan and cover it with your toppings of choice. I start with a drizzle of Okonomi sauce, then some mayo or [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3O69c2g \"Sriracha\") mayo (which add an extra spicy kick). You can stop there. Or you can also add bonito flakes, some scallions, seaweed flakes, etc.\n\nIf you can’t get Okonomi sauce near your home, you can get it on Amazon. You could also substitute it with a homemade sauce made from ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce and sugar.\n\n[Here’s a recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki-sauce/) I use sometimes when I don’t have the real sauce on hand. It’s also acceptable to use BBQ sauce, if you don’t want to make the effort to mix up your own sauce.\n\n![Okonomiyaki](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/okonomiyaki-w2.jpg)\n\nI’ve made this many times at home and I’m always surprised and happy with how well they turn out. They’re crispy on the outside, while still airy and light on the inside.\n\nThe cabbage gets steamed nicely while it’s on the griddle, so it’s no longer crunchy, but not soggy either.\n\nOf course, the sauce is a huge part of the equation too. Without the sauce, the pancake alone lacks luster. With the sauce, the flavors come together nicely to form one tasty pancake.\n\n### Other recipes you might like\n\n*   [BBQ Pork Belly Slices](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/bbq-pork-belly-slices-recipe/)\n*   [Vietnamese Pork Bowls](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/vietnamese-pork-bowls/)\n*   [The Best Crispy Chicken Sandwich](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/crispy-chicken-sandwich/)\n\n### YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\n**Like it, Love it, Want Some More of It?** [Subscribe to our newsletter](https://app.zagomail.com/forms/preview?id=5092) and **follow us** on **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/foodloverskitchen/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/afoodloverskitchen/)** and **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/afoodloverskitchen/)**.

It’s ready in under 20 minutes from start to finish. That’s great, especially when you know you can keep this pasta salad in the refrigerator for up to 3 days! We used rotisserie chicken to make the pasta salad, but feel free to roast or grill chicken breasts on your own or use chicken leftovers in your fridge. Put all the ingredients together in a large salad bowl and make the vinaigrette-style dressing.\n\n![Chicken Pasta Salad recipe 2](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chicken-Pasta-Salad-recipe-2.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nWhat’s the Best Pasta for the Chicken Pasta Salad? \n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWe like a classic rotini pasta salad because rotini holds the dressing pretty well, but any sturdy pasta will work! Avoid spaghetti and long pasta such as tagliatelle. Rotini, bow tie, penne, and macaroni are all good alternatives for this **chicken pasta salad recipe**.\n\n![Pasta Salad](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pasta-Salad.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nWhy you’ll love this pasta salad recipe\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   This chicken pasta salad recipe is easy to make and requires minimal cooking, making it perfect for a quick and simple meal.\n*   Combining fresh vegetables, flavorful herbs, and protein-packed chicken creates a delicious and nutritious dish.\n*   The homemade dressing adds a burst of tangy and herby flavors that perfectly compliments the other ingredients, taking this chicken pasta salad to the next level. Plus, the dressing can be customized to suit individual tastes by adjusting the amount of vinegar or seasoning used. See below for more tips about the dressing!\n\n![chicken avocado salad](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chicken-avocado-salad.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nThe Dressing for the Pasta Salad\n--------------------------------\n\nThe dressing is an important part of this pasta salad recipe. Our pasta salad dressing has only five ingredients, including salt and pepper.\n\nTo make the pasta salad dressing, whisk white wine vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, Italian seasoning, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This dressing is pretty simple, but when mixed with pasta, chicken, tomato, avocado, and other ingredients, the flavor is amazing!\n\nTo customize your pasta salad dressing, add a tablespoon of Greek yogurt, or use apple cider vinegar for a milder taste.\n\n![chicken salad dressing recipe](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chicken-salad-dressing-recipe.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![pasta salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pasta-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![best salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n**How to make chicken pasta salad:**\n\n**1.** Add the shredded chicken, pasta, onion, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and basil in a large bowl.\n\n**2.** In a jar, combine the ingredients for the dressing: vinegar, Italian seasoning, Olive oil, salt and pepper.\n\n**3.** Drizzle your chicken pasta salad with the dressing. Toss gently until all the ingredients are combined. Serve the **chicken pasta salad** immediately, or chill for later. Enjoy! ❤️\n\n![Chicken Pasta Salad recipe 3](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chicken-Pasta-Salad-recipe-3.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nTips for the chicken pasta salad\n--------------------------------\n\nThis **chicken pasta salad** is healthy, perfect for busy nights, and makes a big enough batch so you can plan for work or school lunches. Since there’s no mayo it’s great for potlucks, picnics, and parties.\n\n*   Additional add-ins that go well with this salad would include chopped cucumber, crispy bacon, corn, olives, black beans…\n*   To keep the avocado from turning brown, coat the avocado in either lemon juice or lime juice. It will act as an antioxidant.\n*   Being a **cold chicken pasta salad** makes it perfect for summer, picnics or potlucks. You can make it up to a day in advance, leaving the avocado and tomato until you are ready to serve the chicken pasta salad to keep the ingredients as fresh as possible.\n\n### Can I grill chicken instead of using rotisserie chicken?\n\nYes, of course, you can **grill chicken for this salad**. Make sure to grill chicken breasts or pan-sear on medium-low heat, so chicken doesn’t burn while undercooked in the inside. When out of fresh chicken, we like to use a bag of frozen grilled organic chicken breasts that we heat up in a skillet and use for the salad.\n\n### How to Store the Chicken Pasta Salad?\n\nThis chicken pasta salad keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days if stored in an air-tight container. Don’t keep it for more than that because the avocado will turn brown. You may have to toss the chicken pasta salad leftovers to redistribute the dressing before serving. If you want to make it ahead of time, omit the avocado, you’ll add them at the very last minute.\n\n### What other readers say about this chicken pasta salad\n\n“This was so good and the perfect lunch. Changes: I added black olives, cucumber and matchstick carrots. I forgot to add the basil and it was fine without it.” – Maureen\n\n“Just made this chicken pasta salad for our dinner. Will definitely make it again. Perfect for summer. Added some fire roasted corn and served the dressing on the side with croutons.” – Nancy\n\n“Delicious! Husband loved it!

    "markdown": "# Grilled chicken BLT salad - Simply Delicious\nJuicy grilled **chicken BLT salad** is everything you want from a salad and more. Crispy bacon, creamy avocado and punchy lemon-herb dressing all come together to make this salad recipe simply irresistible.\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad with avocado](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-3.jpg)\n\nIngredients needed\n------------------\n\n*   **Chicken.** I used boneless skinless chicken breasts but boneless chicken thighs will be delicious too. I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper.\n*   **Bacon.** I used streaky bacon.\n*   **Lettuce.** Use your favorite crisp lettuce. Romaine lettuce, Cos, etc.\n*   **Tomatoes.** Cherry tomatoes, baby tomatoes, baby plum tomatoes will all work.\n*   **Avocado.**\n*   **For the dressing:** Extra-virgin olive oil, dried oregano, fresh lemon juice, salt and black pepper.\n\nHow to make BLT salad\n---------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** Halve the chicken horizontally with a sharp knife then place in a medium bowl. Mix together the marinade ingredients and pour over the chicken. Toss to coat then allow to marinate for at least 20 minutes but up to 24 hours covered in the fridge.\n2.  **Cook the chicken and bacon:** Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium-high heat then cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. I prefer cooking the bacon in the air fryer. Alternatively bake the bacon in a hot oven until crisp or cooked to your preference.\n3.  **Assemble the salad:** Arrange lettuce on a large serving platter then top with ripe tomatoes, sliced avocado, crispy bacon and the sliced chicken. To make the dressing, combine olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and salt and pour over the salad before serving.\n\n### How to make grilled chicken for salad\n\nMake a quick marinade with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, herbs of your choice (rosemary, thyme and oregano are always a safe bet) and season generously with salt and pepper. Pour over boneless, skinless chicken breasts and allow to marinate while you heat the grill or grill pan. Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until cooked through and golden brown on both sides. The internal temperature should be 75**°**C or 165**°**F. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. You can also use **[pan fried chicken](https://simply-delicious-food.com/pan-fried-chicken-breast/)** for this recipe.\n\n### Why is it important to let meat rest after cooking?\n\nResting meat or chicken allows the juices to be redistributed throughout the meat instead of running out onto the cutting board. This is because the meat tenses up during cooking and allowing it to rest, literally allows the meat to relax and will result in juicier meat or chicken.\n\n![Grilled chicken on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-2.jpg)\n\nCan I make this ahead?\n----------------------\n\nThe chicken can be marinated for up to 24 hours in the fridge. Cooked chicken can be kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To prep the salad in advance, I would keep the dressing separate as it will cause the lettuce to wilt. Slice the avocado and dress the salad right before serving.\n\nWhat to serve with blt chicken salad\n------------------------------------\n\nThis salad is a fantastic gluten-free/keto meal on its own. If you want to add side dishes, a loaf of **[crusty bread](https://simply-delicious-food.com/easy-crusty-bread-recipe/)** is always delicious with salad.\n\n![Easy lemon-herb dressing on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-4.jpg)\n\n*   **[BBQ chicken salad with charred corn](https://simply-delicious-food.com/bbq-chicken-salad-with-charred-corn/)**\n*   [**Greek chicken salad**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/greek-chicken-salad/)\n*   [**Peri-Peri chicken salad with charred corn**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/peri-peri-chicken-salad/)\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blt-chicken-salad-3-2-266x266.jpg)\n\n#### For the grilled chicken\n\n*   4 chicken breasts boneless + skinless\n*   2 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   2 garlic cloves crushed\n*   1 tsp salt\n*   ½ tsp black pepper\n\n#### For the salad\n\n*   8 strips streaky bacon cooked to your preference\n*   lettuce\n*   baby tomatoes halved\n*   1 avocado sliced\n\n#### For the lemon-herb dressing\n\n*   3 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   salt and pepper to taste\n\n*   Combine all the marinade ingredients and mix well. Pour over the chicken and allow to marinade while you pre-heat the grill or grill pan on the stove.\n    \n*   Cook the the chicken for 4-5 minutes per side (depending on thickness) until cooked through and golden brown on both sides.\n    \n*   Remove from the heat and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing.\n    \n*   To assemble the salad, add a bed of lettuce to serving plates and top with tomatoes, sliced avocado, crispy bacon and sliced chicken.\n    \n*   Mix together the dressing ingredients then drizzle over the salad before serving.\n    \n\nCalories: 375kcal | Carbohydrates: 6g | Protein: 26g | Fat: 28g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 73mg | Sodium: 735mg | Potassium: 662mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 105IU | Vitamin C: 12.6mg | Calcium: 22mg | Iron: 0.9mg\n\nMore delicious bacon recipes\n----------------------------\n\n1.

Same delicious recipe!_\n\nI don’t think I could ever tire of strawberries. And with strawberry season here and gone so quickly, we must take advantage!\n\nHere in the Midwest, summertime is a constant reminder to truly take things in. To enjoy the days as they are. To accept both the hot (often humid here) weather and the thunderstorms. To take advantage of the long days and spend more time with one another. To get outside and enjoy nature and the blue skies before it gets cold and gray again.\n\nEven though the days are longer, these months do not last long, and I’m finding that summer teaches us to be more present.

They’re just the wonderful result of what happens when you take the basics and then add a twist here and a switcheroo there, all depending on what’s fresh and seasonal and hanging out in the fridge. This chicken spinach salad is exactly one of those recipes and finds itself as my lucky lunch at least once a week.\n\nIt’s loaded with heart healthy baby spinach, sliced sweet strawberries, creamy avocado, and a simple dressing that does double duty as the chicken marinate. Cook the chicken on the stove top or on the grill and you have a salad made for filling lunches or easy dinners.\n\nIsn’t that the perfect reason to share?\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-012.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-012.jpg)\n\nWhat’s in This Strawberry Spinach Salad?\n----------------------------------------\n\nTo make this avocado, spinach, and strawberry chicken salad, you’ll need:\n\n*   Extra virgin olive oil\n*   Golden balsamic vinegar\n*   Sugar\n*   Fresh tarragon\n*   Kosher salt and pepper\n*   Chicken breasts\n*   Fresh spinach\n*   Strawberries\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Feta cheese\n*   Sliced almonds\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-020.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-020.jpg)\n\nHow to Make a Spinach and Strawberry Salad\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhisk together the balsamic dressing and pour half over the chicken. Set the chicken aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes.\n\nOnce the chicken has had time to soak up some flavor, grill until done. Then, it’s just a matter of assembling the strawberry spinach salad and digging in!\n\nCan I Use Another Leafy Green?\n------------------------------\n\nI always have fresh spinach in the fridge, where it finds its way into everything from my [breakfast fritattas](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-and-mushroom-egg-white-frittata/), to my lightened up [sweet green smoothies](https://www.foodiecrush.com/immune-booster-sweet-green-smoothie/) and [spinach lasagna](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-lasagna-roll-ups/).  So it’s a natural base for this hearty salad, that works for lunch or dinner even.\n\nBut if you have kale, arugula, romaine, butter or even spring mix mingling in the crisper, by all means, use it up!\n\nCan I Use Another Berry?\n------------------------\n\nThe ying and yang of sweet strawberries with red onion and avocado is one of my favorite combos ever. However, you can always swap out raspberries or blueberries for the strawberries and instead of feta, give goat cheese a try. I have and likely will again.\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | #spinach #recipe #balsamic #chicken #healthy foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTips for Making Strawberry Spinach Salad\n----------------------------------------\n\n**I like to cook a few chicken breasts on Sunday or Monday** to eat during the week in salads like this. I’ve shared how to cook them on the stove top below, but if you’re ready to grill, [this technique](https://www.foodiecrush.com/the-best-grilled-chicken-breast-recipe-and-a-giveaway/) is always a grilled chicken success.\n\n**This balsamic tarragon dressing is my standard, go-to-all-the-time salad dressings.** I use white balsamic dressing because it’s a bit mellower and doesn’t dominate the flavor of the salad, instead letting all of the other flavors shine through.\n\n**The dressing does double duty as a chicken marinade too.** Remember that after marinating chicken to discard the marinade. You do NOT want to use it for the dressing after soaking in raw chicken.

Here, I’ve included the method used by restaurants to get that ideal, slightly dried-out rice without having to wait a day. The YouTube channel [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChineseCookingDemystified/) is one of my favorite places to go for all my Chinese culinary questions. The method that its hosts Steph and Chris use to par-boil then steam the rice is borderline miraculous in the results you get. The Delish kitchen team was floored at the consistent texture you get with the rice, and I for one will not be cooking my rice any other way going forward.  \n• **Oil:** Choose an oil with a high-smoke point, and don’t be afraid to use a lot of oil—this is fried rice after all.  \n• **Eggs**: I use 3 large eggs in this recipe. I prefer to have some white streaks in my eggs, so I barely beat them together.  \n• **Garlic:** I like my fried rice super garlicky, so I use 5 cloves. You can take it back if you want, but honestly, I don’t suggest it—the more garlic, the better.  \n• **Ginger:** About an inch of ginger, minced very small, goes with the garlic before adding in our veggies.  \n• **Scallions:** When chopping your scallions, separate the whites and the greens. The green we’ll use as a garnish, and the white we’ll cook with.  \n• **Soy Sauce:** The first thing you’ll notice about this recipe is that soy sauce is included. While to some, this might not be super-traditional in fried rice, a lot of American eaters (and Delish taste testers) prefer it! Because there is no meat or seafood in this fried rice, after some testing, I felt it added some extra body and umami to the rice that is totally delicious. I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce so you can control the salt amount.  \n• **Sugar:** I believe that all savory dishes should be finished off with a bit of sugar if there isn’t a natural source of sweetness in it. It helps to round out the dish and provide a more complex flavor.  \n• **White Pepper:** White pepper is underutilized outside of fancier kitchens, but it’s worth buying if you can. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite things about this recipe; at home, I’ll add even more. It’s earthy, and has less of a kick than black pepper.  \n• **MSG:** MSG adds the perfect sweet-salty boost to fried rice. It’s a widely misunderstood ingredient—checkout this article all about [MSG](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35119070/msg-monosodium-glutamate/) if you’re looking to learn more.  \n• **Peas:** I personally love peas in fried rice, and find it’s a common addition in many American versions. Don’t worry about using frozen peas, they won’t emit too much moisture to the rice.  \n• **Butter:** Using butter is a bit controversial, but it adds a wonderful richness, and a little bit goes a long way. If you really don’t want to use it, you can omit it.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nLeftover rice works perfectly for fried rice, so if you have some hanging out in your fridge, use it here. But, if you don’t have any, never fear: I’ve found a 2-step technique to make freshly cooked rice absolutely perfect for fried rice. The first step of making any rice dish is to adequately clean your rice. Some people like to do this in the pot they’re going to cook their rice in, but I like to use a mesh strainer. Rinse the rice—moving around the grains frequently—until the water comes out clean.\n\nOnce your rice is ready, you’re going to par-boil the rice for just a few minutes. This will help to jumpstart the cooking process, breaking down the outsides of the grains of rice.\n\nOnce you strain the rice, we’re ready to make an impromptu steamer with a pot and a strainer that fits inside of it. First, add some water to the bottom of the pot, then put the strainer filled with your rinsed rice in it. Next, you’re going to want to create some holes in the rice with chopsticks to allow steam to circulate.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9983579638752053xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter making your holes, cover the pot with tin foil; it doesn’t have to be totally snug, but it should be well-tented. Then, cover with the pot lid and let it steam. Steaming the rice is a gentler cooking process that keeps the grains pretty dry and adds less moisture to the rice, which is what we’re looking for.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, check on your rice: It should almost taste al-dente. What I mean by this is that it should be fully cooked through, but should taste drier than normal steamed rice. Once it’s ready, I like to spread my rice on a sheet pan. This is a bit of overkill, but it will help your rice to cool down more quickly (which means fried rice faster!).\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNow that our rice is ready, let’s focus on bringing everything together. A wok is the most traditional way to cook fried rice, and it does work especially well. The movement and centralized heat are very helpful, and its size holds a large amount of rice . But if you don’t have one, don’t let that stop you: I’ve made incredible fried rice in a cast iron skillet.\n\nBarely beat the eggs together (if you prefer some whites in your egg) before adding to your wok. Once you add to the wok, move your eggs around quickly, pressing in with a spatula to make those perfect fried rice egg squiggles. Once they’re ready, take them out, and give your wok a quick wipe down. I recommend pre-cooking your eggs because if they sit in the fried rice for awhile, they will get overcooked.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNext, it’s time to add your oil. Don’t be shy here: This is fried rice after all, so add enough to coat all of the grains in the oil. Add in your ginger and garlic: This will help flavor the oil which will transfer to your entire dish. Then, add the green onions and cook until softened, flipping and stirring frequently to prevent any burning.\n\nAdd all of your rice, tossing and stirring it constantly (I mean it!). You should see the grains start to become individual, which is the tell-tale sign of a well-done fried rice. Once you see that the rice is separating, it’s time to add your seasonings and soy sauce.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nOnce your rice is perfectly seasoned and separated, it’s time to add in your eggs and peas.

    "markdown": "# Baked Zucchini Fries with Parmesan KETO, LOW CARB | Best Recipe Box\nOur Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries recipe is low carb and keto friendly. Learn how to make healthy zucchini fries instead of potatoes for a less guilty snack. These are so flavorful! \n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries on a cutting board ](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-2.jpg \"Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox\")\n\nEasy Baked Zucchini Fries Recipe\n--------------------------------\n\nWhat to do when life gives you a ton of zucchini? Make baked parmesan zucchini fries! And more of it please! It’s really a fantastic way to use up zucchini when you run out of zucchini recipe ideas. When you’re craving fries, without all the starch from potatoes, using zucchini is a fabulous way to satisfy those cravings without all the calories. It’s mind blowing how delicious and easy these zucchini fries are. And it’s even more mind blowing why we didn’t make them earlier because they’re low carb, no bread crumbs and tasty!\n\n**Video: Healthy Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries** \n-------------------------------------------------\n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries on a cutting board ](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-1.jpg \"Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox\")\n\nZucchini Fries Recipe with No Bread Crumbs KETO\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*   The flavors are outstanding. We add parmesan, some paprika, fresh herbs and other spices to really add amazing flavor to the humble zucchini sticks. They’re simply delicious and a perfect zucchini fry appetizer for anytime you’re wanting a simple dish to have a party.\n*   Add some extra onion powder for another kick of flavor.\n*   Have you tried steak seasoning? It’s not just for steak! This seasoning is really great on the zucchini.\n*   Even beyond a great finger food, they’re definitely lighter than potatoes. These zucchini fries are baked and all the wonderful flavors get cooked into the zucchini. Each bite is wonderful and low carb!\n*   All recipe details are in the recipe box below.\n\n### Keto Coating Options\n\nThere’s several more options for keto “bread crumbs” other than the parmesan cheese that we use.\n\n*    Crushed pork rinds are probably the most common and popular. You can buy these pre-crushed and ready to use. Or you can buy a bag of pork rinds and then grind them in your food processor. This option allows you to customize the grind of your pork rinds. You can make the coating find or more coarse/crunchy.\n*   Almond flour is another popular option. But we find that the parmesan cheese and crushed pork rinds will result in the most crispy outside texture. If you don’t use enough oil spray on the outside of the almond flour, the crust can be rather mushy and dry.\n*   Sesame seeds are another option. You’ll get a great flavor of sesame on the zucchini.\n\n### Can You Make this Ahead of time?\n\nYou can make these ahead, but they’ll be pretty soggy the next day. Best way to crisp them up is in a toaster oven or [air fryer](https://bestrecipebox.com/air-fryer-zucchini/). Add a light oil spray over them so they don’t dry out during heating.\n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-1-250x250.jpg)\n\nBaked Parmesan Zucchini Fries\n-----------------------------\n\nYield: 6 servings\n\nPrep Time: 5 minutes\n\nCook Time: 18 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 23 minutes\n\nThese are so good, not \"crispy\" becuase they're healthy but still tasty. There's no bread crumbs so they're a little healthier than most zucchini fries recipes and less crispy. If you want them crispy and not keto, add bread crumbs to the coating, then spray the outside before baking.\n\n*   1 1/2 lbs. (680 g) zucchini ,cut lengthwise into wedges (about 3 medium zucchini)\n*   1/2 cup (50 g) freshly grated Parmesan\n*   1 teaspoon (5 ml) dried herbs – thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, etc…\n*   1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) smoked paprika\n*   1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) garlic powder\n*   [Kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2LzFKoG) , to taste\n*   black pepper , to taste (freshly ground if possible)\n*   2 tablespoons (30 ml) [olive oil](https://amzn.to/2uMlvKN)\n*   3 tablespoons (45 ml) chopped fresh parsley leaves\n\n*   Preheat oven to 400° F. Line baking sheet with parchment or aluminum foil. Spray with non-stick cooking spray.\n    \n*   In bowl, combine Parmesan, dried herbs, smoked paprika and garlic powder salt and pepper, to taste.\n    \n*   Toss the zucchini with olive oil and roll in parmesan/herb mixture to coat all sides. Place zucchini onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with extra parmesan/herb mixture if needed.\n    \n*   Bake until crisp, about 15 minutes. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown.\n    \n    Garnish with parsley.

While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n\n![Collage showing how to make walnut pesto before and after blending in food processor](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-Collage1.jpg)\n\n### To assemble the sandwiches\n\nYou will need some **sourdough bread** sliced about ½ inch thick, **whole mozzarella cheese**, the **pesto** you just successfully whipped up, along with large **tomato slices and roasted red pepper**.\n\n![Ingredients to make the recipes: bread, pesto, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-3-640x427.jpg)\n\nNext, you’ll want to **spread the pesto** on four slices of the sourdough bread, and place two of the slices right on the panini maker with the pesto side up.\n\n![Spreading walnut pesto on the bread before assembling and grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-4-640x427.jpg)\n\nThe assembly all happens in the panini maker, [like this one](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) (or toaster oven or grill pan). Add the mozzarella cheese on right away, and give it a minute to settle in and start melting. Start piling the tomatoes and roasted red peppers (carefully).\n\n![Two open faced sandwiches in the panini topped with tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-5-640x427.jpg)\n\nAnd then, **close the sandwich with the remaining bread** (pesto side down) and close the panini maker. This is seriously the hardest part of the recipe. The type of bread you use and how high you stack the sandwich can really make or break the sandwich. You want to **lightly press on the sandwich** so we don’t end up with a pressed pile of cheesy bread (although I have done it and it is delicious still haha!)\n\n![Sandwich assembled in the panini before grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-6-640x427.jpg)\n\nYou’ll know it’s done when the bread is crispy and golden brown and the mozzarella cheese is melty. It’s a sandwich recipe that looks totally gourmet and tastes out of this world!\n\n![Sandwich after coming off the panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-7.jpg)\n\nTips for making grilled mozzarella sandwich\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Don’t have a panini maker?** [This panini maker](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) is great, or you can use a toaster oven to achieve the same result (minus those pretty grill lines). You can also use a grill pan or regular pan to make this sandwich recipe.\n2.  **Don’t have a food processor?** Just buy store-bought pesto! But really, if you can find a way to make your own pesto, it really takes this sandwich to another level.\n3.  Make sure you use the **freshest ingredients** you can for maximum flavor. That is especially true for the basil and the mozzarella cheese.\n4.  **Use thick sturdy sourdough bread** that is not airy on the inside to ensure the sandwich stays put when you press on it in the panini maker.\n\n![Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich made with walnut pesto, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-8.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Is a grilled mozzarella sandwich healthy?\n\nOne sandwich comes in at under 450 calories, so even though it’s not low in calories, it’s certainly **better for you than a lot of store bought sandwiches**. Making your own pesto is certainly a healthier option than buying store bought because there aren’t preservatives or milk or other unnecessary ingredients added. To make the sandwich lighter, you can use whole wheat bread which contains more fiber, and you can use a low fat mozzarella if you so wish.\n\n### How do you make homemade walnut pesto?\n\nPesto is so easy to make at home. We are all so used to buying the jarred stuff, but fresh is always better! Use a **good olive oil, super fresh basil leaves (or any greens really) and some nuts**. Add the dry ingredients to a food processor, and while they are combining, slowly pour in the olive oil. Easy! Be sure to make an extra batch and stir it into fresh pasta!\n\n![Mozzarella Grilled Sandwich stacked with basil on the side](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-9.jpg)\n\nFor more delicious sandwich recipes:\n------------------------------------\n\n*   [Turkey Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/turkey-panini/)\n*   [Roasted Vegetable Grilled Cheese Sandwich](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Pesto Chicken Avocado Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/pesto-chicken-avocado-panini/)\n*   [Cheesy Chicken & Broccoli Wraps](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/cheesy-chicken-broccoli-wraps/)\n\nI really hope you enjoy this grilled mozzarella sandwich recipe as much as we did!

While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n    \n*   Spread the pesto equally on the 4 slices of bread and place two slices of bread on the panini maker or in a toaster oven for 2 minutes.\n    \n*   Then place the mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers on top of two bread slices and allow the cheese to melt and the veggies to soften, keeping the panini maker open.\n    \n*   Once the cheese starts to melt, add the second slices on top to close the sandwiches, then close the panini maker for 2-3 minutes. Remove, slice in half and serve immediately\n    \n\n**Storage:** Leftover pesto should be covered and stored in the refrigerator, it will keep fresh for one week. I would not recommend storing the sandwich though for more than a couple hours. If you have sandwich leftovers, it’s best to reheat using a toaster oven or panini maker.\n\n**Make Ahead Tips:** You can make the pesto up to one week in advance and then use in the the grilled sandwich when you’re ready.\n\n**Substitutes:** For best results, follow the recipe as is. However here are some common substitutes that would work well in this recipe.\n\n*   _Instead whole mozzarella_, you can use shredded mozzarella. Although I think it creates a completely different flavor and texture to the sandwich.\n*   _Instead of walnuts_, you can use other nuts, like pine nuts, almonds or pecans, to make the pesto\n\n**Equipment**: I use the [Kitchen Aid 7-Cup Food processor](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KFP0718CU-7-Cup-Processor-Puree/dp/B07BVYPDJ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=30RV8LXKUP8I8&keywords=kitchenaid+7+cup+food+processor&qid=1552749952&s=gateway&sprefix=kitchen+aid+7+cup,aps,240&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=feelgoodfoodie-20&linkId=35c757d4f7499b6121fbed25a3cbd49d&language=en_US) [Kitchen Aid 11-Cup Food Processor](https://amzn.to/2Qe4KFo) to to make the pesto. It has a high and low pulse speed so you can make the pesto as smooth or chunky as you’d like. And it has a 3-in-1 wide mouth feed tube to make it easier to slowly add olive oil while the machine is running.\n\nIt’s so fun to make sandwiches in my panini maker. I have the [Cuisinart 5-in-1 Griddler](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-GR-4N-Griddler-Silver-Black/dp/B002YD99Y4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1542920577&sr=1-3&keywords=panini+press&linkCode=ll1&tag=feelgoodfoodie-20&linkId=e26e82b7b800340cdaa315d148d53165&language=en_US) – pretty much a magic appliance in my kitchen that does so much! If you don’t have a panini grill, you can use a skillet and cook the sandwich for 2 minutes per side, pressing down with a spatula as you cook.\n\nServing: 1g, Calories: 449kcal, Carbohydrates: 41g, Protein: 16g, Fat: 25g, Saturated Fat: 6g, Cholesterol: 24mg, Sodium: 742mg, Potassium: 302mg, Fiber: 2g, Sugar: 3g, Vitamin A: 960IU, Vitamin C: 16.1mg, Calcium: 224mg, Iron: 3mg\n\nNutrition information provided is an estimate.

We have spent it almost entirely doing wall prep (3 days!!) and painting (1 day) our guest bedroom and we were dead people walking at the end of yesterday. When we ventured out for dinner last night, we were so tired that we were barely able to keep our eyes open.\n\nIt was really hard work, but it paid off – the room already looks ten times better and it’s not even finished yet. We are nearly done with the ceiling and the walls (the 3rd and final coat of paint goes on tomorrow), but the skirting boards and the radiator will need to wait until our guests leave, as we don’t want to poison them with paint fumes. My brother and his partner are visiting us this Friday and, especially after the weekend we’ve had, we are really looking forward to spending some relaxing time with them. We have not seen each other for ages and they recently returned from some exciting travels, so we cannot wait to catch up and hear all they’ve been up to.\n\nWhile Duncan and myself are more into sweet kind of breakfasts, I know that my brother especially prefers a savoury brekkie. So I’ve been thinking about what I could make for him and this simple vegan breakfast bowl is what I came up with. It’s a dish that marries a lot of leftovers together and it isn’t worse for it.\n\nI used already cooked and cooled potatoes, which I pan-fried in a little olive oil. I charred some cherry toms under a hot grill until they split open and became jammy and delicious (beware as they stay dangerously hot for ages!!). I wilted some spinach that wasn’t fresh enough to put in a salad anymore and finally made vegan scrambled eggs from some silken tofu, flavoured with aromatics and magical black salt, which due to its high sulphur content, makes tofu taste like eggs.\n\nIt may sound very niche and fancy, but it’s a staple of Indian cuisine, so if you live in the UK, a well-stocked Indian-run corner store is a great place to get it. While it’s called black salt (or [kala namak](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak)), it is dusty pink when ground up fine, so keep your eyes open for that. This dish is filling, full of contrasting textures and flavours and super quick to put together. It will make an awesome savoury breakfast or brunch and I am hoping that it will make our non-vegan guests happy.\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl ingredients](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-ingredients.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl potatoes](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-potatoes.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl portion](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-portion-800x1200.jpg)\n\n*   olive oil\n*   a bunch of cherry tomatoes on the vine\n*   250 g / 9 oz cooked and cooled small potatoes, halved\n*   salt to taste\n*   black pepper, to taste\n*   100 g / 3.5 oz baby spinach\n*   1 large shallot, finely diced\n*   1 garlic clove, finely diced\n*   300 g / 10.5 oz silken firm tofu (I use [Clearspring](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/silken-tofu))\n*   ¼ tsp turmeric, adjust to taste\n*   ¼ tsp [black salt](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak) (has eggy taste), adjust to taste\n*   ½ ripe avocado, cut in half\n\nMETHOD\n\n1.  Brush tomatoes with a little oil (keeping them on the vine if you can) and place them on a small baking tray. Stick them under a grill / broiler for 5-10 minutes, until their skins burst and the tops char a little. Season and set aside.\n2.  Heat up 2 tsp of olive oil on a small frying pan. Place cold potatoes, cut side down on the hot oil and allow them to fry gently until nicely browned. Season with salt and pepper.\n3.  Place spinach on another pan with a splash of water. Allow the spinach to wilt using gentle heat. Move it around the pan with a pair of tongs. Season and lift wilted spinach out of the pan, draining any excess water away.\n4.  Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan (I reused the one I used to wilt the spinach) and fry diced shallot and garlic on a very gentle heat.\n5.  Once shallot is translucent and garlic fragrant (but not browned), add the drained tofu. Smash it a little with the back of a spoon. Season with turmeric, black salt (it will give it eggy taste) and pepper.\n6.  Divide all the elements (including the avocado) between two bowls and drizzle with extra olive oil if needed."

This shrimp avocado salad is **healthy, filling, satisfying, and light**. It's a well-balanced meal that combines veggies (avocado and arugula), protein (shrimp), a small amount of your favorite fruit (I used mango), and nuts (I used pine nuts). It's **super-versatile and flexible**, and you can use a wide variety of ingredients and substitutions (see more on that below the recipe card). I've made it so many times this Summer because it definitely became one of my family's most requested salads! This recipe is a great way to dress up and give so much flavor to **the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp**. Or cook raw shrimp from scratch using one of my recipes: [shrimp scampi with capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/) or [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n\nCrowd-pleasing Summer salad\n---------------------------\n\nThis light and refreshing salad takes under 20 minutes to make, which is great for busy weeknights. You only need **6 main ingredients** - shrimp, avocado, spinach, mango, pine nuts, and red onions.  The salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). Shrimp avocado salad also makes a stunning presentation - perfect for sharing with the crowd! **Bring this Summer salad to picnics, potlucks, barbecue parties, and other outdoor Summer festivities.** Or, serve it indoors for those special occasions when you want to impress your guests without spending too much time in the kitchen.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-1-1.jpg \"Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.\")\n\nIs it a healthy salad?\n----------------------\n\n*   **Packed with nutrients.** Shrimp avocado salad combines so many good-for-you ingredients. It's highly nutritious, packed with fiber and protein, and low in calories. It's gluten-free and dairy-free. It's also pescatarian - perfect for vegetarians who incorporate seafood into their diets.  It will make a delicious healthy addition to the list of your family's favorites.\n*   **Shrimp** is naturally low in carbs and rich in protein. It's low-fat but the fat that it does provide is a good kind of fat (beneficial omega-3 fatty acids).\n*   **Avocado** is packed with healthy fats and is a great source of vitamins B6, C,  E, and K. It also provides folate, magnesium, potassium, and copper.\n*   **Mango** is an excellent source of vitamin C.\n*   **Arugula** is rich in Vitamins A, C, and K, and is a great source of calcium, potassium, and folate.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-recipe-1-1-300x300.jpg)\n\nShrimp Avocado Salad is a quick and easy **Mediterranean-style recipe** that makes a great side salad, lunch, or light dinner.

You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.\n*   **Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.\n*   **Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad. I recommend mango, peaches, nectarines, and apricots. You can also add citrus fruit which will pair well with shrimp, such as oranges, mandarine oranges, or grapefruit.\n*   **Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice.\n\nTips for Success\n----------------\n\n*   **Use pre-cooked shrimp.** It saves so much time, and this avocado salad is just a great way to dress up the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp.\n*   **Any size of shrimp works.** I do prefer to use large, but this is a great recipe to use up smaller cooked shrimp!\n*   **Cook shrimp from scratch.** If you have raw shrimp, simply cook it on the stovetop. Here is a nice, light recipe for [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/).\n*   **Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!\n*   **Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.\n\nHow to tell if an avocado is ripe?\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.\n*   **An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.\n\nMake-ahead tips\n---------------\n\n*   If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.\n*   Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.\n\nMore shrimp recipes\n-------------------\n\n*   [Garlic Butter Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/garlic-butter-shrimp/)\n*   [Shrimp Scampi with Capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n*   [Honey-Mustard Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/honey-mustard-garlic-shrimp/)\n*   [Lemon Shrimp Orzo](https://juliasalbum.com/lemon-shrimp-orzo-asparagus/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime and Black Bean Rice Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-black-bean-shrimp-and-rice/)\n\nOther healthy salads you might like\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   [Apple Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/apple-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Holiday Salad with Spinach, Mandarin Oranges, Pecans, Cranberries, Goat Cheese, and Honey-Mustard Lime Vinaigrette](https://juliasalbum.com/holiday-salad/)\n*   [Peach Blueberry Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/peach-blueberry-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Berry Spinach Salad with Blueberries, Raspberries, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/berry-spinach-salad-with-blueberries-raspberries/)\n*   [Strawberry Spinach Salad with Feta cheese, Pecans, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/strawberry-spinach-salad-recipe/)\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

In fact, I didn’t tell anyone I made these because I am selfish like that.\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903_121134-2.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nIf you have never had Delicata Squash, boy oh boy, you are in for a treat, and I highly suggest you get your bottom down to the grocery store right now and grab a couple (or 10).  It’s lighter in flavor than any of the other squashes around.  I don’t know about you guys with kids, but squash is pretty much the only thing that my kids don’t like eating.  Well not delicata.   It is the first thing off their plates.\n\nMy favorite thing about this squash though has to be the fact that you don’t have to peel it.  Yup, that’s right!  You can eat the skin of these bad boys!  Well technically you can eat the skin of any winter squash, but it probably won’t be that tasty.  Don’t worry though, this skin is delicious!\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Roasted-Delicata-Squash.png?resize=640%2C960&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nWhat I love about delicata squash is that you can put ANY seasonings you feel like sprinkling on there and it will be out of this world good.  Here are a few of my favorite seasoning blends for it….\n\n1.  [PRIMAL PALATE](https://www.primalpalate.com/organic-spices/ref/88/) French Onion blend.\n2.  My ranch blend from [HERE](https://pretenditsadonut.com/2018/01/16/sheet-pan-ranch-pork-loin/)\n3.

So that’s a plus!\n\nROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\n\nIngredients\n\n*   2 medium Delicata Squash, sliced 1/8 of an inch thick\n*   2 tbl avocado oil\n*   squeeze of lime\n*   Fresh cilantro for garnish\n\nSPICE BLEND:\n\n*   1 tbl paprika\n*   1 1/2 tsp chipotle powder\n*   1 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n*   1 tsp cumin\n*   1 tsp sea salt\n\nCHIPOTLE AIOLI:\n\n*   1/4 cup mayonnaise\n*   1 tsp spice blend\n*   1 tsp lime juice\n\nInstructions\n\n1.

This arugula citrus salad is filled with so many feel-good ingredients, and is the perfect lunch to serve as is or with a grilled piece of protein.\n\nIt’s filled with crunchy toasted almonds, fresh orange slices, tricolor quinoa, and hearty chickpeas. The salad is tossed in a homemade citrus vinaigrette, and is seriously the perfect spring salad!\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13FE18F3-23DF-477F-AE22-ECF1609DE7BC-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThere are so many ways to prepare delicious hearty salads, but sometimes they can get repetitive. Here are a few tips to make the best salads at home:\n\n1.  Add a grain- grains add such a hearty component to salads, and can take them from a side dish to a main meal\n2.  Add a crunch- you’ll rarely ever see me eating a salad without some form of nuts or seeds added. They add such a delicious crunch and help give texture to your salads. Toasting the nuts is an extra step, but adds the most rich flavor!\n3.  Add canned beans- canned beans are an affordable way to add more flavor, fiber and protein to your salads. My go-to’s are usually chickpeas and cannellini beans since they’re subtle tasting and work well with so many flavors\n4.  Finish it off with cheese! Whether you use dairy or vegan cheese, the saltiness provides delicious depth of flavor and adds a little more heartiness to your salad\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/683056D7-F6A4-4A70-8124-07DE41DDBAD0-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What you’ll need to make this arugula citrus salad:**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Arugula- the arugula keeps this salad light and fresh. It’s the perfect base for this citrus salad\n*   Quinoa- I love adding quinoa to this salad, but other grains that would also work well are farro, barley, or pearled couscous\n*   Avocado- a slightly firm avocado is ideal for any salad since it will keep its shape and still have flavor\n*   Oranges- for added freshness and sweetness\n*   Chickpeas- for a boost of fiber and protein\n*   Crumbled cheese- feta is my go-to for salads, but feel free to swap any cheese of choice\n*   Homemade citrus vinaigrette\n\n![](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06007365-5420-479E-BCE8-C39099F47B57-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThe sweet, salty and savory flavors in this salad work so well together. It’s delicious on its own as a light lunch, but I love serving it with a grilled piece of salmon for an added boost of protein.\n\nThis salad is so simple to make, easily customizable, and is the perfect way to eat more salads this season!\n\n![arugula salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/F6E723C9-4EC3-421E-AFFE-633FC3A3AACD-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What to serve with your arugula citrus salmon:**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Honey Jalapeno Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-jalapeno-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pasta with Roasted Asparagus](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pasta-with-roasted-asparagus/)\n\n### [Honey Za’atar Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-zaatar-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pepper Tofu](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pepper-tofu/)\n\nArugula Citrus Salad\n--------------------\n\nCourse: Main\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1/2 cup 1/2 uncooked quinoa\n    \n*   1 cup 1 vegetable broth or water\n    \n*   5 oz 5 arugula, about 5-6 cups\n    \n*   1 can 1 chickpeas, drained (15 oz)\n    \n*   2 medium 2 avocados, slightly firm is ideal- cut into cubes\n    \n*   1 1 orange, peeled and chopped\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 slivered almonds\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 crumbled feta cheese\n    \n*   **Citrus Vinaigrette**\n*   1/4 cup 1/4 olive oil\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 orange juice\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 lemon juice\n    \n*   1 clove 1 garlic, crushed\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 dijon mustard\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 pure maple syrup\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 chopped red onion or shallots\n    \n*   Salt & pepper\n    \n\n### Directions\n\n*   Add the quinoa and vegetable broth to a sauce pan and bring it to a boil.

I promise it’s super easy and takes just a few steps! Check out my answers to some common questions below:\n\n**How do you cut up zucchini?**\n\nI recommend cutting zucchini lengthwise into long strips. Remove the ends off the zucchini and cut into 1/3-inch or 1/2-inch slices.\n\nDepending on the size of your zucchini, you’ll end up with 3-4 strips per vegetable.\n\n**Should you salt zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYes! I definitely recommend salting the cut up strips of zucchini prior to grilling them. Simply sprinkle them with salt, then let them sit for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe salt will pull out a lot of the water in the zucchini, which you can pat off before putting them on the grill. This will help prevent a watery mess!\n\n**Do you peel zucchini before grilling?**\n\nNever :). I always suggest to leave the zucchini skins on. The skins of fruits + veggies often contain a TON of the nutrients and fibre. You don’t want to miss out on it!\n\n**Should you oil zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYup! I recommend brushing both sides of each zucchini slice with a little bit of olive or [avocado oil](https://www.walderwellness.com/recommends/avocado-oil/) before placing them on the grill. This helps to prevent the zucchini from drying out and sticking to the grill.\n\n![overhead shot of wood cutting board with zucchini, honey, goat cheese, and basil](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-1-683x1024.jpg)\n\nIs Grilled Zucchini Healthy?\n----------------------------\n\nYou bet! Zucchini is not only delicious, but it’s jam-packed with nutrition benefits, too.\n\nZucchini is rich in many **micronutrients**, like:\n\n*   **vitamin A**\n*   **vitamin C**\n*   **vitamin K**\n*   **vitamin** **B6**\n*   **folate**\n*   **manganese**\n*   **magnesium**\n*   **potassium**\n*   **copper**\n\nThis summer squash is also a great source of **dietary fibre**, with one medium zucchini providing 2 grams or 8% of your daily fibre needs.\n\nLike other fruits and veggies, zucchini is also a great source of **antioxidants**, especially carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin.\n\n![light blue plate with grilled zucchini slices topped with crumbled goat cheese, basil and honey](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-2-683x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat To Pair With Grilled Zucchini\n----------------------------------\n\nNeed some ideas to make this grilled zucchini a full meal?

Perfect for summer bbq’s and picnics!_ \n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nHey y’all! Guess I’m a Texan now, cause that just rolls off the tongue a little too easy 🙂 As some of you know, I’m a meal planning crazy. It comes in handy most of the time, but is also a curse at moments. Like, for instance, when Kev wants to wrap his scrambled eggs in a tortilla for breakfast and I practically fall out of my chair in protest because those were so specifically reserved for quesadillas and enchiladas this week. Or like when I have an itch to get creative in the kitchen, but I literally have no ingredients that aren’t already promised to another dish.\n\nI’m a big fan of getting my meals organized at the beginning of the week because it takes so much stress out of the day to day, but I’m also trying to teach myself about flexibility and adaptability when things don’t go as planned.\n\nThis week when I was trying to plan my meals, my brain froze trying trying to piece all the days together. I was struggling trying to figure out what I was going to make for our small group and how I could tie that in with the blog and the recipes I need to test for my contribution to Pressure Cooking Today, and on top of that figuring out if we have enough for lunch and dinners for the week! It can be a lot, and I know many of you are also having a hard time trying to figure out this whole meal planning thing.\n\nI’ve found that in these busy summer months, it’s most simple to have a rotating schedule of recipes that are my go to’s for the nights at home, and then when we have special occasions or bbq’s to attend, those are the times that I’ll add a fun new recipe into the rotation. That way all I have to figure out for the week is which of my stand by recipes I need to make for dinner and then add any extra ingredients to the shopping list for outside engagements.\n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nThis Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad is one of my favorite recipes to throw together with minimal labor, minimal cost, and it’s something that almost everyone loves! I tend to go simple with pasta salad because why overcomplicate something that’s so good already with only a couple of ingredients?\n\nIn the time it takes the pasta to cook, I can get my dressing whisked together and my veggies chopped and ready, only leaving me to combine the pasta with the rest of the goodies! I love the [balsamic](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9123169-13305110?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthrivemarket.com%2Fp%2Fkitchen-love-balsamic-vinegar-of-modena-premium&cjsku=728119099486) and lemon combination because it adds a zing to the crisp veggies and pairs well with the bright flavor of the fresh parsley.\n\nI prefer my Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad cold, but if you like it slightly warm, you can assemble your veggies and dressing, stir with the warm pasta right out of the pot, and serve immediately!\n\nBon Appetit!\n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-3.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://www.kitschencat.com/lemon-balsamic-summer-pasta-salad/print/6406/)\n\n### Description\n\n_Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad is a light and fresh mix of pasta and your favorite veggies.

    "markdown": "# Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash - Dishing Out Health\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

However, you could also use chicken thighs, but cooking times may vary. When cubing the chicken, try to get them as close in size as possible for even cooking.\n\n**Seasonings:** To season the chicken, you will need paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and pepper.\n\n**[Mayonnaise](https://iamhomesteader.com/homemade-mayonnaise/):** The mayonnaise gives the sauce the creamy texture and richness that bang bang sauce is known for.

If possible, make your own!\n\n**Sriracha:** Sriracha gives the sauce a spicy kick with some heat. You can definitely add more (or use less), depending on how much heat you can handle!\n\n**Honey:** Honey is used to balance out the flavors of the sauce. It adds a natural sweetness that helps to counteract the heat from the Sriracha and balances the tanginess of the Thai sweet chili sauce.\n\n![Raw Bang Bang Chicken Skewers Before Cooking.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-3.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer.

If using wooden skewers, be sure they are soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before using them. Soaking them in water prevents the skewers from charring during cooking. If using metal skewers, make sure they fit in the basket of your air fryer. If using wooden skewers, you can break them in half if you need to shorten them.\n\n![Hand Holding One Bang Bang Chicken Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bangchicken.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer.

You can get the seasoned chicken skewers assembled ahead of time as well as make the bang bang sauce in advance. Once you have the chicken on the skewers, you can store them in the refrigerator or freeze them before cooking. If stored in the refrigerator, they will last 2-3 days, covered. These can also be frozen ahead of time. To freeze, tightly wrap the chicken skewers; they will last in the freezer for up to 3 months. When ready to cook them, let the skewers thaw in the refrigerator overnight. The bang bang sauce can be mixed together and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\n\n![Bang Bang Chicken Skewers on Parchment with a Few Pieces of Chicken not on the Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-6.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer. They make for a delicious appetizer or main course and can also be made in the oven!\")\n\nStoring & Reheating Bang Bang Chicken Skewers\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any leftover chicken skewers, store the skewers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. (If preferred, you can remove the chicken from the skewers when storing.) Reheat them in the oven, microwave, or in a skillet on the stovetop. Store the leftover reserved bang bang sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Brush it over the reheated chicken.\n\n*   ▢ wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes\n\n#### Chicken\n\n*   ▢ 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon black pepper\n\n*   In a large bowl, combine the cubed chicken breasts, oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to evenly coat the chicken.\n    \n*   Working one skewer at a time, thread 4-5 chicken cubes onto each.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce, Sriracha, and honey. Mix well. This will make about 1 ¾ cups bang bang sauce.\n    \n*   Pour half of the sauce into a separate bowl and set aside to use after the chicken has been cooked. Use the rest of the sauce to brush evenly over the chicken.\n    \n*   Add the skewers to the basket of your air fryer in a single layer. (Depending on the size of the air fryer, you may have to work in batches.)\n    \n*   Air fry\\* at 400°F for 11-12 minutes, flipping halfway. Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n    \n*   Transfer the skewers to a plate and drizzle or brush with the reserved bang bang sauce. Serve immediately.\n    \n\n**\\*Oven and Grilling Instructions:**\n\n**Oven:**\n\n1.  Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2.  Place the seasoned cubes of chicken onto the skewers, then onto the lined baking sheet. (Do not brush the chicken with bang bang sauce until after baking in the oven.)\n3.  Cook the chicken skewers for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n4.  Remove from the oven. Brush with the bang bang sauce and serve.\n\n**Grill:**\n\n1.  Thread the seasoned chicken onto the skewers. (Wait until after grilling to brush with the bang bang sauce.) Grill over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes per side, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n2.  Brush the grilled chicken with the bang bang sauce.\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n\nYou can tag me at @iamhomesteader.\n\nWhat the **Test Kitchen** had to say about this recipe:\n\n![](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8710-343x343.jpg)\n\nAutumn\n\nIf you are looking for a simple dish that packs some serious flavor, this one is for you.

The opinions and text are all mine._\n\nDoes the cold weather make you just crave comfort food?  I know it does that to me.  And although I have plenty of room on my meal plan for [warm soups](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/), [cheesy pasta](https://www.foxandbriar.com/one-pot-pasta-bake-sausage-wine/) and all other kinds of comfort food, sometimes I want to keep it healthier and focus on fruits and veggies.  As I shared before with my [Roasted Shrimp, Fennel and Grapefruit Kale Salad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/roasted-shrimp-fennel-and-grapefruit-kale-salad/), I like my cool weather salads to be bulked up with roasted veggies and grains.  Here I have kept the farro and kale, but added roasted delicata squash and pomegranate aerials for that sweet tart zing.  Once again, my local Fred Meyer came through for me by having all the ingredients I needed for this salad, including these gorgeous pomegranates.\n\n[Jump to recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/autumn-harvest-salad-with-pomegranates/#recipe)\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

The bow-tie shape of this pasta works very well with the cubed butternut squash and adds an appealing look to your dinner. Cook bow-tie pasta al dente for best texture.\n*   **Butternut Squash.** This wonderful vegetable is known for its subtly sweet and nutty flavor.

Spinach adds flavor, texture, and colorfulness to this pasta dish.\n\n![ingredients for Creamy Butternut Squash Pasta with Sausage and Spinach in a stainless steel pan](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/butternut-squash-pasta-with-sausage-and-spinach-4.jpg \"Creamy Butternut Squash Pasta with Sausage and Spinach\")\n\n### How to Roast Butternut Squash\n\nFor everything you need to know about roasting this fantastic vegetable, refer to my recipe on [how to roast butternut squash](https://juliasalbum.com/roasted-butternut-squash/).\n\nThe butternut squash should be peeled, seeded, and cubed.  You can do it yourself or buy cubed butternut squash in the store.   _**Tip:** If you peeled, seeded, and cubed butternut squash ahead (or bought cubed squash in the store), you can store it refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.  Use cubed butternut squash within 2 days._\n\n1.  Preheat the oven to 400 F.\n2.  Combine butternut squash with 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.  Toss together.\n3.  Then,  spread the squash on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet in a single layer.   Make sure the butternut squash is not overcrowded.  This way the air can circulate around the squash in the oven and the squash roasts properly instead of steaming. Roasted this way, **without overcrowding**, will give squash a slightly crunchy texture on the outside.  This will ensure that the squash is roasted and not steamed.\n4.  Roast the squash in the preheated oven at 400 F for 30 minutes.\n\n### How To Make Creamy Pasta Sauce\n\nWhile the butternut squash is being roasted, prepare the cream sauce.\n\n1.  In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil together with 4 minced garlic cloves and 6 oz of spinach.  Cook on medium heat for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the spinach starts to wilt.\n2.  Add heavy cream.  Bring to boil and immediately reduce to a low or medium boil.\n3.  Add shredded Parmesan cheese while the sauce simmers, constantly stirring.\n4.  Season with salt to taste, about ¼ teaspoon of salt.  _**Note:** No salt is necessary if the sausage is very salty._\n\n### Cook Sausage\n\nIn a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium heat. Add crumbled sausage and cook for about 10 minutes, regularly stirring, until the sausage is cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.\n\n### How Long to Cook Pasta\n\n*   Usually, the pasta is cooked in a pot of boiling water for 10 minutes. Always check the cooking time on the package instructions for precise times of cooking pasta.\n*   To prepare any pasta **al dente**, cook pasta in boiling water for 8 minutes, or for 2 minutes less than indicated on the package instructions.\n\n### Assemble the Pasta\n\n1.  Add drained cooked pasta and cooked sausage to the creamy spinach sauce in the skillet. Stir. Season with salt and pepper.\n2.  Top with roasted butternut squash.  Stir it in, or leave butternut squash on top.\n\nTips on Making Pasta Ahead\n--------------------------\n\n**Make-ahead Tip:** Roast butternut squash up to 2 days ahead. Keep it refrigerated in an airtight container until ready to use. Reheat it briefly in the microwave (for about 30 seconds) before adding it to the pasta. Or, just add it to the creamy pasta sauce, stir it in and reheat it in the cream sauce.\n\nHow to Store, Freeze, Reheat Roasted Butternut Squash Pasta\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Refrigerate.** Store leftover butternut squash pasta in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n*   **Freeze**. You can freeze butternut squash pasta in an airtight container for up to 2 months.\n*   **Reheat**. Reheat the pasta gently on the stovetop in the skillet over medium heat, stirring halfway through. Add extra milk or heavy cream to thin out the sauce.\n\nIt's always best to serve bow tie pasta (or any pasta) **al dente**. That's when the pasta texture is at its best. Storing cooked pasta for a day or two will cause the pasta to lose its perfect texture, however, it will still taste great.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the cream sauce when refrigerated loses its texture and becomes thick. To reheat it the next day, reheat over medium heat and add extra milk or heavy creamy when reheating to thin out the sauce.\n\n![Creamy Butternut Squash Pasta with Sausage and Spinach on a white plate](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/creamy-butternut-squash-pasta-with-sausage-and-spinach-2.jpg \"Creamy Butternut Squash Pasta with Sausage and Spinach\")\n\nSubstitutions\n-------------\n\n*   **Pasta.**  Use any type of short pasta.  That includes farfalle (bow-tie pasta), penne, rigatoni, fusilli, or orecchiette.  You can also use gnocchi.\n*   **Spinach.**  This butternut squash pasta will work equally well with spinach, kale, Swiss chard, or arugula.  Pick the greens of your choice, add them to the pasta, and enjoy!\n*   **Sausage.**  Use crumbled sausage without casings.  Regular or spicy pork sausage (such as Jimmy Dean brand) is a great choice.    Crumbled Italian sausage or spicy Italian sausage is another excellent option.\n*   **Cheese.**  Use shredded Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, or Asiago.  You can also use shredded low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella cheese.  Do not use soft Mozzarella cheese balls.\n*   **Cream.**  If you don't have heavy cream, you can use half-and-half instead and add more shredded cheese to thicken the sauce.\n\n![Creamy Butternut Squash Pasta with Sausage and Spinach on a white plate (close-up)](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/creamy-butternut-squash-pasta-with-sausage-and-spinach-3.jpg \"Creamy Butternut Squash Pasta with Sausage and Spinach\")\n\nOther Butternut Squash Pasta Recipes\n------------------------------------\n\nButternut squash is an amazing vegetable that pairs beautifully with pasta, whether the squash is roasted or pureed.  Here are some delicious butternut squash pasta recipes to explore:\n\n*   [Butternut Squash Ravioli with Brown Butter and Pecans](https://juliasalbum.com/butternut-squash-ravioli/)\n*   [Butternut Squash and Spinach Tortellini](https://juliasalbum.com/butternut-squash-spinach-tortellini/)\n*   [Butternut Squash and Spinach Lasagna](https://juliasalbum.com/butternut-squash-and-spinach-lasagna/)\n\nWhat to Serve with Butternut Squash Pasta\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*   **Salad.**  Because this pasta has a rich creamy sauce with lots of veggies, any type of simple fresh salad will make an excellent pairing.  Serve this pasta with a [simple spinach salad with pine nuts and Parmesan](https://juliasalbum.com/simple-spinach-salad/) or [cranberry spinach salad with cashews and goat cheese](https://juliasalbum.com/cranberry-spinach-salad-cashews-goat-cheese/).  Or, pair the pasta with the colorful and easy-to-make [arugula salad with apples, cranberries, and pecans](https://juliasalbum.com/arugula-salad-with-apples-cranberries-and-pecans/).\n*   **Bread.**  Serve the pasta with warm garlic bread or olive bread.  If you want to venture out and make your own simple loaf - try this [easy bread recipe made in a bread machine](https://juliasalbum.com/how-to-make-basic-white-bread-less-dense-in-a-bread-machine-recipe/).\n\n![Creamy Butternut Squash Pasta with Spinach and Sausage](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/butternut-squash-pasta-with-spinach-and-sausage-300x300.jpg)\n\nCreamy Roasted Butternut Squash Pasta with Sausage and Spinach is a perfect Autumn comfort food.  This easy and flavorful recipe is packed with veggies and will become your favorite Fall and Winter family weeknight dinner!\n\nPrep Time 30 minutes\n\nCook Time 40 minutes\n\nTotal Time 1 hour 10 minutes\n\nCourse Main Course\n\nCuisine American, Italian\n\nServings 4 people\n\nCalories per serving 759 kcal\n\n#### Sausage\n\n*   1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://www.target.com/p/pure-olive-oil-25-5oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-77600361?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab)\n*   ½ lb sausage , crumbled, without casings\n\n#### Pasta\n\n*   8 oz farfalle (bow tie pasta)\n\n#### Roast Butternut Squash\n\n*   Preheat oven to 400 F.\n    \n*   In a large bowl, toss cubed butternut squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper. \n    \n*   Spread the squash on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet in one layer, without overcrowding. \n    \n*   Roast in the preheated oven at 400 F for 30 minutes.

    "markdown": "# Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower - Recipe Runner\n[Jump to Recipe](#mv-creation-600-jtr)\n\n_Looking for a quick and easy side dish to go with your next meal? Try this parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower! It’s got lots of flavor from the pesto and a nice salty bite from the parmesan cheese. Plus, you only need four ingredients to make it!_\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a plate with a bowl of pesto.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-photos.jpg)\n\n_This recipe and photos have been updated since the original post on 2/22/2017_\n\nThere’s about a 50/50 chance you’ll get a side dish with dinner at our house. If we have company there’s a good chance you’ll get one, but if it’s just me and my husband not so much. \n\nI have been trying to be better about it. My go-to side dish is generally some kind of roasted vegetable, like these [chili honey lime roasted brussels sprouts](https://reciperunner.com/chili-honey-lime-roasted-brussels-sprouts/) or this [sweet and spicy roasted butternut squash](https://reciperunner.com/sweet-spicy-roasted-butternut-squash/).\n\nWhatever side dish I’m making it has to be easy and something that will taste good the next day so I can repurpose it with another meal. This parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower checks both of those boxes and the flavor is next level!\n\n ![ingredients for Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-ingredients-photo.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients For Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Cauliflower\n*   Pesto\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Lemon\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower with a bowl of pesto with a spoon in it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-photographs.jpg)\n\nThis side dish couldn’t be easier to make. Start by preheating your oven to 400° F. Rinse and dry the head of cauliflower and then cut out the core. Break it down into florets and put them on a rimmed sheet pan.\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with any cleanup, line your sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Lay the cauliflower florets onto the sheet pan. \n\nDollop on 3 or 4 tablespoons of pesto depending on how large your head of cauliflower was. Sprinkle with salt and pepper as well. \n\nUse clean hands to toss the cauliflower until all the florets are coated with pesto. Spread them out into a single layer and make sure there is some space in between them. This will allow them to brown and caramelize rather than steam.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-process-photo.jpg)\n\nRoast the pesto cauliflower for 10 minutes and then remove it from the oven. Use a spatula to toss it around and then sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Roast for another another 12-15 minutes or until it’s tender and caramelized.\n\nRemove it from the oven and squeeze the juice of half of a lemon all over it. Put it on a serving platter or in a bowl. I like to scrape up any of the crispy parmesan cheese that’s stuck to the pan and add it in. \n\nDollop on additional pesto and sprinkle on extra parmesan cheese if you’d like. \n\n ![spoon drizzling pesto on top of Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-picture.jpg)\n\n**Tips For Roasting Cauliflower**\n---------------------------------\n\n*   Roast the cauliflower at a high heat. I like to roast mine at 400° F., but you can also roast at 425° F. Just keep an eye on it as it likely won’t take as long to roast.\n*   Slice the cauliflower so that there are plenty of flat edges. Make sure the flat edges are in contact with the bottom of the pan. This will ensure that they get golden brown and caramelized on that side.\n*   Don’t overcrowd the pan. If the cauliflower is too close together or on top of each other it will steam and won’t get any of the crisp edges or caramelization.\n*   Be sure the cauliflower is completely coated in oil or in this case pesto. Pesto contains olive oil which is why I didn’t add any additional oil to this recipe. \n*   Flip the florets over with a spatula halfway through the cooking time. This will help to caramelize more surface area of the florets.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto.

It’s got all the right flavors, textures, and the perfect creamy dressing to finish it all off. \n\nWe enjoy this salad as a side dish, but it can be made into a main course meal by adding in some protein. Grilled and chopped chicken, thinly sliced steak, or even some lentils or quinoa would add plenty of protein and make it filling enough for a full meal. In fact, one of our favorite ways to enjoy Blackberry Salad is with some shredded rotisserie chicken added in.\n\n ![Ingredients being added into a blender jar, processed until smooth, with poppy seeds mixed in, and the final dressing being poured.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad tips\n---------------------\n\n*   When serving Blackberry Salad for a party, event, or holiday meal, I recommend **making the candied pecans and dressing a day or two in advance**. This makes the final assembly a breeze! It’s also a good idea so the pecans have sufficient time to harden and the dressing has a chance to thoroughly chill and for the flavors to intensify.\n*   Use a **good mayonnaise for the dressing–** the better the mayo, the better the dressing will taste. I love Hellman’s/Best Foods® (not sponsored) since it has a rich flavor without being too sweet or tangy.\n*   If you aren’t able to find **fresh or ripe pears** at the store, use whole canned pears and drain them. Thinly slice and use in the salad.\n*   Speaking of ripe pears, you can **test a pear for ripeness** by applying gentle pressure near the stem end. If there is a slight give, it is most likely ready to be sliced and added to the salad. And if you can’t smell any sweet pear-ness, it probably isn’t ready to use.\n*   If you have a fresh lemon on hand, squeeze a bit of **lemon juice on the pear to keep it from browning too quickly**. [Here are a few more tips for preparing the pears](https://usapears.org/pear-ripening-and-handling/).\n\n ![Thin slices of pears and fresh blackberries prepared for a salad, with added feta cheese, leading to the salad's final assembly.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow to use leftover candied pecans\n----------------------------------\n\nSince it’s a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly halve the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nHere are some of our favorite ways to use up leftover pecans from this Blackberry Salad:\n\n*   As a **snack**/**dessert**: Enjoy them plain or coarsely chopped as a topping for a [Yogurt Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/top-10-favorite-ways-top-yogurt-bowl/) or an [Acai Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/acai-bowl/)\n*   **In these sweet** **recipes**: [Carrot Cake](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-carrot-cake/) or [Carrot Cake Cupcakes](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/carrot-cake-cupcakes/)\n*   **In these savory** **recipes**: [Pear Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-pear-pomegranate-salad/), [Butternut Squash Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/butternut-squash-salad/), our favorite [Berry Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/berry-salad-with-a-raspberry-vinaigrette/), or this Fall [Spinach Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spinach-salad/). \n*   **By replacing the regular pecans for candied pecans in these recipes**: [Chicken Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-salad/), [Mexican Wedding Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/mexican-wedding-cookies/), or these [Chocolate Chip Snowball Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chocolate-chip-snowball-cookies/)\n\nYou can store leftover pecans in the freezer (in an airtight container) for up to 2 months. They only need 10-15 minutes at room temperature to thaw enough to eat. (At room temperature, candied pecans last for up to 2 weeks stored in a cool and dry space.)\n\n ![Blackberry salad featuring a drizzle of poppy seed dressing over a mix of blackberries, nuts, greens, and cheese.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad storage\n------------------------\n\nBlackberry Salad doesn’t sit or store well once dressed. Once you assemble it, plan to eat it soon; otherwise, the dressing wilts the lettuce, the pears begin to brown, and the pecans soften.\n\nIf you make Blackberry Salad in advance, store all the components separately. Slice the pear and assemble the salad right before eating.\n\nMore salad recipes\n------------------\n\n*   [Beet and Goat Cheese Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/beet-and-goat-cheese-salad/) _with an orange-honey vinaigrette_\n*   [Olive Garden Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spiralized-cucumber-salad-with-olive-garden-dressing-copycat-video/) _with an Italian vinaigrette_\n*   [Chicken Taco Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-taco-salad/) _with a cilantro-lime vinaigrette_\n*   [Cucumber Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/cucumber-salad/) _with a balsamic vinaigrette_\n*   [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/) _on a spring Cobb salad_\n\n### Salad\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups (5 oz) spring lettuce mix (8 cups is loosely measured)\n*   ▢ 1 package (6 oz.) fresh blackberries\n*   ▢ 2 Anjou pears, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup chopped candied pecans (recipe for a full batch below)\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup crumbled goat or feta cheese\n\n### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup regular (full fat) mayo (I recommend Best Foods/Hellmans)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons EACH: whole milk, heavy cream, white granulated sugar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n*   ▢ pinch of sea salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds\n\n### Candied Pecans (Note 1)\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup white sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n*   ▢ 1 large egg white\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon water\n*   ▢ 1 pound pecan halves\n\n#### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   Combine all of the dressing ingredients, except the poppy seeds, in a blender and process until combined. Taste and adjust any flavors to personal preference. If you'd like a sweeter dressing, add an additional 1-2 teaspoons white sugar. Stir in the poppy seeds. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to serve. (Dressing stays good for 1 week stored in an airtight container in the fridge.)\n    \n\n#### Candied Pecans\n\n*   Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the white sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Stir to combine.\n    \n*   In another bowl, whisk the egg whites, vanilla, and water until frothy. Toss the pecans into this mixture and then remove, using a slotted spoon. Put the nuts into the sugar mixture and toss until well coated. Spread coated pecans onto a baking sheet.\n    \n*   Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are evenly browned. This takes about 45-60 minutes total. Let stand for 30-45 minutes to allow the pecans to fully cool and solidify. Coarsely chop for the salad.\n    \n\n#### For the Salad\n\n*   In a large salad bowl, toss together the spring lettuce mix and fresh (washed and completely dried) blackberries. Thinly slice pears. Add to the salad.\n    \n*   Add the chopped candied pecans, goat or feta cheese, and the dressing. (You may not want all of the dressing on the salad, so add to personal preference.) Toss and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Note 1**: Prep/cook time doesn't include the preparation of the candied pecans.\n\nSince it's a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly half the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nServing: 8servings | Calories: 181kcal | Carbohydrates: 15.7g | Protein: 2.2g | Fat: 13g | Cholesterol: 12.1mg | Sodium: 134.8mg | Fiber: 2.6g | Sugar: 12.4g\n\nWe do our best to provide accurate nutritional analysis for our recipes.

    "markdown": "# 10-Minute Peach & Burrata Salad - Well Seasoned Studio\nIf there’s one dish we have on repeat all summer long, it’s for sure this light, refreshing **peach burrata salad!** Stone fruit season lasts roughly from June till September, so make this as often as you can — even though peaches are available year round in most places, they are **sweetest and juiciest** while in season! **Combine fresh peaches with room temperature burrata cheese** (room temp is key!) **and thinly sliced prosciutto**. This on its own would be heaven, but we’re adding **truffle oil** which makes this a next level peach salad, m’kay!\n\nHere’s why we love this salad so much:\n\n*   Makes for an **easy, light lunch!** It won’t weigh you down, but is so completely satisfying you’ll want to enjoy it every day!\n*   **No cooking required!** We adore a no cook lunch, especially when we’re busy.\n*   **Flavorrrr!** Fresh peaches, creamy burrata cheese, and silky prosciutto — when combined together, well… _swoon!_ Because there are so few ingredients, buy high quality for the best flavor.\n*   **Truffle oil!** Adding a drizzle of truffle oil to the salad is the perfect _je ne sais quoi_ that brings the ingredients together harmoniously. Finish it all off with flaky sea salt and black pepper, and you’ve got one hell of a salad!\n\nBe sure to try our [Grilled Peach Salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-peach-salad/) next or check out all our **[easy salad recipes](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/recipes/salad/).** If you’ve got any leftover peaches, give our [Peach Crumble](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/peach-crumble/) a try for dessert!\n\n![Ingredients for peach burrata truffle salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ingredients-for-peach-burrata-truffle-salad-683x1024.jpeg)\n\nIngredient Notes\n----------------\n\n*   Ripe peaches, _either freestone or clingstone_\n*   Burrata cheese, _room temperature_\n*   Prosciutto (_optional, but highly recommended!_)\n*   [Truffle oil](https://amzn.to/3xtHbcG)\n*   Basil\n*   [Flaky sea salt](https://amzn.to/3gDkoV0)\n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n\nYou can use any type of peach you like best (or just grab whatever is ripe and smells sweetest at the store!). When you’re making a dish with so few ingredients, it’s important to select high quality items. Make sure the peaches aren’t bruised or discolored. Buy fresh, creamy burrata cheese. And if you can get prosciutto from an Italian deli (or even behind the deli counter!), it’ll be 10x better than what comes in a package.\n\n![How to assemble a peach salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/How-to-assemble-a-peach-salad-1024x1020.jpg)\n\nHow To Make An Epic Peach Burrata Salad\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cut the peaches.** If using a **freestone peach**, use a knife to cut all the way around the fruit, ensuring that the knife is touching the pit the entire time. Use your hands to separate the halves from each other, then gently lift away the pit and discard. Cut each peach halve into slices about ½” thick. If using a **clingstone peach**, you’ll cut the peach the same way, but the pit will be more stubborn to remove. Use a [paring knife](https://amzn.to/3q5nQMx) to help separate the pit from the flesh of the peach, then pull the pit out and discard.\n2.  **Arrange the prosciutto.** Rip the prosciutto into small pieces, then arrange nestled in between the peaches.\n3.  **Rip the burrata.** Use your hands to gently tear the burrata into small bite size pieces, being careful to keep a bit of the creamy filling with each bite. Scatter around the plate.\n4.  **Season the salad.** Drizzle the entirely plate lightly with about 1 Tbsp of truffle oil (a little goes a long way), then season the peach slices and burrata with flaky sea salt and black pepper. Garnish with a few fresh basil leaves, then serve immediately.\n\n![Peach and burrata salad with prosciutto on a gray plate with fork.](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Peach-and-burrata-salad-with-prosciutto-on-a-gray-plate-with-fork.jpg)\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n**Freestone vs Clingstone peaches — what’s the difference?**\n\nThis refers to how much the fruit clings to the stone, or pit, of the peach. Freestone peaches have pits that easily life away, while clingstone peaches hold onto the pit more. For a sweet peach that you can eat out of hand, look for a **freestone.** Once exposed, the put will fall away easily. **Clingstone,** however, are sweeter and juicier!\n\n**What is burrata cheese?**\n\nIt’s a soft cow’s milk cheese that looks deceptively like mozzarella. In fact, that’s what the outer layer is! The inside is filled with straciatella and cream, and has a luxurious soft, wet texture. Check out our [braised beef pappardelle](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/braised-beef-pappardelle/), [burrata pizza](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/burrata-pizza/), and [grilled potato salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-potato-salad/), all featuring our favorite cheese: burrata!\n\n**Can I use mozzarella in place of burrata?**\n\nMozzarella won’t have the same creamy texture, but of course you can use it! We recommend tearing a freshly made ball of mozzarella into small bite size pieces. The pre-shredded or packaged cheeses won’t be as good here.\n\n**Truffle oil is expensive. Can I use something else?**\n\nThe truffle oil is really the signature flavor of this dish, so we think it’s worth it. If you don’t like or can’t find truffle oil, replace with a generous drizzle of a high quality finishing oil. [This](https://amzn.to/3iWPOsp) is our favorite!\n\n![Peach salad with basil and prosciutto on a plate](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Peach-salad-with-basil-and-prosciutto-on-a-plate-683x1024.jpg)\n\n**[Don’t forget to pin this for later!](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/24699497946669429/)**\n\nNot sure how many times we need to say this, but _damn,_ is this salad amazing!

Reserve the rest for drizzling on the salads. Add the chicken breasts and marinate the chicken for 20 minutes.

Cook for 6-8 minutes on each side or until chicken is cooked through. Note-discard the dressing that the chicken was in. Let the chicken rest while you prepare the salads.\n*   Divide the greens, blueberries, avocado, almonds, feta, and red onion onto four plates. Slice the grilled chicken and place on top of the salads. Drizzle with remaining lemon poppy seed dressing and serve immediately.\n\nSalad Tips\n----------\n\n*   The lemon poppy seed dressing serves as a dressing and marinade for the chicken. It is easy to whisk up and adds a lot of flavor to the chicken and salad. You can marinate the chicken for 20 minutes or you can prepare it in advance and let it marinate for a few hours in the fridge.\n*   You can grill the chicken on an outside grill or on a grill pan inside.\n*   If you want the salad to be vegetarian, you can leave the chicken off of the salad.

    "markdown": "# Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps. - Half Baked Harvest\nThis post may contain affiliate links, please see our [privacy policy](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/privacy-policy/) for details.\n\nThis Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wrap is the perfect wrap to enjoy for lunch or dinner. Grilled chicken wrapped up with Caesar salad tossed greens, avocado, bacon, and basil pesto. This colorful grilled chicken wrap is simple to make, wholesome, and delicious. Use leftover grilled chicken or make my spicy black pepper chicken on the grill. The wraps are great either way and yummy served warmed or chilled.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-1.jpg)\n\nCan you believe this is basically the first wrap recipe I’ve ever shared? I’ve avoided things like wraps and burritos for the longest time. And for the silliest reason…they’re hard for me to photograph. I know, how dumb, but we all have our hang-ups in life.\n\nBut I’m moving beyond and embracing wraps this summer. They feel new and exciting to me and that’s just what I need. New, fun, and exciting.\n\nI made these the very last day before heading off to LA the other week. I wasn’t planning on being able to get these done in time. But I really wanted to try so that I’d be able to share them ahead of Memorial Day weekend. And I am so glad I did! They’re perfect for using up any leftover chicken or for grilling up on Memorial Day.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-2.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients for the wraps\n\n*   4 large tortillas or gluten free tortillas\n*   grilled chicken or rotisserie chicken\n*   shredded lettuce or spinach\n*   sliced or diced avocado\n*   fresh basil (consider an herb garden on your front steps or side yard for fresh herbs year round)\n*   basil pesto\n*   cooked bacon\n*   crumbled blue cheese or shredded cheddar\n*   (If you want to add more to your wrap, red onion, cucumbers, and tomatoes would be delicious)\n\n### Here are the quick details\n\nThe recipe calls for already cooked chicken. You can use whatever you have on hand. Or make the black pepper chicken I often grill during the warm weather months.\n\nIt’s simply chicken tenders, tossed with olive oil, either cajun seasoning or fajita seasoning, and black pepper. Literally just three ingredients, but this mix is a go-to for me. I gave you the recipe in the notes section, so you can use that, or as I said, use leftover chicken.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-3.jpg)\n\nThe reason I really wanted to make these? I wanted another recipe to use [my homemade tortillas](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/homemade-flour-tortillas/) with. If you guys haven’t made these yet, please make them soon! They are far superior to anything you might find at the store.\n\nVery soft, but with deliciously charred pockets and so much flavor. They’re perfect for this style of wrap because you can really taste the tortillas.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-4.jpg)\n\n### The salad\n\nFor the salad, I made a short-cut Caesar dressing and tossed it with some shredded romaine lettuce, cubed avocado, and fresh basil.\n\nThe dressing is obviously key, it adds creaminess plus flavor to each wrap.\n\nWhen you have the salad tossed, all that’s left is to roll the wraps. As I mentioned, I used my homemade tortillas, then layered on some basil pesto, the Caesar salad, grilled chicken, bacon, and some blue cheese. If you don’t enjoy blue cheese, you can use shredded cheddar or even just crumbled feta.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-5.jpg)\n\nThen, wrap and roll burrito style.\n\nSince I used fresh grilled chicken and warm tortillas off the skillet, I didn’t feel the need to warm my wraps. But if you like, you can cook them in a skillet with a little olive oil until warmed. Or serve them chilled – either way is honestly so delicious.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-6.jpg)\n\nThese would be really nice for your Memorial Day picnics…and any other summer outings to follow.\n\nI know Creighton wishes he had his own wrap will sitting here by the pool!\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-7.jpg)\n\n_Looking for other picnic-style sandwich recipes?

Above all, I love to hear from you guys and always do my best to respond to each and every comment. And of course, if you do make this recipe, don’t forget to tag me on Instagram! Looking through the photos of recipes you all have made is my favorite!\n\n**What does basil pesto consist of?**\n\nTraditional pesto is a blend of fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, extra-virgin olive oil, and Parmesan cheese (you can hold on the cheese for a vegan variety). Use a food processor to easily mix up your pesto! It was traditionally made by mixing the ingredients with a mortar and pestle.\n\n**Is pesto healthy?**\n\nYes! All of the ingredients in pesto have health benefits and the fat source is considered unsaturated.\n\n**Where did pesto originate?**\n\nThe bright green, herby sauce originated in Genoa, Italy.\n\n**How else can I use pesto?**\n\nAdd a dollop of pesto to pasta, spread on sandwich bread, or add to poultry and vegetables. It’s a versatile spread that is delicious when used a number of ways!\n\nPrep Time 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings: 4 wraps\n\nCalories Per Serving: 792 kcal\n\nNutritional information is only an estimate.

Taste and adjust the salt and pepper.\n    \n    2\\. To make the wraps. In a large salad bowl, combine the lettuce, avocado, and basil. Toss with 1/2 of the dressing.\n    \n    3\\. Place one tortilla at a time in the microwave for 20 seconds. Spread on a layer of pesto, then add the salad, chicken, bacon, and cheese. Drizzle over more dressing. Fold the tortilla over the ingredients. Fold sides and ends of tortillas over filling and roll forward. Repeat with remaining ingredients.\n    \n    4\\. Serve room temp or place in a skillet with olive oil to warm. Enjoy with extra dressing and pesto.\n    \n\n_**Grilled Black Pepper Chicken:**_ In a bowl, toss 1 pound of chicken tenders with 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1-2 tablespoons cajun or fajita seasoning, and a good pinch of black pepper. Grill the chicken until lightly charred and cooked through, turning halfway through cooking, about 10 to 12 minutes.\n\n[View Recipe Comments](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pesto-chicken-and-avocado-bacon-salad-wraps/#comments)\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-8.jpg)"

This year, in an attempt to eat better, and stay on top of meals so I don’t feel as much need to snack, or binge on junk, I have started making some meal prep bowls.\n\nOne of the ones I made was this Greek Chicken Meal Prep Bowls from Damn Delicious. It was delicious. I made it a few more times, and changed it slightly by adding a few things to the marinade, etc. But I loved it so I had to share it.\n\n### Look how easy it is:\n\nMy husband works out of town a lot, and so I like to make food for him when I can so he doesn’t have to eat fast food all the time.\n\nSo these meal prep bowls have really come in handy for that as well. As well as these [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) or these [Salsa Verde Taco Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/).\n\n![Greek Chicken Recipe: Insanely delicious Greek Chicken bowl recipes.

You have a [marinade for the chicken](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/the-best-greek-chicken-marinade/ \"The Best Greek Chicken Marinade\"). It is a super simple to make marinade, that offers great flavors in as little as 20 minutes. I loved how flavorful this chicken turned out.\n2.  Then you have the [cucumber salad](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/greek-cucumber-salad-2/ \"Greek Cucumber Salad\"). It is a pretty simple recipe that utilizes fresh cucumbers, lemon, and seasonings. I could eat a big bowl of this by itself.\n3.  Last, there is the [tzatziki](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/tzatziki/ \"Tzatziki\"), which I think just brings the whole dish to life with the fresh flavors, and smooth creaminess.\n\nThe chicken is tender and juicy, the veggies fresh, and the flavors are awesome. I was worried the cucumbers wouldn’t stay crisp, but if you use the English cucumbers, they should be good for the 3-5 days.\n\n![Greek Bowl: Insanely delicious Greek Chicken bowl recipes.

It is so nice to have a lunch ready for me, and not have to try and come up with what I am going to eat.\n\nMy daughter, who is in elementary school, and loves Greek inspired food as well even asked if she could take one of the Greek Chicken Meal Prep Bowls to school for lunch.\n\nAnd the great thing is I could say yes because they taste great cold.\n\n**I like to eat them chilled.**\n\nBut if you want, you can heat the chicken and rice portions up before eating, or cook this fresh, and eat day of, while the chicken is still hot.\n\nYou could also split the salad and chicken and rice into separate containers if you want to reheat!\n\n![Chicken Bowl: Insanely delicious Greek Chicken bowl recipes.

I love these because they are divided into 3 compartments, are washable (dishwasher safe) and reusable, and come in [black](https://amzn.to/2vGSDmo) or [green](https://amzn.to/2vGwkxj), so I can make one with more garlic for me and less garlic for the husband, and we can know which is which.\n*   For additional meal prep, check out this [cookbook featuring 100+ ideas](https://amzn.to/2iRhw6T) or try this recipe for [ITALIAN CHICKEN MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) or [TACO MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   I loved this [meal prep lunch bag](https://amzn.to/2jFBXaY) for keeping things cool and organized.\n*   Meal prep with multiple people and swap to avoid eating the same thing all week.\n*   This meal is best within 3 days, but is good up to 5 days.\n*    This does NOT have to be a meal prep, it also serves as a delicious family dinner option!\n*   Start your brown rice in a [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2iIkrE0), or use something like these [Ready To Serve Rice Bowls](https://amzn.to/2jTaTTC) to speed up meal prep.\n\n### More Meal Prep Ideas\n\nOther Easy Meals you May Enjoy and could work for Meal Prep:\n\n*   [Flank Steak Sheet Pan Fajitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-flank-steak-fajitas/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Garlic Chicken](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-garlic-chicken-veggies/)\n*   [Chicken and Veggie Pitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/10-minute-grilled-chicken-protein-pitas/)\n*   [Taco Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) \n\n![Greek chicken meal prep bowls are easy to make and deliciously healthy.](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/greek-chicken-meal-prep-3-1-320x320.jpg)\n\n#### Greek Chicken\n\n*   2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts\n*   1/4 cup olive oil\n*   3 Tbs garlic minced (Note, adjust to preference)\n*   1/3 cup fresh lemon juice\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1 Tbs dried oregano\n*   1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n#### Cucumber Salad\n\n*   2 English cucumbers peeled and sliced\n*   1/3 cup lemon juice\n*   2 Tbs olive oil\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1/2 Tbs minced garlic\n*   1/2 tsp dried oregano\n\n#### Tzatziki Sauce\n\n*   1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   1 English cucumber finely diced\n*   1 tsp \\- up to 1 Tbs minced garlic adjust to garlic preference\n*   1/2 Tbs dill weed or 1 Tbs fresh dill, chopped fine\n*   1 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tsp lemon zest\n*   1/2 tsp chopped fresh mint optional\n*   Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### The Rest\n\n*   3 cups cooked brown rice\n*   1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes halved\n*   1/2 cup red onion slices\n\n*   In a large plastic zip bag, combine olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, greek yogurts and salt and pepper. Massage to mix.\n    \n*   Add chicken into the bag.\n    \n*   Massage to make sure chicken is full covered and marinate for at least 20 minutes, up to 12 hours.\n    \n*   Drain the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade.\n    \n*   In a skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat.\n    \n*   I used my [Anolon Skillet](http://amzn.to/2vGtydc) which I love because it heats evenly, is metal utensil friendly, and can be used in the oven up to 400 degrees.\n    \n*   Add chicken when it is hot, and cook, flipping part way through. Cook approximately 3-4 minutes per side. Cooking time depends on thickness and size of the chicken. Cook until internal temp is 165 degrees.\n    \n*   Remove from pan, and let cool.\n    \n*   Once cool, cut into bite sized pieces. Just make sure you let it cool, or all the juice will run out.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, make cucumber salad by chunking the cucumbers, and tossing in a bowl with the lemon juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and oregano. Set aside\n    \n*   Make tzatziki sauce by combining the Greek yogurt, cucumber, garlic, dill weed, lemon juice, lemon zest in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. And add mint (optional)\n    \n*   Refrigerate while assembling your bowls.\n    \n*   Cook brown rice according to package directions. When finished cooking, divide between meal prep containers, 1/2 cup in each container, halve cherry tomatoes, and mix with red onion slices. Divide amongst the bowls.\n    \n*   Top with chicken, cucumber salad, and some tzatziki sauce.\n    \n*   Keep for 3- 5 days in airtight container, serve cold!\n    \n\n\\* Adjust garlic to your preference. I love garlic. Cut back if you don't (in marinade and tzatziki sauce)  \nThe marinade should be drained off, you don't want to eat all that garlic, just use it to flavor your chicken.  \n\\*\\* Another great meal prep option are these [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nRecipe adapted from [Damn Delicious](http://damndelicious.net/2016/11/16/greek-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nCalories: 521kcal | Carbohydrates: 40g | Protein: 43g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 97mg | Sodium: 109mg | Potassium: 1246mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 8g | Vitamin A: 725IU | Vitamin C: 44.1mg | Calcium: 126mg | Iron: 3mg\n\nOur recipe card software calculates these nutrition facts based on averages for the above ingredients, different brands, and quality of produce/meats may have different nutritional information, always calculate your own based on the specific products you use in order to achieve accurate macros for this recipe.\n\n![](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thumbnail_App-Icon.png) Try PrePear, my FREE Meal Planning App that allows you to save your recipes, plan meals, shop for groceries, and cook simply in one place.

I am here to tell you that making risotto at home is easy and just as delicious as coming from a famous chef.\n\nButternut Squash Risotto using [Holland House Cooking Wine](https://bit.ly/2DUHUwI) is about to be your new go-to recipe.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-3.jpg)\n\n \n\n**Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme.**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe holiday season has arrived once again. It always seems like it is forever away and then BAM, hits me like a load of bricks.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-FB.jpg)\n\nAt my house we host three major holiday celebrations with different sets of friends and family.

Thankfully, Butternut Squash Risotto happens to be one of those dishes that I could eat for every meal and never grow tired of.\n\nRisotto in general is a dish that many associate with class and elegance. The type of dish you might order at a fancy restaurant, but not make at home. I’m here to give you instructions and the confidence to make risotto at home and totally rock at it!\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Butternut-Squash-Risotto.jpg)\n\nIt really isn’t all that hard if you know the basics. First is the rice, Arborio rice. [Arborio rice](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/ingredient/arborio/) is an Italian short grain rice that is named after the town it hails from, Arborio, in the Po Valley. However, present day, it is grown all over, including in the United States.\n\nThe plump, short body makes it unique in its ability to soak up loads of liquid and release starches that result in the creaminess that so many people associate with risotto.\n\nIn fact, while many risotto recipes do contain cream or cheese, many do not and people are often baffled by the creaminess level.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-7.jpg)\n\nThese unique little pods provide a blank slate for flavor, therefore being mindful of what liquid you add is crucial.\n\nTo give my risotto a rich and robust taste, I use Holland House White Cooking Wine.

To save time, you could use the Sweet Kale Chopped Salad Mix.\n*   **Quinoa or Rice**: use any kind.\n*   **Apples**: Honeycrisp, Pink Lady, and Fuji are my favorites. Or you could use pears or figs.\n*   **Dried cranberries or raisins** add sweetness.\n*   **Nuts and seeds**: pecans, walnuts, or roasted pumpkin seeds add crunch, flavor, and healthy fats.\n*   **Crumbled feta cheese, goat, or blue cheese**\n*   **Apple cider vinaigrette**: a simple yet flavorful dressing made of honey, Dijon mustard, garlic, apple cider vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil\n*   **Protein**: toss in some shredded chicken or chickpeas (optional)\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n*   One butternut squash _peeled, seeded and diced_\n*   ½ tablespoon oil of choice\n*   salt and freshly ground pepper\n*   1/2 cup quinoa or Rice \n*   2 cups chopped kale leaves\n*   Two small apples, pears, or figs sliced or dice\n\n**Toppings:**\n\n*   ¼ cup dried cranberries\n*   ¼ cup pecans roughly chopped\n*   ⅓ cup reduced-fat crumbled feta cheese\n*   2 tbsp nuts or seeds\n\n**For the apple cider vinaigrette:**\n\n*   3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n*   2 tbsp apple cider vinegarette\n*   1 tbsp maple syrup or honey\n*   1.5 tsp Dijon mustard\n*   One garlic clove minced\n\n**Directions**\n\n**Roast the butternut squash.** Toss with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n\n**Cook the quinoa** and let it cool.\n\n**Make dressing.** Put all the ingredients in a jar and shake until combined.\n\n**Massage the kale**.

With diced sweet potatoes, fluffy quinoa, fresh spinach, creamy avocado, and a delightful combination of dried cranberries and slivered almonds, this **Roasted Sweet Potato, Spinach and Quinoa Salad** offers a burst of flavors and textures.\n\n![bowl of roasted sweet potato, spinach & quinoa salad](https://happilyunprocessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/roasted-sweet-potato-spinach-quinoa-salad.jpg)\n\nWHY THIS SALAD WORKS:\n---------------------\n\nDrizzled with a zesty lemon vinaigrette, every bite is a harmonious blend of tanginess and earthiness. The roasted sweet potatoes, cooked quinoa, and vibrant greens create a satisfying base, while the addition of red onion and garlic-infused dressing takes it to the next level. It all gets tossed together and is served immediately for a vibrant and nourishing meal.\n\nHow to Make It:\n---------------\n\n1.  To start, we roast the sweet potatoes until they’re tender and perfectly caramelized.\n2.  Meanwhile, the quinoa cooks in a flavorful chicken or vegetable stock, absorbing all the deliciousness. Once ready, we combine the roasted sweet potatoes, fluffy quinoa, chopped spinach, dried cranberries, sliced red onion, creamy avocado, and crunchy slivered almonds in a large bowl.\n3.  Now, let’s talk about the star of the show – the Lemon Vinaigrette. This zesty dressing brings everything together, adding a tangy and refreshing element to the salad. It combines red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, dried oregano, fresh basil, roasted garlic, organic lemon juice, olive oil, sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Whisking it all together creates a flavorful and emulsified dressing that perfectly complements the salad’s ingredients.\n4.  Remember, this salad is best served immediately to retain its freshness and crunch. The lemon vinaigrette adds a delightful tang, but be mindful not to overdress the salad, as it can cause the greens to wilt.\n\nNourishing Bliss\n----------------\n\nOur Wholesome Sweet Potato Quinoa Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette is not only a feast for the taste buds but also a nutritional powerhouse. Sweet potatoes offer a dose of vitamins and fiber, quinoa provides protein and essential nutrients, and spinach adds a boost of iron and antioxidants. It’s a salad that nourishes both the body and the soul.\n\n[![bowl of roasted sweet potato, spinach & quinoa salad](https://happilyunprocessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Quinoa-Salad-2pic.jpg)](https://happilyunprocessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Quinoa-Salad-2pic.jpg)\n\nNot only does this delicious satisfy your taste buds with its vibrant and refreshing flavors, but it also nourishes your body and uplifts your soul.

Thank you for your support.\n\n> This quinoa spinach salad is loaded with fall favorites like butternut squash, chopped apples and quinoa. It is packed with nutrition and flavor and you’ll love the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing!\n\nI typically go crazy with pumpkin recipes as soon as fall hits, but today I have a pumpkin-less recipe that features more fall produce favorites – butternut squash, apples and greens. I’ve been eating these things separately or in other dishes, but finally decided to throw them all together for a tasty meal-sized salad.\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples. A fork of on the plate and a dish towel to the side.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fall-harvest-salad-updated.jpg)\n\nHearty fall salads are seriously the best! In this Quinoa Spinach Salad, the [roasted butternut squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/web-stories/how-to-make-roasted-butternut-squash/) makes it sweet and satisfying, while the apple and pepitas add a nice crunch. Quinoa adds some staying power and the spinach nourishes the body in a way that no other food (besides other leafy greens) can. If you like my [garlicky kale salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/garlicky-kale/), you’ll love this one because the dressing is almost exactly the same – I just added a little maple syrup to sweeten it up a bit. And if you enjoy this salad, you should also check out my full roundup of [quinoa salad recipes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/easy-quinoa-salad/).\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad.jpg)\n\nHealth Benefits of Quinoa\n-------------------------\n\nI love using quinoa as a base for salads. It’s naturally gluten-free, high in protein and one of few plant foods that contain all nine essential amino acids ([source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-quinoa)). Not only that, but it’s also high in fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin E and various beneficial antioxidants! Talk about a powerhouse ingredient!\n\nUnfamiliar with making quinoa? I’ve got a great guide on [how to cook quinoa](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/) and it’s loaded with information about this little seed too.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being fully mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-2.jpg)\n\nHere’s What You Need\n--------------------\n\n*   **baby spinach** and **quinoa** – the base of this [meal-sized salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-build-a-healthy-salad/). You’ll need 1 1/2 cups of cooked quinoa which is 1/2 cup dry quinoa.\n*   **butternut squash** – cut the squash into uniform, bite-size pieces so they roast evenly.\n*   **apple** –  I prefer to use Honeycrisp, Pink Lady or Fuji apples, but any variety will work. Uniform, bite sized pieces are ideal here too so you can get a bite with all the flavors together!\n*   **pepitas** – pepitas are pumpkin seeds without the shell, but if you can’t find them you can use regular pumpkin seeds or even pecans for a nice added crunch. Roast them alongside the butternut squash for a roasted flavor boost.\n*   **dried cranberries** – I love adding dried fruit to my salads for a little touch of sweetness and texture. Raisins would also be great in this recipe.\n*   **tahini apple cider vinegar dressing** – tahini, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, tamari, nutritional yeast, garlic and a touch of maple syrup make up this delicious salad dressing.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest salad in a glass bowl being tossed with the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-3.jpg)\n\nSteps to Build This Salad\n-------------------------\n\n**Prep butternut squash** – Prepare the squash by peeling it, cutting it in half and scraping out the seeds, then cut the squash into bite-size cubes. You can also buy pre-cut butternut squash to skip this step! Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and roast at 400°F for 30-40 minutes, turning once or twice, until all the pieces are tender and have a few small brown spots.\n\n**Roast pepitas** – If your pepitas or pecans are raw, you can toast them in the oven with the roasting squash. Spread seeds/nuts on a separate baking sheet and add to the oven with the butternut squash for 5 to 10 minutes or until the seeds/nuts are golden and crunchy, then remove from the pan to cool. Be sure to watch the seeds/nuts carefully because they can burn quickly. The pepitas will take less time to toast than the pecans because they’re smaller.\n\n**Assemble salad** – While roasting the squash, toss together spinach, cooked quinoa, apple and cranberries in a large salad bowl. Add cooled pepitas (or pecans) once they’ve been toasted. Once the butternut squash is done roasting, allow it to cool and then place into the salad bowl with the other ingredients.\n\n**Make dressing** – While while butternut squash is roasting, prepare the dressing by placing all remaining ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n**Serve** – Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.\n\n![Tossed fall harvest spinach salad in a glass bowl with wooden spoons.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nSwitch it up!\n-------------\n\nYou can easily swap some of the ingredients in this salad and get an entirely different meal that will be equally delicious!\n\n*   **Baby spinach** – use another dark, leafy green like kale or collard greens. Arugula is a great salad base as well.\n*   **Butternut squash** – try [roasted sweet potatoes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/coconut-oil-roasted-sweet-potatoes/) instead, or even [cinnamon maple roasted Kabocha Squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-roasted-kabocha-squash/).\n*   **Apple** – instead of apple, you could use pears or even [jicama](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/jicama-nutrition-benefits).\n*   **Pepitas** – as mentioned above, you can also use pumpkin seeds or pecans. The idea here is to add some crunch so any kind of nut or seed will do!\n*   **Dried cranberries** – raisins or dried cherries would also be tasty!\n\nHow to Serve Fall Quinoa Spinach Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nFor me, this is a meal-sized salad I would eat on its own.

Spread seeds/nuts on a separate baking sheet and add to the oven with the butternut squash for 5 to 10 minutes or until the seeds/nuts are golden and crunchy, then remove from the pan to cool. Be sure to watch the seeds/nuts carefully because they can burn quickly. The pepitas will take less time to toast than the pecans because they’re smaller.\n    \n*   While roasting the squash, toss together spinach, cooked quinoa, apple and cranberries in a large salad bowl. Add cooled pepitas (or pecans) once they’ve been toasted.\n    \n*   Prepare dressing by placing all remaining ingredients (tahini through maple syrup) in a blender and blend until smooth.\n    \n*   Once the butternut squash is done roasting, allow it to cool and then place into the salad bowl with the other ingredients. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.\n    \n\n**Baby spinach** – use another dark, leafy green like kale or collard greens. Arugula is a great salad base as well.\n\n**Butternut squash** – try [roasted sweet potatoes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/coconut-oil-roasted-sweet-potatoes/) instead, or even [cinnamon maple roasted Kabocha Squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-roasted-kabocha-squash/).\n\n**Apple** – instead of apple, you could use pears or even [jicama](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/jicama-nutrition-benefits).\n\n**Pepitas** – as mentioned above, you can also use pumpkin seeds or pecans. The idea here is to add some crunch so any kind of nut or seed will do!\n\n**Dried cranberries** – raisins or dried cherries would also be tasty!\n\nServing: 1/2 of recipe | Calories: 561kcal | Carbohydrates: 73g | Protein: 23g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 3g | Sodium: 641mg | Fiber: 15g\n\nNutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.\n\nHey there, I’m Brittany, the creator of Eating Bird Food, [cookbook author](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/cookbook/), health coach and mama of two littles.

But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like.

This chicken tastes just like what you would find at Chipotle restaurant!_\n\nMy whole family loves to eat at Chipotle restaurant, so I’ve started making some of these dishes at home. We adore their famous [Chipotle carnitas](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/chipotle-carnitas/), [Chipotle barbacoa](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/chipotle-barbacoa/), [cilantro lime rice](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/cilantro-lime-rice/), [Chipotle guacamole](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/chipotle-guacamole-recipe/), and this smoky and savory chicken.\n\n![Chopped Chipotle chicken on a plate served with salsas.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-4.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make. A great way to get that restaurant flavor in the comfort of your own home!\")\n\nWhat is chipotle chicken made of?\n---------------------------------\n\nChipotle uses a marinade to flavor its chicken. The marinade is made from the following ingredients:\n\n*   Onion: While this recipe is often made with white onion, I like to use red onion because it has a milder, sweeter flavor.\n*   Ancho Chile: This is a mild type of dried chile that is typically used in Mexican cuisine. You can either buy whole dried chilies and soak them until they get soft, or else use ancho powder. I’m using ancho chile powder here because it’s easier to locate in most grocery stores.\n*   Garlic: Use freshly chopped garlic for the best flavor.\n*   Adobo Sauce: Chipotle chiles are sold in cans of adobo sauce. This ingredient can be found in the international foods aisle of most grocery stores. The sauce has an intensely smoky flavor, but is not overly spicy. If you prefer that your chicken have some spice to it, you can also mince 1-2 chipotle peppers and add them to the marinade.\n*   Oil: The Chipotle restaurant uses rice bran oil, which is a neutral flavored oil. I have found that it’s not easy to locate this oil at the store, so I use olive oil, or another neutral flavored oil.\n*   Herbs and Spices: This marinade also includes traditional Mexican seasonings such as cumin and oregano for added flavor.\n\n![Chicken thighs with bowls of spices, olive oil, onion and garlic.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-1.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make. A great way to get that restaurant flavor in the comfort of your own home!\")\n\nHow do you make chipotle chicken?\n---------------------------------\n\nStart by placing all of the marinade ingredients in a blender, then process until a mostly smooth liquid forms. Pour the marinade into a large bowl or a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs to the marinade, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Remove the chicken from the marinade, then cook it using your preferred method. Let the chicken rest, then cut it into slices or chunks and serve.\n\n![A bowl of chicken in a marinade.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-2.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make. A great way to get that restaurant flavor in the comfort of your own home!\")\n\nTips for the perfect dish\n-------------------------\n\n*   I really prefer to use chicken thighs because they are more flavorful than chicken breasts and also less likely to dry out. That being said, if you prefer white meat, chicken breasts will also work.\n*   You can let the chicken sit in the marinade for up to 12 hours. Any longer than that and the texture of the chicken may start to change.\n*   I typically grill my Chipotle chicken, either outside on a grill or indoors on a grill pan. When the weather is cool and I don’t feel like grilling, I bake the chicken in the oven.\n*   Leftover chicken will stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze any extra cooked chicken for up to 2 months.\n\n![Chicken thighs cooked on a grill pan.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-3.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make.

    "markdown": "# Best EVER Spinach Orzo Salad - Barefeet In The Kitchen\nThis Spinach Orzo Salad is filled with cranberries, creamy goat cheese, tender pasta, and plenty of fresh spinach tossed in a tangy sweet dressing. The salad can be served immediately or kept in the refrigerator for 2-3 days – making this an awesome make-ahead meal for lunch or dinner.\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese in mixing bowl](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-6-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n#### Spinach Salad with Cranberries\n\nThe recipe was inspired by the Cranberry Orzo Salad that Princess Cruises serves in their International Cafe. It’s just so good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh, and delicious.\n\nI’ve included more cruise details at the bottom of the post here for anyone who is interested. As soon as I got home from [our cruise through the British Isles](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/monets-garden/), I immediately recreated the salad for my family.\n\nAs always, I loved the salad, but my guys? The kids decided that the fresh cranberries were too tart. (Crazy kids!)\n\nSo, the next time I made the salad, I went with dried cranberries and it was a win across the board. I like this salad every bit as much with dried cranberries as I do with fresh cranberries – and that’s an even bigger win, since fresh cranberries aren’t available more than a few weeks a year.\n\n(And unless you’re lucky enough to have [cranberries stashed in the freezer for this cake](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/cranberry-christmas-cake/), you’ll be stuck waiting until the holidays to try this awesome salad.)\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese - close up photo](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-2-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\nI took our salad to the next level by adding a generous portion of fresh baby spinach and warm chicken. Both the chicken and the spinach made it a heartier meal for my family.\n\nAnd as far as my guys are concerned, when I include meat that immediately elevates a pasta salad from side dish to main dish status.\n\nFor what it’s worth though, the chicken in this salad really is optional, the salad is delicious without it. I might even prefer it that way myself.\n\n![spinach salad with orzo, cranberries, and goat cheese](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-3-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\n### Spinach Orzo Salad Recipe\n\n_You’ll need the following ingredients to make this:_\n\n*   olive oil\n*   orzo pasta\n*   baby spinach\n*   sliced almonds\n*   dried cranberries\n*   crumbled goat cheese\n*   chicken, optional\n\n**Dressing Ingredients**\n\n*   olive oil\n*   white balsamic vinegar\n*   honey\n*   salt and pepper\n\n_I’ve used both plain goat cheese and a honey goat cheese for this pasta and they’re both delicious._\n\n_However, I really loved the added flavor from the hint of honey in the specialty goat cheese. If you can find it at your store, give it a try!_\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with almonds and cranberries](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-4-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n### Orzo Spinach Salad\n\nTo make this salad, you’ll begin by toasting the orzo over medium heat, about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add 4 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer, and cover with a lid for 7-8 minutes. Drain any liquid, fluff with fork.\n\nPlace the spinach in a large mixing bowl.

After hearing about it so much, the next time it was available, I had to try it.\n\nIt was so very good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh. and delicious.\n\nThe [International Cafe](https://www.princess.com/ships-and-experience/ships/products/dining-included/international-cafe.html) is part of the all-inclusive dining options onboard each cruise ship. The cafe is open 24 hours a day and it’s one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat each time we cruise.\n\nThe morning selections include pastries and fresh croissants, breakfast sandwiches, quiche, fresh fruit, yogurt parfaits, and more. Later in the day, you’ll find a selection of small-bite meals and other sweet and savory treats.\n\nThe selections change daily, so when you find your favorite food there, you’ll want to make the most of it.\n\nAsk me how I know this? <_cough> Nutella donuts <cough>_ I cruised 3x before I managed to snag a much-talked-about Nutella donut and it didn’t disappoint. I’ve learned now to check the selections daily.\n\nEdited to add: I cruised the Caribbean with my sister Jenny a couple of years ago and as soon as we were on the ship for our last cruise (literally, as soon as we embarked), she and I stopped by the International Cafe and picked up some of the pasta salad, along with a sandwich, and a couple of coffees to take to our room and snack on as we were getting unpacked and settled.\n\nI’m happy to tell you that Princess’s Cranberry Orzo Salad was every bit as delicious as I remembered. And fortunately, now we can all enjoy it at home too.\n\nWant to check out more of our [Medallion Class cruise](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/ocean-medallion/) through the Caribbean?

    "markdown": "# Lemon Arugula Salad with Couscous and Feta\n**Our arugula salad, made with an easy lemon vinaigrette, pearl couscous, cucumbers, and feta**, is crave-worthy. Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again.\n\nWatch the Video\n---------------\n\n![Arugula Salad with Couscous Recipe Video](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Arugula-Salad-with-Couscous-Recipe-Video.jpg)\n\n**Related:** We love adding couscous to salads, here’s our [lemon and herb couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12689/lemon-and-herb-couscous-salad-recipe/) with tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\nOur Favorite Arugula Salad\n--------------------------\n\nIt’s funny how certain recipes sneak their way into your weekly rotation. This arugula and couscous salad has done just that. We make it for dinner, eat the leftovers for lunch, and have served it to friends more times than I can count.\n\nYou’ll be itching to make it again once you try this arugula salad recipe. The salad is **simple, fast, and tastes like it came from a fancy restaurant**. Here’s the rundown on how to make it:\n\n![Lemon Arugula and Couscous Salad with Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1-1200.jpg)\n\n**The base of our salad is couscous** — we particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous). It cooks quickly and **gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself**. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, barley, or other grains — farro is excellent in salads (see our [apple, arugula, and farro salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/43230/farro-salad-with-apples/) for inspiration).\n\nAdd crisp **cucumbers**, baby **arugula** (or other tender greens), and **feta** cheese to the couscous. The lemon vinaigrette is simple — just lemon juice, olive oil, and a little honey.\n\n**Tip:** Since the dressing is so simple, it’s easy to play with. If we have it on hand, we love throwing a tablespoon of minced preserved lemon to the party. You can buy it or make your own — we shared this [recipe for preserved lemon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/5543/olives-with-lemon-confit-and-chili-flakes/) a while back if you want to take a look.\n\n![Adding lemon vinaigrette to couscous for the arugula and couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arugula-Salad-Recipe-3-1200.jpg)\n\n**The real trick to this salad is assembling it:** toss most of the dressing with the warm couscous and let it cool slightly before adding other ingredients. We take the same approach when making potato salad (we toss warm potatoes with the dressing first). By doing this, the warm ingredient has a chance to absorb all the flavor in the dressing. A game changer.\n\nThe same idea applies if you swap the couscous for pasta or another grain. Toss the still-warm pasta/grain with the dressing first, let it absorb, and cool slightly. Then, move on to adding the rest of the ingredients.\n\n**This arugula salad would go really well next to** this [Seriously Good Turkey Burger](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/34790/seriously-good-turkey-burger/), our [Easy Lemon Garlic Baked Chicken Breasts](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28703/lemon-garlic-baked-chicken-breast-recipe/) and our [Perfectly Baked Salmon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/149/moms-oven-poached-salmon/) (inspired by my Mom).\n\n![Lemon Arugula Salad with Couscous, Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1200.jpg)\n\n**For more arugula recipes**, take a look at our [Fried Goat Cheese, Strawberry and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/648/fried-goat-cheese-arugula-salad/), our [Lemony White Bean and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/42176/white-bean-salad/), this lovely [Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad Recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12907/shaved-fennel-and-arugula-salad-recipe/) and these [Baked Chicken Thighs with Potatoes, Garlic and Arugula](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28824/baked-chicken-thighs-with-potatoes/).\n\nLemon Arugula Salad with Couscous and Feta\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   PREP 10mins\n*   COOK 10mins\n*   TOTAL 20mins\n\nOur arugula salad, made with an easy lemon vinaigrette, pearl couscous, cucumbers, and feta, is crave-worthy. Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again. We particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous) for this arugula salad. It cooks quickly and gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, or other cooked grains like barley or wheat berries.\n\nMakes 4 large servings\n\nWatch Us Make the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nYou Will Need\n-------------\n\nFor the Salad\n\n1 ½ cups dried pearl (Israeli) couscous, _about 3 cups cooked_\n\n3 ounces baby arugula or tender salad greens, _about 4 cups_\n\nHalf of a hothouse (seedless) cucumber, chopped\n\n2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled, _about 1/2 cup_\n\nFor the Dressing\n\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, _about 1/2 large lemon_\n\n4 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup\n\n1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon, _optional_\n\n1 teaspoon dried basil or a handful chopped fresh basil leaves, _optional_\n\nSea salt and fresh ground black pepper\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n1Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add couscous and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, then add to a large bowl.\n\n2Meanwhile, make the lemon vinaigrette. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, honey, preserved lemon, and basil until it looks thick and blended. Season to taste with salt and fresh ground black pepper (we add a generous pinch of each).\n\n3Toss the cooked and drained couscous with the dressing, then set aside for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly. Finish the salad by adding the arugula, cucumbers, and feta. Toss well, then serve.\n\nAdam and Joanne's Tips\n----------------------\n\n*   The salad will keep overnight in the fridge. As it sits, the greens may wilt slightly, but still will taste great.\n*   If you cannot find pearl (Israeli) couscous, substitute with a regular couscous, small pasta shape such as orzo or cooked grains like quinoa, wheat berries and barley.\n*   Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates. We have used the USDA database to calculate approximate values.

It’s very easy and straightforward, and I also share tips and tricks on how to prevent them sticking to the grill.\n\n1.  **Preheat grill to medium-high heat:** Preheating is VERY important. If the grill grates are hot, the peaches will start developing grill marks immediately, which minimizes sticking. Oil the grates.\n2.  **Cut the peaches**, either into quarters or halves (remove the pit). **Brush** the flat side of the peaches, as well as the grill grates, with olive oil.\n3.  **Grill** cut-side down for 2 to 3 minutes UNDISTURBED per side. Removing them from the grill too early will cause them to stick.\n\n**How to Prevent Peaches from Sticking to Grill**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Find peaches that are ripe but also firm.** They need to be firm so they don’t get mushy, but also ripe for sweetness.\n*   **Size matters.** Bigger pieces of fruit work better. I’d recommend peach halves or quarters.\n*   Make sure the grill grates are **clean**.\n*   **Use medium-high heat.** This minimizes sticking to the grill. Brush the grill grates and peaches with **olive oil**.\n*   **Let them grill undisturbed** to get more defined grill marks. Check after 2-3 minutes and flip when ready.\n*   **Use a thin spatula:** It’s best to use a thin spatula to lift the peaches from underneath. Using tongs to flip peaches on the grill can sometimes rip the grill marks apart.\n*   **Outdoor grill, stovetop grill pan, or indoor electric grill:** I prefer cast iron, but if you’re worried about the fruit sticking to the grill, you can use a nonstick.\n\n![grilled peaches on mixed greens, berries, feta, and candied pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad2-min.jpg)\n\n**Ingredient Notes**\n--------------------\n\nGrilled peach salad is made with lots of great seasonal summer ingredients! Below I share a few ingredient notes from recipe testing. As always, the full ingredient quantity list can be found in the recipe card down below.\n\n**For the salad:**\n\n*   **Fresh peaches:** They should be ripe but firm. They need to be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but also relatively firm so that they don’t fall apart on the grill. The larger the peaches, the better.\n*   **Olive oil:** Brushing the peaches with olive oil helps prevent sticking.\n*   **Berries:** Use any fresh berries of your choice. Blackberries are my favorite for this recipe.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Choose a variety of mixed greens such as baby spinach, arugula, and romaine lettuce for texture.\n*   **Feta crumbles:** Adds fresh savory flavors. Other great choices are goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, and burrata cheese.\n\n**For the balsamic dressing:**\n\n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** For acidity and flavor.\n*   **Olive oil:** Use good extra virgin olive oil for better taste.\n*   **Minced garlic:** For flavor.\n*   **Honey:** To add sweetness and balance out the acidity.\n*   **Dijon mustard:** To help the vinegar and oil emulsify.\n*   **Salt and pepper** to taste\n\n![ingredients including water, salt, brown sugar, pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-balsamic-dressing-labeled.jpg)\n\n**For the Candied pecans:**\n\n**Brown sugar:** For sweetness. I use light brown sugar.  \n**Water:** To help the brown sugar melt and to thin it out.  \n**Pecan halves:** You can also use walnuts, if you prefer.  \n**A pinch of salt:** helps balance out the sweetness.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions**\n-----------------------------\n\nThis grilled peach salad takes about 20 minutes to make. Here’s a tutorial so you can see how easy it is!\n\n### **Step 1 | Make the candied pecans**\n\nIn a small skillet, melt the brown sugar with the water over medium-low heat. Add the pecan halves plus a pinch of salt. Stir to coat for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Want to spice them up? Add a little bit of ground cinnamon or cayenne pepper.\n\n![candied pecans in a small non-stick skillet](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/candied-pecans-for-salad-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 2 | Make the balsamic dressing**\n\nIn a mason jar, combine all the balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar and shake vigorously until emulsified or evenly combined.\n\n![prepared balsamic dressing in a mason jar](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/homemade-balsamic-peach-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 3 | Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n[Cut the peaches](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/) into thick wedges or halves, making sure they are about the same size (remove the pit).\n\nGet your grill preheated to medium-high. Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Brush the peaches with olive oil to prevent them from sticking. Grill the peaches on each flat side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed, or until they develop grill marks. Using a thin spatula, flip and grill the other side for another 2-3 minutes.\n\n### **Step 4 | Assemble the peach salad**\n\nArrange a bed of mixed greens on a large platter. Top with the berries, the prepared candied pecans, crumbled feta, and grilled peaches. Drizzle the assembled grilled peach salad with the prepared balsamic dressing…and ENJOY!\n\n**Prep Ahead Tips**\n-------------------\n\nI wouldn’t recommend making the entire peach salad in advance, but you can certainly prep a few components ahead. If you do this, you can make the entire salad in less than 20 minutes!\n\n*   **Make the candied pecans the day before** and let them cool on the counter overnight. Keep them in a container or in a covered bowl.\n*   **Make the balsamic dressing** up to 2 days in advance and refrigerate. Before using, let it sit at room temp and shake it vigorously again before using.\n*   **Note:** I wouldn’t recommend cutting the peaches until ready to grill. They will release lots of juices, and turn soft and brown overnight.\n\n**Substitutions and Variations**\n--------------------------------\n\nHere are my favorite substitutions for my grilled peach salad:\n\n*   **Greens:** I use a simple blend of mixed greens. You can also use baby spinach, arugula, or your favorite lettuce. For some crunch, use romaine or little gem lettuce.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts work great too! Also try toasted pine nuts, pistachios, or almonds.\n*   **Peaches:** If you can’t find peaches, nectarines are a great substitute.\n*   **Berries:** Mix and match! Try blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Cheese**: Try goat cheese, gorgonzola, blue cheese, mozzarella, or burrata.\n*   **Dressing:** For a creamier texture, try my [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://cookingformysoul.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/). Other great dressings are raspberry vinaigrette and basil vinaigrette.\n*   **Other favorite add-ins:** Avocado, fresh grilled corn, prosciutto, pickled red onions.\n\n![grilled peaches with berries, mixed greens, pecans, and feta](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad4-min.jpg)\n\n**Pairings and Serving Ideas**\n------------------------------\n\nServe this grilled peach salad with [grilled chicken breast](https://cookingformysoul.com/easy-lemon-chicken-marinade/) to make it a whole meal! You can also [cook chicken breast on the stovetop](https://cookingformysoul.com/moist-juicy-seared-chicken-breasts/).\n\nGreat main dish recipes that would pair great with it:\n\n*   [Hawaiian Huli Huli Chicken](https://cookingformysoul.com/huli-huli-chicken/)\n*   [Spatchcock BBQ Chicken](https://cookingformysoul.com/spatchcock-bbq-chicken/) (Grilled or Roasted)\n*   [Marinated Beef Kabobs](https://cookingformysoul.com/marinated-steak-kabobs/)\n*   [Salmon Burgers with Garlic Herb Sauce](https://cookingformysoul.com/salmon-burgers/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken Kabobs](https://cookingformysoul.com/greek-chicken-kabobs/)\n\n**Other summer-inspired recipes you must try!**\n\n*   [\n    \n    Watermelon Feta Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/watermelon-feta-salad-blueberries/)\n*   [\n    \n    Tomato Basil Pasta\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/tomato-basil-pasta/)\n*   [\n    \n    Strawberry Chicken Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/strawberry-and-spinach-salad-with-herbed-chicken/)\n*   [\n    \n    Salmon Cobb Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/salmon-cobb-salad/)\n\n**Recipe FAQs**\n---------------\n\n**Should the peaches be ripe?**\n\nYes, they should be ripe for sweetness, but also relatively firm so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n\n**Can I use canned or frozen peaches?**\n\nPreferably not.\n\n**Can I use nectarines or apricots?**\n\nYou can use nectarines as a substitute for sure. Apricots may be a bit too small to grill properly, but you can.\n\n**Do you peel the peaches?**\n\nI personally prefer to keep the skin on, but you can peel them off if desired. I provide instructions in my [peach prep tutorial](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/).\n\n**How can I prevent the peaches from sticking to the grill?**\n\nMake sure the grill is HOT, brush the sliced peaches with oil, let them cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes before flipping, and use a thin spatula to lift and release the peaches from underneath the grill. Try not to use tongs.\n\n**Can I make this salad ahead?**\n\nGrilled peaches don’t store well, so I’d say no. However, you can make the balsamic dressing and the candied pecans in advance.\n\n**Tips for Success**\n--------------------\n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for sweetness but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **Don’t overcook** the peaches on the grill to prevent them from becoming mushy.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:** 1) Make sure the grill is HOT, 2) brush peaches with oil, and 3) let them grill undisturbed. 4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath. This will help maintain the grill marks on the peaches.\n\nI’d love to hear from you! If you loved my recipe, please consider leaving a 5-star rating and a comment down below.

These black beans give you a little change up and introduce a little sweet and spice thanks to the ginger.\n*   The dressing that goes along with it helps add to the simple flavors of the sautéed black beans and shallots.\n*   This bowl also happens to be **vegan, gluten-free and nut free!** It’s also pretty easy to customize to preference.\n*   **Takes less than 30 minutes to make** and is **super easy to through together** for a quick meal.\n\n**Key Ingredients**\n-------------------\n\n*   **Ginger:** We use both fresh and dried for this recipe\n*   **Garlic:** Also, both fresh and dried\n*   **Black Beans:** Canned to make this come together quickly\n*   **Soy Sauce:** For some simple umami flavors\n*   **Lime:** A bright burst of citrus flavor to complement the ginger and sriracha\n*   **Tahini:** For the creamy factor of the dressing\n*   **Sriracha:** Get a little nice spicy element to the dish\n\n**How to make this nourish bowl**\n---------------------------------\n\nStart by prepping your beans. Rinse and drain your beans really well and set aside. In a pan, start by sautéing your shallots with a little oil until mostly softened. Then add in your garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant.\n\n*   ![Pan with sauced shallots and black beans.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_1.jpg)\n    \n*   ![black beans being stirred together with spinach.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_2.jpg)\n    \n\nThrow in your beans and continue to sauté to help incorporate more of the garlic and ginger flavors with the beans. Add in spinach and a little soy sauce and allow spinach to wilt.\n\n*   ![Ginger sriracha sauce being mixed together in a jar.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_3.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Bowl of ginger black beans with rice and sliced cucumber topped with ginger sriracha sauce and cilantro.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_4.jpg)\n    \n\nPrepare the sauce by mixing all of the dressing ingredients together. Adjust consistency by adding small amounts of water at a time until desired consistency is achieved.\n\n**Tips for making the perfect bowl**\n------------------------------------\n\n*   Canned beans make this dish come together really fast. It’s important to make sure you rinse your beans really well to remove the sauce that coats them. Not only will it make it easier to sauté the beans with your shallots and ginger, but it will also remove excess starches that are responsible for excess gas in your guts.\n*   Make sure you use a good quality tahini for your dressing. Good quality tahini should not taste bitter. It should be mild and smooth, so that it has an easier time highlighting the main flavors without taking away from them. My preferred brand is by Soom Foods.\n\n**How long will the dressing keep for?**\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe dressing can be stored in an airtight container or jar for up to 4 days. Before using after refrigeration, give it a good stir and adjust consistency with additional water if needed. Make sure to use very little additional water as the dressing will loosen up a little bit more as it comes to room temperature.\n\n**What to pair with your beans in your nourish bowl**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe beans and sauce go really well with rice or quinoa. You can also add in some baked tofu for more protein if desired. Cooling vegetables like cucumber go really well with this bowl as well. Top with some fresh herbs like cilantro and some avocado on the side make for an extra enjoyable bowl.\n\n**More Nourish Bowls to Try**\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Almond Miso Chickpea Nourish Bowl](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/02/almond-miso-chickpea-nourish-bowl/)\n*   [Edamame Crunch Salad](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/03/edamame-crunch-salad-with-sesame-cashew-lime-dressing/)\n*   [Tahini Ranch Tofu Sheet Pan](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/01/tahini-ranch-tofu-sheet-pan/)\n\n![Side of the black bean nourish bowl with a spoon tucked into it.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_5.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/04/black-bean-nourish-bowl/print/4059/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\nThis Black Bean Nourish Bowl gives you a new and fun way to flavor your black beans by using a creamy ginger and sriracha infused dressing.

Make it once and your family will request it again and again!_\n\n![Overhead closeup view of a white bowl filled with brown rice and topped with basil chicken in coconut curry sauce with extra fresh basil on top and recipe title at top of image](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-New-Lead-683x1024.jpg)\n\n_(This recipe for Basil Chicken in Coconut Curry Sauce was originally published in February 2010, but was updated with new photos in 2019)._\n\nSometimes I spend more time trying to decide what to make for dinner than I do actually making dinner. But when I just can't decide what to make, I usually head over to my favorite blogs and just browse.\n\nYou all know I'm obsessed with Martha Stewart and everything she does, but her website is not easy to navigate for inspiration.\n\nMost blogs are much easier to browse and find yummy dishes to make. One of my favorite blogs to browse is Simply Recipes. I can head over there when I have NO idea what to make and usually come away with at least three ideas in no time at all.\n\nThis time one of those ideas was [Basil Chicken in Coconut Curry Sauce](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/basil_chicken_in_coconut_curry_sauce/). It went on my must-make list immediately. Basil Chicken is good, but basil chicken curry is way, way better, especially if that curry is a coconut curry sauce!\n\nShould I Use Chicken Breasts or Chicken Thighs?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nYou can use either chicken breasts or chicken thighs for this recipe, so it's totally up to you. Though chicken breasts have fewer calories and less fat (including saturated fat) than chicken thighs ([source](https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines-and-myplate/breasts-vs-thighs-which-is-more-nutritious)) and are often more expensive than thighs, a lot of people like the flavor of thighs better.\n\nThough the original basil chicken curry recipe called for thighs, I opted for breasts and I have to tell you that this dish makes chicken breasts taste absolutely incredibly!\n\nI totally get how people often think they're dry, bland, and boring, but this recipe really makes them delicious (if you're looking for another great chicken breast recipe, try my [Panko Crusted Chicken](https://wearenotmartha.com/panko-crusted-chicken/)). That said, I'm absolutely positive thighs would be amazing, too.\n\nIf you happen to have chicken legs on hand, try these [chicken leg quarter recipes](https://www.orwhateveryoudo.com/2020/03/sweet-chili-chicken-leg-quarters.html)!\n\nWhy is There No Curry Powder in This Coconut Curry Sauce?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nA couple people have commented on this recipe and asked why there is no curry powder or garam masala listed in the recipe ingredients. That's because curry powder is really just a blend of spices and rather simply use curry powder here, we're making our own custom spice mixture.\n\nDo you have to do this? Well, no. If you don't have these spices in your pantry and prefer to keep things simple, you can use curry powder or garam masala and end up with a fairly similar recipe.\n\nHowever, I've found that the blend of spices used in this recipe makes my ideal coconut curry sauce, which is why I'm sharing it here.\n\nIn fact, you might try this recipe and decide you'd adjust the spice mixture next time due to your own personal preferences.\n\nFeel free to experiment and come up a spice mixture that appeals to you and your family best!\n\nIs the Curry Sauce Spicy?\n-------------------------\n\nThere are many different kinds of curry sauce and some are spicy and some aren't. This particular coconut curry sauce isn't very spicy (there's just a little chili powder in it), but because there are jalapeño peppers in the dish, it can get a little spicy.\n\nIf you're not a fan of spice or are serving this dish to kids, I recommend being sure to scrape the seeds out of the jalapeños before chopping. The seeds hold most of the heat, so if you just include the pepper part, you'll mainly be getting the flavor.\n\nHowever, you can always cut down on the amount of jalapeño, too.\n\nWith all that said, please don't be intimidated by the seemingly long list of ingredients in this basil chicken curry recipe. Lots of them are spices that you probably already have in your pantry (if not, you should because you'll definitely use them again!).\n\nDespite all those ingredients (spices), this basil chicken in coconut curry sauce is so, so easy.\n\nStart by mixing all those beautiful spices together in a small bowl. Then put your chicken pieces in a large bowl and sprinkle the spice mixture all over it. Let the chicken rest for about 30 minutes.\n\nHeat 1 Tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and jalapeño and cook for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook for one more minute.\n\nRemove the vegetables from the pan and put in a medium sized bowl and set aside.\n\n![Collage showing process for making basil chicken in coconut curry sauce, including curry spices in a white bowl, onion and jalapeño cooking in a skillet, and onion and jalapeño with garlic cooked and resting in a bowl](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-Making.jpg)\n\nUsing the same pan, add another Tbsp of oil and add half of the chicken pieces, spreading them out to make sure they're not overcrowded. Cook for a few minutes on each side to brown.\n\nWhen they're cooked through, remove from the pan and add them to the bowl of onion/jalapeño. Repeat with remaining chicken and remove that to the bowl, too.\n\n![Cubed chicken breasts covered in spice cooking in oil in a skillet](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Chicken-Cooking-2-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nNow for the coconut curry sauce! Add the coconut milk to the skillet and cook on medium-high and stir until it thickens a bit and gets bubbly.\n\nThen mix in the Worcestershire sauce.\n\nAdd the chicken and onion/jalapeño, along with basil and ginger and cook for 2 more minutes.\n\n![Overhead view of coconut curry sauce with chicken and basil cooking in it](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-Cooking-4-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nServe the basil chicken curry over rice... brown is always best! But obviously you can use whatever kind of rice you want. Or even quinoa. Or cauliflower rice.\n\nHeck, eat it right out of the skillet with a spoon if you want with nothing on the side. I won't tell.\n\nOh my goodness, this basil chicken in coconut curry sauce is so incredibly flavorful and satisfying! I didn't scrape the seeds out of my jalapeños (because we love heat in my house!), so this definitely had an extra kick to it.\n\n![Head on view of basil chicken in coconut curry sauce sitting on a bed of brown rice in a white bowl](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-9-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nI also decided to add more fresh basil over the top since I legit love fresh basil so much. And since this dish is called basil chicken curry and all, I figured it needed some extra!\n\nI've never actually attempted making my own curry, but this coconut curry sauce is something I'll most definitely be making again.\n\nThere are sooo many things that can be done with curry and I love it so much.\n\nThere are also so many kinds of curry and I want to make them all!\n\n![Landscape view of a white bowl filled with brown rice that's topped with basil chicken in coconut curry sauce with fresh basil on top](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-3-2-2-1024x683.jpg)\n\nLike I mentioned, you can definitely use chicken thighs for this recipe, but I was really happy I used chicken breasts because they ended up being so moist and flavorful when cooked in the spices and in the coconut curry sauce.\n\nSome people prefer using chicken thighs to breasts because breasts can be drier and less flavorful, but that is not the case with this recipe!\n\nMore Easy Chicken Dinner Recipes\n--------------------------------\n\nThere are so many boring chicken recipes out there, so I've made it one of my goals to only share chicken recipes that are incredibly flavorful and delicious. Oh, and they have to be easy, too!

It’s a hearty, bright and lemony dinner that makes great leftovers._\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with lemon wedges and sliced squash](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-2.jpg)\n\nChances are if you’re growing a garden or live by someone growing a garden, then right about now you have a bunch of zucchini and squash you need to use up. This healthy chicken recipe is the perfect use for it!\n\nMy brother, sister and mother-in-law all have gardens (I’m failing this year, someday I need to make time a grow a real deal garden. Last year I had one small box garden, I felt pretty cool) but they are are all generously sharing so much from their gardens (thank you!).\n\nMy brother was just telling me how quickly the zucchini and squash grow and he said he planted way too many, so lucky for me I get a bunch of them too. This skillet chicken recipe will be a new go-to use for all the summer squash and zucchini for me.\n\nThis lemon Parmesan chicken recipe is about as easy as it gets! Just some quick dicing for prep, then the chicken cooks in about 6 minutes and you set that aside and in the same skillet saute the zucchini and squash for about 4 minutes.\n\nThis is how you do simple weeknight dinners! Just be careful not to overcook the veggies as they will go from perfectly tender to mush in what seems like the blink of an eye.\n\nI just can’t get enough of these buttery-herb and lemony, garlic-Parmesan flavors! Make it soon, you’ll be glad you did!\n\nWatch the Video!\n----------------\n\n![Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini and Squash garnished with Parmesan and parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-9.jpg)\n\nLemon Parmesan Chicken Ingredients\n----------------------------------\n\nFor the chicken and zucchini skillet, you’ll need:\n\n*   Chicken breasts\n*   Olive oil\n*   Butter\n*   Salt and pepper\n*   Herbs and spices (Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder)\n*   Lemon zest and juice\n*   Zucchini\n*   Yellow squash\n*   Shredded Parmesan\n*   Fresh parsley\n\nHow to Cook Chicken in a Skillet\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Season diced chicken with herbs, spices and lemon zest, then cook in hot skillet with olive oil and butter.\n*   Transfer cooked chicken to plate and tent with foil to keep warm.\n*   Sauté zucchini and squash in that same skillet, seasoning with the same blend of herbs and spices.\n*   Return chicken to pan and drizzle in lemon juice. Sprinkle on Parmesan and garnish with fresh parsley, then toss to combine.\n*   Serve with your choice of rice, orzo, pasta, and more!\n\nCan I Use Chicken Thighs Instead of Breasts?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYes, you can use any cut of chicken you’d like here. I prefer using boneless, skinless chicken in this recipe, but feel free to use whatever you see fit.\n\nJust keep in mind that you may need to adjust the cook time slightly depending on how large you dice the chicken and what cut of meat you use.\n\nCan I Add More Veggies to This Chicken Skillet?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOf course! Lemon Parmesan chicken pairs well with almost any vegetable. I recommend using seasonal produce that cooks at roughly the same rate as the zucchini and squash (that way you’re not having to take ingredients in and out of the skillet to accommodate different cook times).\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with sliced zucchini and squash garnished with parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-6.jpg)\n\nTips for the Best Skillet Chicken and Veggies\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   Before cooking the chicken, dab it dry — preferably on both sides — and use a hot skillet.

Then with the motor still running, add olive oil in a slow stream until emulsified and creamy.\n    \n*   Drizzle olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat then add zucchini noodles, cooking for about 1 to 2 minutes until tender.\n    \n*   Add zucchini noodles to a large bowl and toss with avocado pesto.

    "markdown": "# Honey Lime Basil Peach Fruit Salad | Ambitious Kitchen\nA few years ago I fell in love with peaches. Not that they weren’t good all those years before, but it wasn’t until after having some sort of [peach pie or crisp](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/gluten-free-peach-crisp-salted-coconut-milk-caramel/) that I really committed to loving them like I’ve never loved a fruit before.\n\nExcept maybe Honeycrisp apples; those sweet crunchy things lure me in every time (even if they’re $4.99/pound). I know… shame on me.\n\nToday’s **peach fruit salad** is one that I make every time I entertain during the summer months; it’s the perfect side dish to accompany [grilled chicken](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/best-chicken-marinades/), [salmon](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/firecracker-salmon-with-peach-avocado-salsa/) or veggie [kabobs](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/vegan-turmeric-pineapple-tofu-kabobs/).\n\nAnother reason I dig this peach fruit salad? Because it’s a wonderful way to get kids to really dig into some fresh, nutritious fruit. The best part of this recipe though is that it’s completely customizable, so if you feel like adding other berries or fruit, you can! Sometimes I use yellow nectarines but usually, I opt for sweet, ripe fresh yellow peaches because of their unique sweetness and texture.\n\n![ingredients for peach fruit salad on a surface](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-1.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate. This summer peach fruit salad recipe is lightly tossed with honey, lime juice, and fresh basil leaves for a fresh side dish that's perfect for bbq's and parties!\")\n\nSummer fruit salad ingredients\n------------------------------\n\nBefore I save the above photo as the screensaver on my phone, let’s talk about what ingredients you’ll need to make this easy summer peach fruit salad. Head to the farmer’s market (or your own garden!) and grab:\n\n*   Fresh yellow peaches\n*   Blackberries\n*   Blueberries\n*   A pomegranate\n*   Fresh basil leaves\n*   Lime juice\n*   Honey\n\nThis fresh, summer produce is then drizzled with a bit of honey and a squeeze of lime juice for a sweet and tangy finish to the delicious fruit. I love how the basil brings a fresh earthiness and makes the fruit salad a bit different from what we’re used to.\n\n![summer peach fruit salad ingredients in a bowl with basil ribbons on top](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-2.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate. This summer peach fruit salad recipe is lightly tossed with honey, lime juice, and fresh basil leaves for a fresh side dish that's perfect for bbq's and parties!\")\n\nWhat to serve with this peach fruit salad\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis gorgeous summer fruit salad is best served with other delicious summer recipes. Here are some of my favorites:\n\n*   Add it to the perfect, [juicy grilled chicken](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-grill-chicken-breast/ \"How to Grill Chicken Breast that’s Perfectly Juicy\")\n*   Serve it on the side of a flavorful [burger](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/cheddar-bbq-chicken-burgers/ \"Seriously Good Sweet Potato Cheddar BBQ Chicken Burgers\") (or [vegan burger](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/ultimate-black-bean-burgers-with-tahini-garlic-cream/ \"Ultimate Vegan Black Bean Burgers with Creamy Tahini Garlic Sauce\")!)\n*   It’s delicious with grilled or baked [salmon](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/firecracker-salmon-with-peach-avocado-salsa/ \"Firecracker Salmon with Peach Avocado Salsa\")\n*   Everyone will love this with my [slow cooker pulled chicken sandwiches](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/slow-cooker-pulled-chicken-sandwiches/ \"Incredible Slow Cooker Pulled Chicken Sandwiches\")\n*   Simple [sweet & spice grilled chicken](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/grilled-ginger-chicken/ \"Sticky, Sweet & Spicy Grilled Ginger Chicken\") is the perfect complement\n\n![summer peach fruit salad in a bowl with basil ribbons](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-3.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate. This summer peach fruit salad recipe is lightly tossed with honey, lime juice, and fresh basil leaves for a fresh side dish that's perfect for bbq's and parties!\")\n\nCustomize this summer peach fruit salad\n---------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to make this fruit salad your own!\n\n*   **Go vegan.** Keep it vegan by omitting the honey or use a bit of maple syrup.\n*   **Add more summer fruits.** Feel free to add strawberries, raspberries, nectarine or fresh cherries!\n*   **Choose your herbs.** Swap the basil for fresh mint.\n*   **Add a kick of heat.** Get a little wild with a sprinkle of chili powder or cayenne pepper.\n*   **Make a meal.** Add some feta or goat cheese crumbles, creamy avocado and your favorite greens like arugula or spinach to make a light lunch salad!\n\nWhat fruit is best for fruit salad?\n-----------------------------------\n\nI have found that fruit salad is best with firm berries and other fruit that doesn’t easily break down or get mushy so if you want to prep the salad a few hours ahead of time, you totally can. I suggest avoiding raspberries, watermelon and bananas, as they can easily get soggy. Make sure that when you add peaches they aren’t overly ripe and still have some firmness to them!\n\n![summer peach fruit salad on a platter with basil](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-4.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate. This summer peach fruit salad recipe is lightly tossed with honey, lime juice, and fresh basil leaves for a fresh side dish that's perfect for bbq's and parties!\")\n\nHow to store this peach fruit salad\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis peach fruit salad will stay good for about 2-4 days in the refrigerator in [airtight containers](https://amzn.to/3Sbl9Xu). The acid from the lime juice will also help prevent the peaches from browning and will keep the rest of the fruit tasting nice and fresh. It’s great to toss in quinoa, on top of spinach, or on top of a bowl of yogurt in the morning.\n\nMake it ahead of time\n---------------------\n\nIf you want to make this peach fruit salad ahead of time, feel free to add everything to a bowl 1 day before you’re ready to serve it. I would recommend adding the basil ribbons last so that they keep their pretty green color when tossed with the salad.\n\nI mean, come on… don’t you want to just dive in?\n\nDon’t lie to me.\n\nMore peach recipes you’ll love\n------------------------------\n\n*   [Almond Butter Peach Blueberry Oatmeal Cups](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/almond-butter-peach-blueberry-oatmeal-cups/ \"Almond Butter Peach Blueberry Oatmeal Cups\")\n*   [Chipotle Lime Salmon Tacos with Corn Avocado Peach Salsa & Cilantro Yogurt Sauce](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/chipotle-salmon-tacos/ \"Chipotle Lime Salmon Tacos with Corn Avocado Peach Salsa & Cilantro Yogurt Sauce\")\n*   [Grilled Peaches (+6 different topping ideas!)](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/grilled-peaches/ \"Grilled Peaches (+6 different topping ideas!)\")\n*   [Peach Brussels Sprouts Crunch Salad with Creamy Tahini Poppy Seed Dressing](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/peach-brussels-sprouts-salad/ \"Peach Brussels Sprouts Crunch Salad with Creamy Tahini Poppy Seed Dressing\")\n*   [Gluten Free Peach Crisp with Salted Coconut Milk Caramel](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/gluten-free-peach-crisp-salted-coconut-milk-caramel/ \"Gluten Free Peach Crisp with Salted Coconut Milk Caramel\")\n\nGet all of my peach recipes [here](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/ingredient/peach/)!\n\n_I hope you love this gorgeous summer peach fruit salad.

Please read my [disclosure policy](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_This roasted sweet potato and arugula salad recipe features some of my favorite fall flavors and always tastes so delicious this time of year._\n\n![Favorite Fall Salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-8.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette. It's the perfect vegetarian salad for fall and always so delicious! | gimmesomeoven.com\")\n\nThings are finally _(fi-na-lly!)_ cooling off here in Barcelona this week after the summer’s unrelenting heat wave, which of course instantly has me craving all of my nostalgic fall faves…including this yummy roasted sweet potato and arugula salad. ♡\n\nIt’s a simple one that you could easily make anytime of year. But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like. And if you feel like adding in an extra protein, some grilled chicken or bacon would be delicious mixed in too.\n\nLet’s make some salad together!  \n\n![Favorite Fall Salad Ingredients](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-1.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

We’ll then dice them into 1/2-inch cubes, toss with olive oil, season generously with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n*   **Greens:** I’m partial to the peppery flavor of fresh arugula in this salad, but you could also use baby kale (or other varieties of kale), baby spinach, or any other salad greens that you prefer.\n*   **Avocado:** Feel free to dice or thinly slice the avocado, which adds a lovely creaminess to the salad.\n*   **Crumbled cheese:** I love the tart and tangy flavor of goat cheese in this salad, but feta, blue, cheddar, or Manchego cheese would be delicious alternatives too.\n*   **Nuts:** Just about any of your favorite nuts or seeds will work well in this salad — pecans, walnuts, almonds, pepitas, you choose!\n*   **Dried berries:** Dried cranberries always feel so quintessentially fall-ish to me, but dried cherries, raisins or even apricots would work well too.\n*   **Dressing:** My [everyday salad dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/salad-dressing/) goes beautifully with this salad, made with a quick blend of olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, garlic, salt and pepper.\n\n![Step by step instructions for how to make favorite fall salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fall-Salad-Collage.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

For example, you are welcome to…\n\n*   **Add a protein:** Cooked chicken, bacon, steak, shrimp or tofu would be delicious mixed in here.\n*   **Add other mix-ins:** Extra roasted veggies (such as beets, butternut squash, carrots, fennel, green beans or pumpkin), extra fresh veggies (bell pepper, radishes, red onion), rice or grains (quinoa, farro, wild rice), beans, olives, or sun-dried tomatoes would be other fun options for mix-ins.\n*   **Use a different dressing:** I also love making this salad with my [dreamy tahini dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/dreamy-tahini-dressing/) for a different spin on the recipe.\n*   **Make it vegan:** Swap your favorite vegan cheese in place of goat cheese, or omit the cheese altogether and add in a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.\n\n![Favorite Fall Salad in Bowl with Lemon Vinaigrette](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-5.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-e1541953546118.jpg)\n\nThen roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-e1541953605651.jpg)\n\nUsing your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame.\n\nLightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce remove excess dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-e1541953690862.jpg)\n\nLift your tray and carefully turn upside down on a parchment paper lined baking tray. \n\nThe pumpkin ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. \n\nCollect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of pumpkin raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n\nAdd your fresh pumpkin ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. \n\nsage butter, apples and pecans\n------------------------------\n\nWhile your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat.  You want to stir them often or they will burn. \n\nCook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant.  Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside.\n\nNext, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat.  Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce apples and butter](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-e1541953820985.jpg)\n\nThen add your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 – 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry.\n\nOnce your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumpkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat.  Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n\n**pro tips for perfect pumpkin ravioli**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don’t want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don’t forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can’t emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don’t!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 – 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn’t seem like much but you don’t want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce bowl](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-e1541953937768.jpg)\n\n**can you make ravioli without a pasta machine?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely!

Is it just me, or is pumpkin everywhere this year?! Pumpkin Spice Cookies, Pumpkin Spice Cereal, Pumpkin Spice Peanut Butter, and of course, the iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte. It’s a bit overwhelming – I even have a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/Platingspairing/pumpkin/) dedicated solely to Pumpkin.\n\nIn an effort to keep up with the Pumpkin-wielding Jonses, I’m throwing this Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese & Dried Cranberries into the mix.\n\nWhile some people may have a _pumpkin_ obsession, my obsession generally lies with [risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/category/recipes/risotto/). Like my [Lemon Mascarpone Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/lemon-mascarpone-risotto/), [Beet Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/beet-risotto-goat-cheese/) and [Grilled Shrimp Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/grilled-shrimp-risotto/).\n\nNot only do I like eating risotto, but I thoroughly enjoy the process of making it – Mainly because I get to stand over a hot stove when it’s freezing cold outside. Freezing cold = 60 degrees and below in my book.\n\nThe process of making risotto is easy, but it does take some babysitting because you need to “feed” the risotto. We’re _feeding_ the risotto with a ladle full of stock time after time, letting it fully absorb between each addition.\n\nThe process takes about 20 minutes from start to finish, and it’s a full evolution. The risotto starts as hard grains of rice, then it becomes more plump, and then, through all the stirring and the feeding, it takes on the most incredible creamy texture that’s tasty on it’s own, but also totally customizable with any ingredients of your choosing.\n\n[![Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese and Dried Cranberries in bowl with a Barolo wine pairing.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pumpkin-risotto-6-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/pumpkin-risotto-6-2/)\n\nThis is the most amazing fall risotto. The [pumpkin](http://amzn.to/2kDojCT) and [dried cranberries](http://amzn.to/2kDhsJS) just call out Thanksgiving to me. Plus, I’m making this risotto totally meat free, meaning that it would be a perfect option to serve for a vegetarian Thanksgiving.\n\nThe creamy pumpkin lends a rich, earthy flavor to the mix, the goat cheese adds tang and creaminess, and the dried cranberries give zing and add their beautiful color to the dish.\n\nHow to make ahead & reheat\n--------------------------\n\n*   **To store:** Keep any leftover risotto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n*   **To reheat:** Place the leftovers into a pan with a bit of extra broth and heat over medium heat until warmed through.\n\nHere’s a full post with my tips on [how to reheat risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/how-to-reheat-risotto/).\n\n[![Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese and Dried Cranberries in bowl - Close up shot.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pumpkin-risotto-4-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/pumpkin-risotto-4-2/)\n\n🍽 Serving suggestions\n----------------------\n\n*   [Easy Arugula Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/perfect-green-arugula-salad/)\n*   [Sauteed Spinach](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/easy-sauteed-spinach-recipe/)\n*   [Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/brussels-sprouts-salad/)\n*   [Vegan Caesar Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/vegan-caesar-salad/)\n*   [Shaved Fennel Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/fennel-celery-salad/)\n*   **MORE —> 35+ EASY [sides for risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/what-to-serve-with-risotto/)!**\n\nWhat’s your favorite pumpkin dish or product of the season?

Mine vary from [smoked mackerel and pea risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/smoked-mackerel-risotto/) and [tomato risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/tomato-risotto/) all the way through to a delicious [black pudding risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/black-pudding-risotto-with-bacon-and-peas/) and [chicken and chorizo risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/chicken-and-chorizo-risotto/).\n\nI find the whole process of adding stock and stirring whilst sipping wine and listening to music very cathartic and incredibly relaxing.\n\nThis butternut squash risotto recipe uses some of the finest autumnal ingredients that just work well together to create comfort food heaven.\n\nThe roasted butternut squash puree is joined by sage, which is a wonderful flavour combination.\n\nI round it all out with some crumbled blue cheese, I use Roquefort, and that’s it, job done!\n\nThis cooking malarkey is simple!\n\nIt is nothing more than a series of simple techniques which can all be learned.\n\n[![Close-up butternut squash and sage risotto served with Roquefort cheese.](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-02.jpg)](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-02.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**What risotto rice should I use?**\n\nI base all of my risotto recipes on Arborio rice because it is the most commonly available.\n\nThis recipe is equally good, if not better made with carnaroli rice, rice that has a higher starch content which leads to an even creamier mouthfeel.\n\n**Can I use a different type of squash?**\n\nYes, absolutely. My cooking is very much focused on cooking for two, and as a result butternut squash is the logical choice.\n\nYou can often buy small ones that leave no waste, but you can use whatever you like.\n\n**What can I do with leftover** **butternut squash?**\n\nIf you can only get your hands on a larger squash, don’t worry, here are a few options that will help you use the leftovers\n\n*   [Burmese Pumpkin Curry](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/pumpkin-curry-with-tamarind/).\n*   [Roasted Butternut Squash Pasta](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/butternut-squash-pasta/).\n*   [Butternut Squash Chilli](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/pumpkin-chili/).\n*   [Butternut Squash Tagine](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/butternut-squash-tagine-with-almonds-and-apricots/).\n\n**How do I store leftover squash?**\n\nTry and keep it in a large “lump”, so cut it in half and roast half for this recipe. Then tightly wrap the other half in cling film and keep it in the fridge. You should get 3 or 4 days out of it.\n\n**Can I use a different blue cheese?**\n\nYes, you could use everything from gorgonzola to Danish blue and all the way through to the mighty Stilton, choose something that you like!\n\n**Can I use dried sage?**\n\nYes, depending on how fresh your dried sage is use between half and one tablespoon.\n\n[![Roasted butternut squash and sage risotto served with Roquefort cheese.](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-04.jpg)](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-04.jpg)\n\nServing Suggestions\n-------------------\n\nRisotto is a wonderful one-bowl meal of loveliness that needs little else, and this roasted butternut squash number is no different!\n\nHowever, I almost always serve a risotto with some form of bread, I prefer either some toasted ciabatta or fresh focaccia.\n\nMy wife prefers [garlic bread](https://www.thedinnerbite.com/baguette-garlic-bread/) or [cheesy garlic bread](https://biteontheside.com/homemade-easy-cheesy-garlic-bread/) so I’ll leave it for you to guess who usually wins.\n\nHowever, we both agree that the rest of the left over wine must be consumed with the risotto!\n\n[![Overhead close-up butternut squash and sage risotto served with Roquefort cheese.](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-05.jpg)](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-05.jpg)\n\nEquipment Used\n--------------\n\nI only name-check brands of equipment if I think that they make a material difference to a recipe. But if you have any questions feel free to ask them in the comments section below the recipe.\n\n*   Stovetop.\n*   Oven.\n*   Roasting dish.\n*   28cm or 11″ frying pan or skillet.\n*   Small saucepan to keep the stock warm.\n*   Ladle, stirring and serving spoons.\n*   Spoon and fork for scooping out and mashing the butternut squash.\n*   Kitchen knife.\n*   Chopping board.\n*   Weighing scales and or measuring jug, cups and spoons.\n\n_Prep Time:_ 10 minutes\n\n_Cook Time:_ 1 hour 15 minutes\n\n_Total Time:_ 1 hour 25 minutes\n\nRoasted butternut squash puree is at the heart of this delicious and comforting risotto recipe which is paired with the classic flavours of sage and blue cheese.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 Small (500g) Butternut Squash\n*   1-2 Tbsp Olive Oil\n*   ½ Tsp Coarse Sea Salt\n*   ½ Tsp Black Pepper\n*   175g (¾ Cup) Risotto Rice\n*   30g (2 Tbsp) Butter\n*   35g (1 Small) Banana Shallot\n*   50g (1 Stick) Celery\n*   2 Garlic Cloves\n*   175ml (¾ Cup) White Wine\n*   500ml-650ml (2½ Cups) Vegetable Stock\n*   16-24 Sage Leaves\n*   100g (1 Cup) Roquefort Cheese\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds, place it in a roasting dish, drizzle over the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 55-60 minutes at 180°C or 350°F and set aside to cool a little.\n2.  Cut the shallot in half, peel it and then dice it as finely as you can.\n3.  Dice the celery as finely as you can.\n4.  Peel the garlic and dice it as finely as you can.\n5.  Cut the sage leaves into thin strips.\n6.  Heat the vegetable stock to a slow simmer.\n7.  Heat a 28cm or 11\" frying pan or skillet over a medium-high heat and add the butter.\n8.  When the butter begins to foam add the diced shallot and and celery and cook until softened, this will take around 4-5 minutes. If they begin to colour reduce the heat a little.\n9.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.\n10.  Pour in the risotto rice and stir until the grains become translucent at the edges, this should take 2-3 minutes.\n11.  Add the shredded sage, pour over the white wine and stir until almost all of the wine has evaporated/been incorporated into the rice.\n12.  Turn the heat down a little and slowly stir in the hot vegetable stock a ladle full at a time. Stirring continually, making sure almost all of the stock has been incorporated each time and the pan is almost dry. As you get to the end of the cooking process you can add more stock at a time.\n13.  Repeat this until all of the stock is incorporated and the rice is cooked with a very slight bite which should take between 25 and 35 mins.\n14.  Scoop the roasted squash from the skins which should be cool enough to handle now, and mash with a fork to form a puree. It should yield around 300g or 1 cup of roasted butternut squash puree.\n15.  Stir the squash puree into the risotto and cook until it is all incorporated and creamy, then remove from the heat and add a lid, letting the dish sit for 5 minutes.\n16.  Whilst the risotto is relaxing crumble the Roquefort cheese, then serve the risotto topped with the crumbled cheese.\n\n#### Nutrition Information:\n\n#### Yield:\n\n2\n\n#### Serving Size:\n\n1  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 486Total Fat: 29gSaturated Fat: 18gTrans Fat: 1gUnsaturated Fat: 9gCholesterol: 76mgSodium: 1489mgCarbohydrates: 37gFiber: 3gSugar: 6gProtein: 10g\n\n_Calorific details are provided by a third-party application and are to be used as indicative figures only._"

We ate leftovers for every meal on Friday, switched it up with [tacos](https://www.thekitchn.com/beef-taco-recipe-23020688) on Saturday, and ordered [pizza](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-really-good-pizza-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-178384) on Sunday because we still didn’t feel like cooking. The next few days for lunch will probably be more leftovers, because I can’t see beyond the mountain of plastic-wrapped [mashed potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-180434) and [stuffing](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-the-very-best-thanksgiving-stuffing-237564) in the fridge to even try and dig for a fresh vegetable.\n\nWhen I do break free and get back to some type of normalcy, I know exactly what I’ll be eating to help me reset.

Everything roasts together in the oven: big cubes of [sweet potato](https://www.thekitchn.com/roasted-sweet-potatoes-263158), crunchy pepitas, and even oversized crumbles of feta, which take on this wonderful chewy-creamy texture when warmed. Instead of sautéing the [cauliflower rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice-couscous-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203344) (buy it pre-riced to save time), you’ll also throw it into the oven. Tossing it with [turmeric](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipes-with-turmeric-223795) gives it a gorgeous golden hue and a slightly earthy flavor.\n\nWhile everything’s roasting, you’ll mix up a fresh bean salad: a [can of chickpeas](https://www.thekitchn.com/chickpea-recipes-234833), a handful of [herbs](https://www.thekitchn.com/your-guide-to-storing-fresh-herbs-in-the-fridge-231412), a drizzle of [olive oil](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-olive-oil-and-extra-virgin-olive-oil-word-of-mouth-218767), and a squeeze of [lime juice](https://www.thekitchn.com/5-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-juice-from-limes-amp-lemons-tips-from-the-kitchn-119886). Pile onto the [roasted veg](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221), then enjoy for lunch right after it’s made or divvy into lunch containers and eat throughout the week. You don’t even need to futz with a dressing — just drizzle with more oil and a squeeze a lime juice before diving in.\n\nThe flexibility of this recipe makes it extra budget-friendly. Use whatever root vegetable you have on hand or is on sale at the grocery store. Buy pepitas in the bulk section, or swap out another nut or seed that’s already stashed in your pantry. It’s delicious any way you make it.\n\n[Comments](#comments-263225)\n\nAn easy, protein-packed vegetarian lunch bowl made with cauliflower rice, sweet potatoes, and a vibrant chickpea salad.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    root vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, or a combination, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes\n    \n*   4 tablespoons\n    \n    olive oil, divided, plus more for serving\n    \n*   1 1/2 teaspoons\n    \n    kosher salt, divided\n    \n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n    \n*   4 ounces\n    \n    feta cheese, drained\n    \n*   1/4 cup\n    \n    pumpkin seeds\n    \n*   3 cups\n    \n    fresh or frozen cauliflower rice, such as Trader Joe's\n    \n*   1/2 teaspoon\n    \n    ground turmeric\n    \n*   1 (15.5-ounce) can\n    \n    chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1/2 cup\n    \n    coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems\n    \n*   Finely grated zest of 2 medium limes\n    \n*   Juice of 2 medium limes, plus more wedges for serving\n    \n*   1\n    \n    medium avocado, pitted and quartered\n    \n\n1.  Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to 425°F. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, then season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and several grinds of black pepper. Toss to combine, then arrange into an even layer. Roast on the lower rack until beginning to brown, about 20 minutes.\n    \n2.  Flip the sweet potatoes and push them to one side. Add the pumpkin seeds to the now-empty portion of the baking sheet and crumble the feta into large pieces over the sweet potatoes. Place the cauliflower rice (if using frozen, break up any clumps first), turmeric, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and several grinds of black pepper on a second rimmed baking sheet and toss until evenly combined. Spread into an even layer.\n    \n3.  Place the sweet potatoes on the upper rack and the cauliflower rice on the lower rack. Roast until the pumpkin seeds are toasted, the sweet potatoes are golden-brown, and the feta is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl and toss until evenly coated; set aside.\n    \n4.  **For each serving:** Transfer 1/4 of the rice, 1/4 of the sweet potato and feta mixture, and 1/4 of the chickpea mixture into a bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the pepitas and top with a piece of the avocado (peel the avocado if eating immediately). Drizzle with more olive oil and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve with a lime wedge.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Storage:** Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."

Using a meat mallet or the bottom of your fry pan, pound breasts to even thickness (you don't want the meat super-flat, just even in thickness). Place the prepared chicken in a large sealable plastic bag and set aside.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon lime zest, 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, minced garlic, honey, cumin, coriander, and salt and pepper (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of each; add to your preference). Once the mixture is well combined, remove 3 tablespoons of the mixture and reserve for later.\n    \n*   Add the rest of the marinade to the bag with the chicken. Seal the bag and then knead with your hands to ensure all of the chicken is well coated. Place in the fridge and marinate for at least 30 minutes and preferably 2-3 hours. Don't marinate longer than 6 hours. (Acid from lime begins to \"cook\" the chicken.)\n    \n*   Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (about 400 degrees F.). Generously oil the grill (I drench a roll-up paper towel in vegetable oil and, holding it with tongs, rub it over the grill grates. Don't skip this step.) Start by grilling the pineapple **(See Note 1)** so you can work on the salsa while the chicken cooks. Rub about 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil over all sides of the pineapple. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.\n    \n*   Remove chicken from marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.\n    \n*   While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.\n    \n*   We like to serve Pineapple Chicken with coconut rice or cilantro-lime rice. If you'd like those recipes, check for the links to those recipes right above this recipe card!\n    \n\n**Note** **1**: You don't have to grill the pineapple, but it does add an amazing sweetness (it caramelizes as it grills) to the dish. Check pictures in the post for the size of pineapple to grill. (I cut the cored and peeled the pineapple and cut into about 9 or 10 long strips.) Once grilled, I slice each pineapple strip in 3 long strips and then dice those long strips into small pieces for the salsa. Use a sharp knife here! You will likely have more pineapple salsa than needed to top chicken, but we like a lot--or finish the rest off with chips. You can halve the pineapple salsa recipe, but I like it as written, so I don't waste the rest of the veggies.\n\n**Note 2**: A good, ripe avocado adds a delicious creamy element to this dish. If you don't add avocado and want a creamy element, I'd recommend the [jalapeno sauce from this recipe](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/jamaican-jerk-tacos/).

This girl!\n\nOf course it took posting a photo of this plate-o-yum on IG to give me the push I needed. I have some very awesome friends with some very impatient squash (_squashes? squashi? I think I’m overthinking this!_) awaiting this recipe. I had to deliver!\n\nWithout further ado, here’s my  all-time favorite butternut squash recipe. Hands-down. No question.\n\nThis savory sweet side dish is perfect for the holidays and you should totally make it right now!\n\nWell, make it now, and then make it AGAIN for the holidays.\n\nAll of them.\n\n_Duh._\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta One Pan Sheet Pan Recipe](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-0208.jpg)\n\nso . . . how is it?!\n--------------------\n\nDelightfully delicious! The combination of sweetness from the butternut squash and honey paired perfectly with the tart and juicy cranberries is a thing of beauty!\n\nThe dish is super customizable too, so feel free to make it as sweet or sassy as you’d like. The feta adds a delightful twist, and can easily be swapped for an uber creamy goat cheese as well. I hope you love this tasty holiday side dish as much as we do! It’s become a staple in our house and I have a feeling it will be for years to come!\n\nThis simple side can be whipped up with just a few fresh ingredients and is loaded with Fall flavor.\n\nAs an added bonus, as the butternut squash roasts away it fills the house with the most delicious aromas. I had to hold myself back from climbing in the oven with it after the twenty minute mark. It was a little less Sylvia Plath and a little more was more “_LET ME AT THAT SQUASH!_” I may have stolen a few cubes to munch on when I added the cranberries. _So good!_\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta - This sweet and savory side dish is perfect for the holidays and loaded with Fall flavor!](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-feta-recipe-thanksgiving-0245-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 3 lb large butternut squash (peeled + chopped)\n*   ▢ 1-2 TBSP [extra virgin olive oil](https://amzn.to/2QvhPq6)\n*   ▢ salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste\n*   ▢ 1-2 cups fresh cranberries (add a little, or a lot!)\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP honey plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ ¼ cup finely crumbled feta\n*   ▢ ground cinnamon to taste \n*   ▢ fresh or dried parsley to garnish, optional\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F.\n    \n*   Lightly drizzle or spritz a baking sheet with olive oil.\n    \n*   Add cubed squash to the sheet along with another drizzle of olive oil.\n    \n*   Sprinkle with a light layer of salt, pepper, and garlic powder, based on taste preference.\n    \n*   Roast at 400 F for 25 minutes on the center rack.\n    \n*   At the 25 minute mark, pull out the oven rack, and add your fresh cranberries to the roasting pan.\n    \n*   Return to the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cranberries have started to soften and burst a bit, resembling really juicy craisins vs fresh firm cranberries.\n    \n*   Remove from oven and add a sprinkle of cinnamon (approx. 1/8-1/4 tsp depending on preference) along with feta and honey. I listed the honey measurements I used, but depending on whether you used fresh cranberries or dried, sweeten to taste.\n    \n*   Garnish with parsley for a burst of color and dig in while it's hot!\n    \n\nFeel free to use fresh or dried cranberries for this dish.\n\nDried will be sweeter, while fresh with have a delightful punch of tartness to pair with the buttery squash and sweet honey.

I still bake with it because it’s an awesome natural sweetener and I adore it so, but if I have the option to keep it as close to raw as possible, I do. Hence adding the honey after roasting the squash and cranberries in this recipe. The fruit and veggie medley is still just warm enough to allow the honey to cover the dish as a deliciously sweet glaze, but not so scorching that it’s spending 30+ minutes in my oven losing all it’s fabulous benefits.\n\n_File this under things I tell myself so I can eat more honey._\n\nIf you’re as squash obsessed as I am right now, you should totally take your Fall/Winter menu up a few notches and try my [Cheesy Garlic Parmesan Spaghetti Squash](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/09/cheesy-garlic-parmesan-spinach-spaghetti-squash.html) and Butternut Cauliflower Soup.\n\nSO DELICIOUS!\n\nIf you get a chance to try this Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta, let me know!\n\nYou can leave me a comment here (LOVE checking those daily!) or tag @PEASandCRAYONS #PEASANDCRAYONS on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peasandcrayons) so I can happy dance over your creations!

I’ve done some experimenting and here’s what I’ve got so far!\n\nI’ve found the best advance-prep results were when I pre-roasted the squash for around 25-30 minutes and then before serving, I tossed the room temperature squash back in the oven along with the cranberries for an additional 10 minutes or so until the cranberries started to burst and the squash crisped back up around the edges (yet still creamy and buttery on the inside!). I reheated it in the oven just before serving so the feta and honey were added to the still-warm dish and it worked great!\n\nI have also cooked the squash and berries in their entirety and popped them in the fridge. I let it come to room temp for a bit then reheated them in the oven for around 10 minutes before serving, adding the cheese/honey after as well. The first method had more of the texture I was looking for but the results from this method were still good!\n\nLet me know if you find another method that works great for you as well!\n\nLast year I even slapped the leftover honey roasted butternut squash with cranberries on an epic Thanksgiving leftover sandwich (with all the fixings) and it was amazing!\n\nPeas and Crayons is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites at no cost to readers.\n\n[![Jenn Laughlin Headshot Photo - About the Author](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jenn-laughlin-headshot-peasandcrayons--scaled-e1716318471546-600x600.jpg)](https://peasandcrayons.com/about)\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nJenn Laughlin\n-------------\n\nJenn Laughlin created Peas and Crayons in 2009 after graduating with B.S. in Dietetics from Florida State University while working as a Nutrition Educator for WIC.

Double cream has a **butterfat percentage of 48%**. It is so high that it is easily over whipped and quickly will turn to butter. Double cream is not commonly found in the United States but check with your local dairy to see if they offer it.\n\n**Heavy cream** or **heavy whipping cream** contains the next highest butterfat percentage at **36-38%.** This recipe calls for heavy cream but if you can't find heavy cream, **whipping cream** is your next best substitute at **30% butterfat.**\n\n![](https://www.savoringthegood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/61d9acd099004daddf058ab0d5dd0cfe.jpg)\n\nDelicious!👌🏼\n--------------\n\n_Pinterest: Chris D_\n\nHow do you make IKEA Swedish meatballs?\n---------------------------------------\n\n![3 photos showing how to make the meatballs for swedish meatballs from Ikea](https://www.savoringthegood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/how-to-make-swedish-meatballs.jpg)\n\n1.

This creamy pumpkin pasta with toasted walnuts and spinach dish is as flavorful as it is nutritious. Serve it for a fall dinner party or quick weeknight meal._ \n\n![Overhead Pumpkin Pasta with Spinach in bowls with fork](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/522A0433.jpg)\n\nI shared this creamy pumpkin pasta with a room full of people at my “all about pumpkin demo” a couple of weeks ago. Though they loved the smell of it, there were more than a few side-eyes in the room. No one had used pumpkin in pasta before and let’s just say they were skeptical but curious. Well. It was a hit!\n\nMost people said they couldn’t taste the pumpkin. And that’s not surprising. Pumpkin doesn’t have a strong flavor. The flavors we associate with pumpkin usually come from the spices paired with it. There is one major exception. Fresh pumpkin can be incredible when it’s roasted until it’s caramelized and sweet.\n\n[This 20-minute Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts & Spinach is perfect for fall!](https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=This%2020-minute%20Pumpkin%20Pasta%20with%20Toasted%20Walnuts%20%26amp%3B%20Spinach%20is%20perfect%20for%20fall%21%20%23easyrecipes&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarisamoore.com%2Fpumpkin-pasta-toasted-walnuts-spinach%2F&via=marisamoore)\n\nThat’s not what I’m using today. Maybe later. Today, I used leftover canned pumpkin to make a luscious, silky smooth pumpkin pasta sauce that’s full of nutrition. It’s got vitamin C, beta-carotene, and fiber which can help keep the immune system and your skin glowing as the weather starts to cool down.\n\nYou can use any pasta you’d like. For more protein and fiber but without changing the flavor of the dish too much, I suggest using chickpea pasta. I prefer it to whole wheat or some of the other “healthy” pasta options.\n\nIf you’re living on the edge, boil some water and cook some old school, regular white pasta! I’m just being sarcastic. Use the pasta that works for you and your family. Just don’t overcook it.\n\nCan you make a dairy-free pumpkin sauce?\n----------------------------------------\n\nYes. I used a little half and half in this recipe because it adds a lovely texture and richness to the sauce. If you are avoiding dairy, try adding a bit more olive oil and broth instead of milk or cream. This substitution will also make the recipe more of a pantry meal.\n\nThe parmesan is, of course, a nice savory, salty addition. You can leave it out for a vegan recipe. If you find that the recipe needs a little something else, add a little What’s the Deal with Nutritional Yeast? to the sauce and blend until smooth.\n\n![Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts and Spinach in bowls with two forks](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Exported-4-2.jpg)\n\nHow to make pumpkin pasta sauce\n-------------------------------\n\nFor the sauce: sauté fresh garlic in olive oil just until fragrant. Add the other ingredients and let it simmer. I found that this sauce tastes better the longer it simmers. It tastes even better the next day, so it’s the perfect pumpkin pasta sauce for meal prep! I stored it in a mason jar and used it throughout the week. It also freezes well on its own.\n\nOnce the pumpkin sauce is ready,  add a couple of large handfuls of baby spinach. Add in the pasta and heat the dish just until all are heated through and the spinach wilts.\n\n![Front view Pumpkin Pasta with Spinach in bowls with fork](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pumpkin-Pasta-with-Spinach-in-bowls-with-fork-at-bottom.jpg)\n\nDish it up and top with roasted walnuts and grated Parmesan to make it pretty and to add extra flavor and texture. This pumpkin pasta dish would be an impressive vegetarian dish to serve at fall dinner parties but it’s also quick and easy enough for a fast weeknight meal.\n\nKids and adults will both love it. It’s also a tasty way to use up any extra canned pumpkin you might have leftover. This recipe will keep in the fridge for about 3 days.\n\nWays to use up leftover canned pumpkin\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you open up a new can of pumpkin for this recipe and need to use up the rest, here are a few [tips for using up leftover pumpkin](https://marisamoore.com/how-to-use-leftover-canned-pumpkin-puree/):\n\n1.  Double this pumpkin pasta sauce recipe. I’m a huge fan of cooking (and cleaning) once and eating twice! You won’t regret having an extra batch of this sauce ready to go in a month.\n2.  Make my easy [homemade pumpkin spice granola](https://marisamoore.com/healthy-pumpkin-spice-granola/)!\n3.  Stir extra pumpkin into oats or Greek yogurt.\n4.

Cook until it lightly wilts.\n    \n*   Stir in pasta and toss to coat. Sprinkle with walnuts and Parmesan, if desired and serve. \n    \n\n**Tips for making pumpkin pasta sauce:**\n\n*   Adjust the salt based on the broth you use. For example, if you are using a lower sodium broth, add salt to suit your taste!\n*   Store the pasta sauce in a mason jar for a few days. It tastes better the day after you make it!\n*   Reheat the pumpkin sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Add warm broth to help thin it out if needed.\n\nCalories: 388kcal\n\n[Let us know](#comment) how it was!"

Grilled Greek chicken (or roasted), served bowl style with orzo, roasted peppers, avocado, feta cheese, cucumbers, and the most deliciously addicting sizzled mint goddess sauce. It doesn’t get easier or more delicious than this grilled chicken…simple, quick, extra colorful, super flavorful, and so delicious. The perfect dinner to serve any night of the week!\n\n![overhead photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and olive on table](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-1-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nBasically I am full on ready for summer, and this recipe proves it. I know it’s only mid April, but in my defense, I feel like most everyone (in the US at least) is slowly beginning to experience warmer days that are fit for grilling. Are you? My fingers are crossed that you are, but if not, don’t worry, you can easily roast this chicken too!\n\nEither way, this is the perfect recipe for Monday. It also feels very April appropriate – healthy, colorful, and delicious! All very important things.\n\nWith Easter this Sunday, I have Greek food on my mind. Something about Easter always inspires me to create recipes with a Greek influence. I say influence because I know that my recipes may not be traditional, but this is my personal spin on a more traditional recipe.\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5032-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5052-700x1050.jpg)\n\nLast year I even made my first [spanakopita](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-spinach-and-feta-pie-spanakopita/ \"Greek Spinach and Feta Pie (Spanakopita).\") (Greek spinach and feta pie), along with these [Greek orzo stuffed peppers](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-orzo-stuffed-red-peppers/ \"Greek Orzo Stuffed Red Peppers with Lemony Basil Tomatoes.\")! Both of which are some of my favorite spring and summer recipes. And then there’s these [Greek lamb meatballs](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-lamb-meatballs-with-avocado-goddess-sauce/ \"Greek Lamb Meatballs with Avocado Goddess Sauce.\"), which so many of you have made and seem to have loved. Those meatballs inspired this recipe. Ever since I made those meatballs a year ago, I have been obsessed with the recipe. I make it every chance I get, which honestly is not often enough, as I’m consistently testing new recipes.\n\nPoint is, I love the flavors so very much, but more often than not I end up having chicken on hand opposed to ground lamb. Soo, enter the chicken version of these bowls. But made in a very different way, because well, I never seem to make the same recipe twice. Both bowls are SO GOOD, but right now I am all about this Greek chicken.\n\nAnd it feels kind of fitting for Easter, doesn’t it?\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5054-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5065-700x1050.jpg)\n\nI marinate the chicken in quite possibly one of my favorite marinades. It’s a combination of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika (which is not really “Greek”…but it’s good), fresh oregano, shallots (the secret!), garlic, and lots of lemon (always so much lemon). Now, when I say marinate, I really just mean toss the chicken in this mix and let it sit while you get everything else for the bowls together. I’m not sure about you guys, but I can never plan ahead enough to cook a recipe requiring a long marinate time.\n\nIt almost never happens…\n\nSo, I do a quick marinade. It works.\n\n![close up photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-2-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nWhile the chicken is “marinating”, make the sizzled mint goddess sauce.\n\nHere’s the truth, I really do not love mint. I find it overpowers most recipe. Unless it’s a [cocktail](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/category/recipes/drinks/), in which case I think mint is perfect, did you see these [mojitos](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/white-tea-and-muddled-basil-mojito/ \"White Tea and Muddled Basil Mojito.\")? Mint used in savory dishes however, well it throws me off. Until today. Cooking mint in olive oil really mellows out the flavor and makes the mint much less pungent. I found it to be perfect when stirred into a yogurt based goddess sauce. Which I am now spooning over everything, so addicting. Roasted salmon and potatoes are especially delicious.\n\nOnce the sauce is made and the chicken is grilled, it’s assembly time! I used orzo pasta as my grain, but feel free to use quinoa, couscous, or brown rice. Any would be great.\n\nI then layered in some roasted red peppers, avocado, cucumbers, olives, and even some arugula. Lots of veggies… and a good amount of feta cheese too.\n\nSuper pretty, on the (very) healthy side, and so very delicious.\n\n![side angled photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and fork in bowl ](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-4-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nThe added bonus about this recipe is that it’s so great for weekday meal prep. I recommend making this on a Sunday or Monday night and doubling the recipe. Then simply use the leftovers to make lunch or dinner bowls to enjoy throughout the week!\n\nCook everything at once…get multiple meals…love that!\n\nSo excited to be sharing this recipe with you guys.

    "markdown": "# Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad - Crowded Kitchen\nThis summery salad makes the most of fresh produce with an arugula base, fresh blackberries, blueberries, cucumber, avocado, hazelnuts, feta and a lime mint vinaigrette.\n\nIf you haven't tried putting berries in a salad before, you're really missing out. They add pops of texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Blackberries and blueberries pair particularly well with refreshing cucumbers, creamy avocado and zesty arugula.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad on a white platter](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-5.jpg)\n\nThis is the perfect salad to enjoy all summer long because it's easy to make, packed with summer fruit, and is super refreshing on a hot day.\n\nYou can also add a grilled protein (tofu, chicken or shrimp), beans (white beans or chickpeas) or a grain (quinoa, wild rice) for a more filling meal.\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad](#blackberry-avocado-and-arugula-salad)\n*   [How to make this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad](#how-to-make-this-blackberry-avocado-and-arugula-salad)\n*   [Substitutions and Variations](#substitutions-and-variations)\n*   [What to Serve with this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad:](#what-to-serve-with-this-blackberry-avocado-and-arugula-salad)\n*   [Storage](#storage)\n*   [Tips and FAQ](#tips-and-faq)\n*   [Top tip](#top-tip)\n*   [More summer salad recipes](#more-summer-salad-recipes)\n*   [📖 Recipe](#%f0%9f%93%96-recipe)\n*   [💬 Reviews](#comments)\n\n![overhead view of ingredients for summer salad](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-3.jpg)\n\n### For the salad:\n\n*   **Arugula**: baby arugula is the perfect choice for this salad.\n*   **Blackberries and Blueberries:** use both, or one or the other.\n*   **Cucumber**: we used mini cucumbers, which are super crunchy, and thinly sliced them into rounds. You can also make ribbons with a peeler.\n*   **Avocado**: the riper, the better! We sliced them in this salad, but you can also dice them to distribute them better.\n*   **Feta**: Any kind will work in this recipe! You can also use vegan feta to keep this recipe dairy free.\n*   **Hazelnuts**: chopped, toasted or un-toasted.\n\n### For the lime mint vinaigrette:\n\n*   **Olive oil:** Extra virgin will have the best flavor.\n*   **Lime juice:** be sure to use freshly squeezed.\n*   **Mint:** We used fresh, not dried mint in this recipe.\n*   **Salt and pepper:** Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper for seasoniong.\n*   **Sweetener**: you can use maple syrup, agave, or honey.\n\n![close up view of blackberry avocado arugula salad on a white platter](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-8.jpg)\n\nHow to make this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's so easy, you don't even really need instructions, but here they are:\n\n**STEP 1**: Whisk together all the ingredients for the vinaigrette.\n\n**STEP 2**: Add all of the ingredients to a bowl, pour vinaigrette over, and toss. Enjoy!\n\nSubstitutions and Variations\n----------------------------\n\n**Arugula:** Feel free to substitute with spinach, baby kale, or another leafy green.\n\n**Blackberries and blueberries** can be swapped with strawberries, raspberries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, or just about any other summer fruit.\n\n**Not a fan of hazelnuts?** Try swapping with pine nuts, pistachios or pecans.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad in blue bowl](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-13.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**To turn this blackberry avocado arugula salad into a meal**: add a protein and/or grain. Cooked quinoa or wild rice both make fantastic additions.\n\nI also love adding white beans for a bit of extra plant-based protein. I let them marinade in a few tablespoons of the vinaigrette to soak up extra flavor. You could also top with grilled tofu, or chicken, shrimp or steak.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad in blue bowl](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-10.jpg)\n\nStorage\n-------\n\nYou can make this salad and the dressing ahead of time, just make sure to keep them separate if you are storing for longer than a day or two, or else the salad will be too soggy.\n\nOnce dressed, this salad can be kept in an airtight container but should be eaten the next day.\n\nTips and FAQ\n------------\n\nTop tip\n-------\n\nCutting everything into similarly-sized pieces will make this salad easier to toss, and easier to eat.\n\n**Can I use gorgonzola instead of feta?  \n**\n\nAbsolutely! Since not everyone is used to eating feta, gorgonzola or tiny mozzarella balls can be substituted in.\n\nMore summer salad recipes\n-------------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad with Pomegranate and Candied Pecans\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprout-salad-2/)\n*   [\n    \n    Citrus Burrata Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/citrus-burrata-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    White Bean Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/white-bean-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Greek Chickpea Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/greek-chickpea-salad/)\n\n### **Tried this recipe?**\n\n**Please leave a star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating below** and/or a review in the comments section further down the page.

How do you feel? I was a little suspicious back in the day, but if I give the kale a good massage and add a lot of different toppings, I can now get pretty excited about them. If you’re not into kale salads yet, let me see if I can sell you: we’re adding juicy peaches and blueberries, creamy goat cheese, and perfectly salty-sweet candied pecans.\n\nCANDIED PECANS! Sorry to shout, but they’re so good, and they’re super easy and quick to make on the stovetop in less than ten minutes. No fuss, no oven. And you may want to make a double batch, because it’s hard to stop snacking on them. I ate a lot of mine before the salad even got dressed!\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8777/28089678120_7875bc7005_o.jpg)\n\nIn other news, I have a serious peach problem. Last summer, we got down to Chattanooga at the end of peach session, right after [**The Peach Truck**](https://thepeachtruck.com/) had left town. I was so mad I had missed out. All year I waited and checked the schedule. And when they came to East Ridge a little over a week ago, I was there. I bought a [**25-pound box of peaches**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHnJEUdjlqw/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk) and a one-pound bag of pecans.\n\nSince then, it’s been all peaches all the time. In addition to eating an embarrassing number of them out of hand, juice dripping everywhere, I’ve made a [**peach dutch baby**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHuI8GPjCl0/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk), [**peach margaritas**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH0nlumjGdT/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk) (I shared the full recipe [**on Insta**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH0nlumjGdT/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk)–they’re so good!), peach muffins, and peach ice cream.\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8834/27756526903_ab5be3a9af_o.jpg)\n\nI have a few more peaches stashed in the fridge, and finally got around to a savory application: this summer kale salad. It’s pretty much an all-local salad because the kale is from my [**Big Sycamore Farm**](http://www.bigsycamorefarm.com/) CSA and the peaches and pecans are from Georgia (I live in TN but I’m just a few minutes from the GA border).\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8845/27756526603_e2a4a990ff_o.jpg)\n\nI picked the blueberries this weekend up at my friend [**Lindsey**](https://lindseylowephoto.wordpress.com/)‘s family’s place on [**Lookout Mountain**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH8aiM0DGBp/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk), and they gave me this amazing goat cheese they made themselves with milk from their own goats. I’m pretty sure I live in the best, most delicious place on earth!\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8608/28376099415_ab92db2430_o.jpg)\n\nThis summer kale salad is so easy and so fast, and you’ll feel a wonderfully healthy glow after eating it. Happy summer!  \n\nInstructions\n------------\n\n1.  To make the candied pecans, heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the pecan halves, maple syrup, smoked paprika, and a couple of pinches of sea salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until the pecans are coated in a sticky glaze and no liquid remains in the pan, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pecans to a parchment-lined plate and spread them out in a single layer to cool.\n2.  Mix all the dressing ingredients with a fork in a large bowl. Add the kale leaves, toss to coat them with the dressing, and massage them by hand until reduced in volume, darker green, and tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the kale to a platter or divide it between individual serving plates. Top with the peach slices, blueberries, crumbled goat cheese, and candied pecans.\n\n###### Nutrition Information:\n\nYield: 4 Serving Size: 1 small serving  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 372Total Fat: 31gSaturated Fat: 7gTrans Fat: 0gUnsaturated Fat: 23gCholesterol: 14mgSodium: 127mgCarbohydrates: 21gFiber: 6gSugar: 10gProtein: 8g\n\n_The nutrition label provided is an estimate for informational purposes only and may not be accurate.

This sauce-soaked, herb-loaded wonder is exactly the kind of chicken I like.\n\n![Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken and rice with bite on fork.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-5.jpg)\n\nIt’s the time of year when I start to build my meal plans around getting outdoors as much as possible. I know what’s coming (WINTER) and I know how much I will be outside (HARDLY AT ALL) so I’m doing my best to really lean into those summer flavors and the kinds of meals that naturally bring you outside into the sun. And if those meals can put loads of fresh summer herbs to good use, double win.\n\nFor that reason this recipe serves two purposes:\n\n*   Getting you outside into the sun / fresh air to boost the mood a bit.\n*   Giving you the foundation for all good things: that zingy, salty, herb-loaded coconut lime sauce.\n\n![Coconut lime sauce in a food processor.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-1.jpg)\n\nCoconut milk, lime juice, lime zest, fish sauce, cilantro mint garlic oh my. This. Sauce. Is. So. Good.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that between recipe development, photos, and video, the three people working on this recipe (working out of three separate locations) each ended up with slightly different looking sauces. One thin, one medium, one thick.\n\nThe lesson: coconut milk can vary greatly from can to can and brand to brand, and how much lime sauce you add (and whether you measure or just squeeze) can also impact the final coconut lime sauce texture. I’d recommend just starting with what’s written and then adjust as needed.\n\n![Grilling chicken on a grill.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-2.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the day, chicken and rice never fails, but it EXTRA never fails us when it’s serves as a blank canvas to holds all the flavors of that cool, creamy sauce.\n\nA little char on the chicken, a fresh squeeze of lime, hot sticky rice, and a heavy dousing of puckery coconut lime sauce. It’s creamy and summery, bright and fresh, and deeply filling and satisfying.\n\nBring it on.\n\n![Coconut Lime Grilled chicken with rice on a plate.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-4.jpg)\n\nCheck Out Our Video For How To Make Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Click here to see the step-by-step web story instructions for this recipe!](https://pinchofyum.com/web-stories/coconut-lime-grilled-chicken)\n\n_The coconut lime sauce (and the crown jewel!) of this recipe was inspired by the sauce in [this Forbidden Rice salad recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/37302-forbidden-rice-salad-with-thai-coconut-lime-dressing) from Food52.

Chicken: Pour about half of the sauce over the chicken and allow to marinade for 30 minutes. _(This 30 minute wait time is a good time to make some rice!)_\n    \n3.

There can be so much variance between brands and even just from can to can, which you can see between our Instagram story videos, our photos, and our step by step videos. The good news is that regardless of texture, the sauce tastes \\*delicious.\\* And you can always boost the creaminess by adding more of the top / solid part of the coconut milk into the sauce.\n\n**Vegetarian / Vegan:** Sub 1-2 tablespoons soy sauce for fish sauce, and serve on pan-fried tofu!\n\n*   Prep Time: 20 minutes\n*   Cook Time: 20 minutes\n*   Category: Dinner\n*   Method: Grilling\n*   Cuisine: Thai-Inspired\n\nKeywords: grilled chicken, grilling recipe, grilled chicken thighs, coconut sauce, coconut chicken, healthy summer dinner, rice bowls\n\n* * *\n\nOne More Thing!\n---------------\n\nThis recipe is part of our collection of **[delicious rice recipes](https://pinchofyum.com/delicious-rice-recipes)**.

[This is olive oil](https://amzn.to/3hwcVGc) is generally considered the gold standard for affordable but excellent.  \n**Parmesan:** Freshly grated parmesan is preferred here because it melts and browns extremely nicely, but the bagged pre-shredded stuff works just fine.  \n**Salt & pepper:** You don’t really need more seasoning than a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, but if you’d like to experiment with flavors, try adding a little garlic powder or Italian seasoning.\n\n![Parmesan being sprinkled on zucchini slices before baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo.jpg)\n\nHow to Make the Best Baked Parmesan Zucchini (Tips and Tricks)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Be strategic about how you slice your zucchini:** Prefer softer zucchini? Slice it into thinner rounds, around 1/4-inch thick. Like your baked zucchini on the firmer side? Cut it thicker, closer to 1/2-inch.  \n**Don’t skip the broiler:** The final step in this recipe after roasting your zucchini is to switch on the broiler and broil the rounds for just a couple minutes. This makes the cheese extra toasty and delicious. But keep a close eye on your zucchini while the broiler is going. Food under the broiler can burn very quickly, so you never want to leave your broiler unattended.\n\n![Collage photo of parmesan zucchini before and after baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-picture.jpg)\n\n### What to Serve With Cheesy Roasted Zucchini?\n\nThese bites are great alongside almost anything, particularly simple lunch sandwiches or:\n\n*   [Tomato Soup](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-tomato-soup-recipe-for-two/)\n*   [Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwiches](https://bakingmischief.com/pesto-grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Sausage Pasta](https://bakingmischief.com/creamy-sausage-pasta/)\n*   [Buttered Noodles](https://bakingmischief.com/buttered-noodles/)\n\n**Bonus Tip:** _If you have leftover [Pizza Sauce](https://bakingmischief.com/best-homemade-pizza-sauce/) or marinara sauce in your fridge, serve these as a snack and use them for dipping. You can even add chopped  pepperoni if you have it (layer it under the parmesan before baking)._ \n\n![Overhead photo of baked parmesan zucchini on a plate.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo-overhead.jpg)\n\n### More Easy Vegetable Sides\n\n*   [Roasted Zucchini](https://bakingmischief.com/roasted-zucchini/)\n*   [Butter and Garlic Green Beans](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-roasted-green-beans/)\n*   [Broccoli in the Oven](https://bakingmischief.com/broccoli-in-the-oven/)\n*   [Corn on the Cob in the Microwave](https://bakingmischief.com/microwave-corn-on-the-cob/)\n\n![Close up photo of baked parmesan zucchini on a plate.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-image-square-2-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 2 medium zucchini sliced into 1/4 to 1/2-inch rounds\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper\n*   ▢ 1 cup freshly grated parmesan pre-shredded is also fine\n\n*   Preheat oven to 450°F and line a broil-safe baking sheet with foil (optional for easier clean up).\n    \n*   Place zucchini slices on baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.

I have a batch of cooked quinoa in my fridge at all times and use it in meatless tacos, enchiladas, and salads. It's a healthy protein source and combined with beans and vegetables makes for a delicious and filling dish.\n\nThis Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad is a family favorite right now! It's simple to make and I can store it in individual containers for a healthy lunch throughout the week or as a side dish to grilled chicken. It's wonderful in lettuce cups or tossed with chopped kale too!\n\nIngredients:\n------------\n\n![sweet potatoes, corn, black beans, red onion and quinoa in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-1.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\n*   **sweet potatoes** - The star of this recipe! I cut the potatoes into chunks, toss them with oil and spices, and roast them.\n*   **quinoa** - You can use my recipe for cooking [quinoa in the Instant Pot](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/) (it takes only 1 minute of cooking time!!) or make it on the stove.\n*   **black beans** - You will need one can or 1 and ½ cups of home-cooked beans.\n*   **whole kernel corn** - You will need one can. Drain the water and rinse the corn before adding to the salad. Fresh is great too and can be roasted along with the potatoes! I do not like frozen and thawed-out corn in this salad\n*   **onion** - I prefer red onion for salads. You can use sweet or yellow, whatever you prefer.\n*   **olive oil** - It's a base for the dressing. Use avocado oil, if you prefer.\n*   **lime juice** - Freshly squeezed juice is best here.\n*   **spices** - cumin, paprika, salt, pepper\n*   **garlic** - I prefer fresh, minced garlic. Use garlic powder if you are in a pinch.\n*   **Tajin seasoning** - This ingredient is not necessary but definitely recommended. It is made with ground dried chile peppers, dehydrated lime, and sea salt.\n\nThis healthy and filling salad is very easy to make. It's perfect for meal prep lunch or dinners, when you want something filling but healthy. Here is how to make it:\n\n*   Start with roasting sweet potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, and cumin. They will have a delicious Mexican flair!\n*   Add one can of rinsed and drained black beans, one can of drained whole kernel corn, chopped red onion, and 2 cups of [cooked quinoa](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/).\n*   The dressing is as simple as the salad! Whisk together olive oil, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, and Tajin seasoning. Pour over salad and toss together.\n\n![roasted sweet potato salad in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-5.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHow to roast sweet potatoes for this salad?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRoasting sweet potatoes for a salad or as a simple side dish to your meal prep dishes is very easy. Simply peel potatoes and cut them into cubes, no bigger than ½\". Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and ground cumin. Roast at 400 degrees F for 20 to 23 minutes. Use right away or cool and add to your salad. You can also store them in a container with a lid in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n\nThe dressing:\n-------------\n\nI have plenty of salad recipes with creamy dressings, either mayo-based or healthier with sour cream. For this sweet potato salad, I decided to use a simple olive oil vinaigrette that perfectly complements the potatoes, beans, and quinoa. Mix 4 to 5 tablespoons of olive oil with lime juice, salt, cumin, paprika, minced garlic, and tajin seasoning. The last one is optional but I love it in this dressing and even add a little more sprinkled over each serving.\n\n![sweet potato quinoa salad in two bowls with lime wedges](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-4.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHelpful Tips!\n-------------\n\n*   I love this salad with slightly warm quinoa and warm roasted potatoes but it is absolutely delicious chilled in the fridge and can be divided into serving containers.\n*   If using fresh corn, add it to roasting potatoes. It will give it an even more delicious flavor.\n*   If you don't like raw red onion, skip it. Use a sweet one, if you prefer.\n*   To make the salad ahead, you can keep the dressing separate in a bottle and toss it with all the ingredients before serving.\n\nMore salad recipes:\n-------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Black Bean Taco Salad Recipe\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/black-bean-taco-salad-recipe/)\n*   [\n    \n    Chickpea Quinoa Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/chickpea-quinoa-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Fresh Corn Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/fresh-corn-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Easy Broccoli Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/quick-and-easy-broccoli-salad-recipe/)\n\n[![](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pin-it-button.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/59883870031914544/)\n\n__If you like this recipe and make it,_ **_let me know in the comments_** _below!

Fall comfort food at it’s best!\n\nwhy these pumpkin ravioli are the BEST\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   Homemade pumpkin ravioli are easy and fun to make plus they are super impressive and .. you know.. there’s all that street cred 🙂\n*   Tender pumpkin ravioli simmered in sage butter topped off with apple bites and toasted pecans. So much savoy goodness on one plate!\n*   Easy to make double batches of pumpkin ravioli so you have plenty in the freezer for a quick meal or to share with friends.\n\nTo make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, you will need:\n\n*   All purpose flour\n*   Eggs\n*   Olive oil\n*   Ricotta cheese\n*   Pumpkin puree\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Seasonings\n*   Butter\n*   Fresh sage leaves\n*   Apple\n*   Apple cider vinegar\n*   Walnuts\n\n**how do you make pumpkin ravioli?**\n------------------------------------\n\nEasy! To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-e1541953546118.jpg)\n\nThen roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-e1541953605651.jpg)\n\nUsing

Easier to make than you might think, these homemade pumpkin ravioli are tender and full of pumpkin flavor. Made with pumpkin puree, ricotta cheese, fall seasonings and an easy ravioli dough recipe, these pumpkin ravioli are then simmered in a rich sage butter and topped with apples and walnuts.\n\n#### Ravioli Dough\n\n*   3 cups all purpose flour\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   3 large eggs\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   2 teaspoons water\n*   extra flour for rolling\n\n#### Pumpkin Ravoili Filling\n\n*   1 cup ricotta cheese\n*   3/4 cup pumpkin puree\n*   1/3 cup parmesan cheese grated\n*   1 large egg\n*   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n*   1/2 teaspoon allspice\n*   2 tablespoons brown sugar\n*   1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   1/4 teaspoon pepper\n*   non-stick cooking spray\n\n#### Apple Sage Butter\n\n*   1/2 cup butter\n*   16-18 fresh sage leaves chopped or ripped\n*   1 apple - gala or honeycrisp peeled, cored, diced\n*   1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n*   1/4 cup walnuts chopped\n\n#### To Make the Ravioli Dough\n\n*   Easy! To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough. On your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine.  Now, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.  Next, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano. \n    \n*   Now, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture and once the dough starts to look like ... dough .... start kneeding it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. Then form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.  \n    \n\n#### To Make the Pumpkin Ravioli Filling\n\n*   After that hour has passed and you are ready to make your pumpkin ravioli, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. Add in the parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside. \n    \n\n#### To Make the Pumpkin Ravioli\n\n*   On your countertop or a large cutting board, unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide. \n    \n*   At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray. Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well. Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells. Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli. Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed. Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray. The ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n    \n*   Add your fresh ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n    \n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don't want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don't forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can't emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here!

I began by oven roasting carrots with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt and pepper.\n\n![hand adding salt to carrots on a sheet pan.](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/glazed-roasted-carrots-704x1024.jpg)\n\n2.  While the carrots roasted, in another pan I sautéd pecans with a bit more butter, brown sugar, maple syrup (for that great fall flavor) and a sprinkle of flaked sea salt.\n\n![carrots on a sheet pan with seasonings and butter. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/roasted-glazed-carrots-683x1024.jpg)\n\n![candied pecans in a bowl. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/candied-pecans-1024x656.jpg)\n\n3.  Once the carrots were fork tender, they came out of the oven. I plated them and sprinkled them with goat cheese crumbles and the candied pecans I had just made.\n4.  For more color and flavor, I finished things off with fresh thyme leaves.\n\n![roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese served on a platter. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Glazed-Roasted-Carrots-with-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-684x1024.jpg)\n\nThat’s it!

The sprinkle of thyme is the perfect finishing touch and a compliment to the season.\n\n![roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese side dish on a plate. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Roasted-Carrots-Candied-Pecans-Goat-Cheese-recipe-1024x644.jpg)\n\nRecipe Variations\n-----------------\n\nEnjoy this recipe and want to try a different variation? You’ve got it! Here are a few ideas to get your started.\n\n*   **Spicy Kick**: For those who like a bit of heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a drizzle of chili oil over the roasted carrots before serving.\n*   **Vegan Twist**: Swap the goat cheese for vegan feta or cashew-based cheese. For the candied pecans, use coconut oil instead of butter.\n*   **Nut Alternatives**: If pecans aren’t your thing or you’re just looking to mix things up, try candied walnuts or almonds instead.\n*   **Roasted Veggie Medley**: Introduce other root veggies to the party. Parsnips, beets, or sweet potatoes can be roasted alongside the carrots for a vibrant and varied dish.\n*   **Citrusy Fresh**: Add a zesty twist with a sprinkle of orange or lemon zest over the roasted carrots. The citrus notes can provide a refreshing contrast to the sweet and savory components.\n*   **Cheese Variations**: If goat cheese isn’t up your alley, try shaved Parmesan, crumbled feta, or even chunks of creamy brie. Each cheese brings its own unique flavor to the dish.\n\n![gold tongs taking a serving of roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Glazed-Carrots-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-recipe-756x1024.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Can I use baby carrots instead of regular carrots?\n\nTotally! Baby carrots are a great substitute. They might roast a tad quicker, so just keep an eye on them. That golden-brown caramelization is what we’re aiming for!\n\n### I’m out of maple syrup, any alternatives?\n\nNo sweat, friend! Honey works wonders as a substitute. You could also use agave nectar or even a touch of molasses for a deeper flavor.\n\n### Not a fan of goat cheese, what else can I use?\n\nThat’s the beauty of cooking – make it your own! Feta cheese or even blue cheese can offer a similar tangy kick. Or if you prefer something creamier, a sprinkle of fresh Parmesan or ricotta could be delish!\n\n### How long do these roasted carrots keep?\n\nThese babies taste best straight out of the oven. But if you do have leftovers, pop them in an airtight container and refrigerate. They’ll be good for 2-3 days. Just give them a little reheat before serving!\n\n### Can I prep the candied pecans ahead of time?\n\nAbsolutely! Make those pecans in advance and store them in an airtight container at room temperature. It’s a lifesaver, especially if you’re prepping for a big meal or gathering.\n\n### What other herbs can I use besides thyme?\n\n  \nRosemary is a great alternative with its aromatic and woody essence. Or even a sprinkle of parsley for some fresh vibes. Don’t be afraid to play around and find what tingles your taste buds!\n\nAs you have probably noticed, something sweet can be a nice complement to a savory meal. This is why people often serve something like candied yams or sweet butternut squash at Thanksgiving.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dish that’s a bit different, give these carrots a try. They are simple to make, and the flavor combination is on point.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\n![fork taking a bite of roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese.](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Roasted-Carrots-Candied-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-662x1024.jpg)\n\nMore Holiday Side You’ll Love\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Mashed Butternut Squash](https://inspiredbycharm.com/mashed-butternut-squash/)\n*   [Waldorf Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/waldorf-salad/)\n*   [Roasted Brussels Spouts Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/roasted-balsamic-brussels-sprouts/)\n*   [Cheesy Cauliflower Gratin](https://inspiredbycharm.com/cheesy-cauliflower-gratin/)\n*   [Broccolini Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/broccolini-salad/)\n\nI truly hope you give these roasted carrots a try – they’re a game-changer.

If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

It remains one of the most popular salads on _The Forked Spoon_, especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nEvery year around November and December I remember this salad recipe and can’t get enough of it.\n\nMade with sweet pears, tangy feta cheese, crunchy pomegranates, and mellow walnuts – this nutritious salad is what salad dreams are made of. **It is my favorite salad ever**.

For best results, serve immediately after tossing with salad dressing or vinaigrette.\n\n![Overhead photo of a salad bowl filled with spinach, sliced pears, feta cheese, walnuts, pomegranate arils, and green onion.](https://theforkedspoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Spinach-Pear-and-Feta-Salad-with-Walnuts-and-Pomegranate-Arils-4.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with this Spinach Salad\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis easy spinach and pear salad is one of my favorite last-minute lunch or dinner options when I’m too lazy to cook.

Well not until a berry dressing finally knocked my socks off, that is. There’s a sweet raspberry dressing at a local lunch spot here that has totally changed my mind about fruity dressings and holy cow I’ve been missing out!\n\nSince I suspect their berry dressing is laced with enough sugar to classify it as liquid candy, I figured I had two choices: embrace dessert salads and give up donuts in favor of sugar-laden greens \\*OR\\* make my own healthy berry salad dressing at home.\n\nObviously I chose the latter.\n\n_No way am I giving up donuts!_\n\nRaspberries don’t last long in this house, as my [pint-sized sidekick](https://peasandcrayons.com/chickpea), can clear out a carton in a sitting, so I decided to tackle the bucket of farm-fresh blueberries we picked the week prior.\n\nI blended a cup of berries into my go-to [balsamic dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2017/03/strawberry-steak-salad-with-homemade-balsamic-dressing.html) and had to talk myself down from polishing off the entire jar right then and there.

Once dressing is emulsified you're good to go!\n    \n*   Wash + dry your greens. \n    \n*   Combine with cucumber and blueberries, then toss with a drizzle or two of dressing. Add extra as desired.\n    \n*   Top with mandarin orange segments, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds and serve!\n    \n\nMaking this salad in advance? Go for it! Mix together everything minus the orange and dressing then combine when ready to serve!\n\nNOTE: This recipe makes a bottle's worth of dressing which will keep great in the fridge for future salads.

    "markdown": "# Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet | Greens & Chocolate\n**Butternut Squash Chicken Sausage and Kale Quinoa Skillet** is a stunning autumn dinner with **simple ingredients but BIG flavors**! \n\n![](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Butternut-Squash-Quinoa-Skillet-14.jpg.webp)\n\nOne of my favorite things about food blogging is when I come up with a recipe idea in my head and get to see it come to life in the kitchen.  While I don't always take the time to sit back and think \"hey!  that's pretty cool that I made that!\" I definitely did with this recipe.\n\nThis Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet was one of those recipe ideas that I just wasn't quite sure it was going to work out.  It was either going to be 'pretty good' but not blog-worthy, or 'REALLY FREAKING GOOD.'  Lucky for all of us, it was the latter!\n\nThe thing about a dish like this is that the flavors are so simple and uncomplicated, but work together perfectly.  From the sweet butternut squash (which is also delicious in this [Crunchy Honey Butternut Squash Casserole](https://greensnchocolate.com/crunchy-honey-butternut-squash-casserole/)!) and dried cherries to the smoky chicken sausage and tangy goat cheese - every bite is pure heaven!  Of course I couldn't help myself and added some kale, too.  I just love the stuff and my garden is still producing it, so I figured why not.  If you prefer spinach, chard, or another type of green, feel free to substitute!\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Ingredients](#ingredients)\n*   [Variations](#variations)\n*   [Recipe Step by Step Instructions](#recipe-step-by-step-instructions)\n*   [Recipe FAQs](#recipe-faqs)\n*   [Other Comfort Food Recipes to Consider](#other-comfort-food-recipes-to-consider)\n*   [Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet](#butternut-squash-chicken-sausage-and-kale-quinoa-skillet)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n![Ingredients in Butternut Squash Skillet including butternut squash, kale, quinoa, goat cheese, garlic, dried cherries, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, onion, and fresh sage. ](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Butternut-Squash-Quinoa-Skillet.jpg.webp)\n\n**Butternut Squash** \\- cubes of butternut squash are roasted and tossed into this quinoa dish.\n\n**Chicken Sausage** - I love using chicken sausage (Adell's is my favorite brand!) and in this dish I use apple chicken sausage.\n\n**Quinoa** - quinoa is a healthy grain that is a great source of fiber and protein. It's also the star in my [Mango Black Bean Quinoa Salad](https://greensnchocolate.com/mango-black-bean-quinoa-salad/).\n\n**Onion** - white or yellow onion both work in this recipe.\n\n**Garlic** - fresh garlic adds delicious flavor.\n\n**Fresh Sage** - I love adding fresh sage to fall dishes for an earthy flavor. I also love it in my [Garlic Herb Mayonnaise Roasted Turkey](https://greensnchocolate.com/garlic-herb-mayonnaise-roasted-turkey/) recipe!\n\n**Maple Syrup** - this is part of the very light sauce that adds some sweetness and warm flavor to the dish. It's not only used in sweet dishes like [Maple Muffins](https://greensnchocolate.com/maple-donut-muffins/)!\n\n**Dried Cherries** - cherries add a hint of sweetness and tartness. I love the texture they add, too.\n\n**Goat Cheese** - crumbles of creamy goat cheese make every bite a mouthful of flavor!\n\nSee recipe card for complete list of ingredients and quantities.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nThis recipe is absolutely delicious as is, but here are some variations.\n\n**Different greens** - If you prefer spinach, chard, or another type of green, you can easily swap out the kale.\n\n**Different squash** - You could use diced acorn squash, diced delicata squash, or diced sweet potato instead of butternut squash.\n\n**Different grain** - if you aren't a fan of quinoa or have something else on hand, feel free to swap it. Other ideas include wheat berries, brown rice, couscous, barley, and farro.\n\n**Different cheese** \\- you could use Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, or blue cheese instead of goat cheese.\n\n**Swap the fruit.** Instead of dried cherries, you can use dried cranberries or pomegranate arils. I think diced apples would also be delicious!\n\nRecipe Step by Step Instructions\n--------------------------------\n\n![](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blank-1200-x-600-52.png.webp)\n\n1.

Olive Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).  I generally use Olive Oil for roasting and EVOO for dressings.  EVOO has a lower smoke point and I find it generally has a nicer and lighter taste, which is why I save it for dressings.\n\n**Nuts:**  I almost always have almonds in my cupboard, and find they are the perfect versatile crunch in salads.  Having said that, so many nuts would work well in this recipe.  If you don't have almonds on hand (or just don't like them), try pine nuts, walnuts or pecans instead.\n\n**Dressing:**  I've made a simple honey lemon vinaigrette for the dressing.  If honey isn't your thing, you can substitute for maple syrup or brown rice / rice malt syrup OR simply omit altogether if you don't want a sweetener.\n\n![chopped sweet potato and onion on a baking tray](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad2.jpg)\n\n💭 CAN I MAKE THIS SALAD AHEAD?\n-------------------------------\n\nRoasted vegetable salads do take a little longer to prepare than those made with more traditional salad ingredients, but there are a few ways to plan ahead to cut down prep time on the day and make this an easy work lunch.\n\nYou can roast a few sweet potatoes at the start of the week and use these to make up the salad each day as you go.  This is a great option if you want to have this salad as a quick weeknight dinner.  It'll be on the table in 5 minutes.  Roasted sweet potato will last in the fridge in an airtight container for 5 days.\n\nOR you can prep the salad minus the dressing, nuts and avocado and portion out for a day or two.  Then when the time comes simply add in some chopped avocado and dressing.  I don't recommend prepping salads too far in advance, as I find the ingredients don't tend to hold up that well.  But prepping this for a work lunch the night before is absolutely fine.\n\n![sweet potato, avocado and feta salad in a white bowl](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad4.jpg)\n\n🥗 MORE SCRUMPTIOUS SALAD RECIPES:\n----------------------------------\n\n*   [Roast Pumpkin, Spinach and Feta Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/pumpkin-feta-salad/)\n*   [Middle Eastern Bean Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/bean-salad/)\n*   [Cabbage and Crunchy Noodle Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/cabbage-and-crunchy-noodle-salad/)\n*   [Crunchy Kale Salad with Lemon Tamari Dressing](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/crunchy-kale-salad-lemon-tamari-dressing/)\n*   [Roast Pumpkin and Chickpea Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/roast-pumpkin-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [35 Easy and Yummy Salad Recipes](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/yummy-salad-recipes/)\n*   OR see all [Salad Recipes](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/category/recipes/salads/)\n\nIf you’ve tried this **Roasted Sweet Potato, Avocado and Feta Salad** I’d love to hear how you enjoyed it!

The opinions and text are all mine._\n\nDoes the cold weather make you just crave comfort food?  I know it does that to me.  And although I have plenty of room on my meal plan for [warm soups](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/), [cheesy pasta](https://www.foxandbriar.com/one-pot-pasta-bake-sausage-wine/) and all other kinds of comfort food, sometimes I want to keep it healthier and focus on fruits and veggies.  As I shared before with my [Roasted Shrimp, Fennel and Grapefruit Kale Salad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/roasted-shrimp-fennel-and-grapefruit-kale-salad/), I like my cool weather salads to be bulked up with roasted veggies and grains.  Here I have kept the farro and kale, but added roasted delicata squash and pomegranate aerials for that sweet tart zing.  Once again, my local Fred Meyer came through for me by having all the ingredients I needed for this salad, including these gorgeous pomegranates.\n\n[Jump to recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/autumn-harvest-salad-with-pomegranates/#recipe)\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

Then it is all tossed together with a maple apple cider vinaigrette! #ad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Autmumn-Harvest-Salad-with-Pomegranates-4-of-17.jpg)\n\nHow to de-seed a pomegranate:\n-----------------------------\n\n1.  1.  This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

You’ve just invited friends and family to a cookout at your place next weekend, but now you’ve found yourself at a bit of a loss for what to feed them! Hamburgers and hotdogs? Been there, done that. The routine BBQ Chicken that always seems to get scorched on the outside while it’s undercooked on the inside. Umm…maybe not.\n\nHow about adding a surprising gourmet touch that will make you famous for your skills at the grill, but it’s so simple you won’t even break a sweat? Sound good? If so, our Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers are the perfect option!\n\nThese skewers are everything you’re looking for in a backyard-friendly grilling dish. Our recipe offers a blend of enticing flavors, clean eating ingredients, and an unexpected taste that will have your guests asking, “What’s in this?” Well, the answer is healthy flavor– and _a lot of it._ \n\n**What Ingredients Do I Need?**\n-------------------------------\n\n![These flavorful chipotle honey chicken skewers will be the star of your cookout!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-6-e1629296144774.jpg)\n\nFirst, you’ll need some chicken! We suggest using boneless, skinless chicken breasts for their low fat and high protein content. Then, whisk together some honey for natural sweetness, tomato paste and apple cider vinegar for a tangy bite, chipotle chili powder for some heat, and garlic for a rich, savory finish. Each ingredient is healthy, and when combined in a sauce, the flavors complement one another perfectly. Oh, and did we mention it’s EASY?\n\n**Making These Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![Grill up some chicken skewers instead of plain old hamburgers and hotdogs. ](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-5-e1629296192708.jpg)\n\nThe preparation process for these honey chipotle chicken skewers is incredibly simple. So simple, in fact, that they can be on the table in less than 30 minutes! Start by slicing your chicken breasts into very thin strips using your sharpest knife. Once all of the slices are ready, begin threading them, accordion-style, onto the wooden skewers that you’ve soaked in some water beforehand (so they don’t burn through). This recipe is for eight skewers, so you should aim to get about four ounces of uncooked chicken onto each one.\n\n[![](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Skinny-Ms-Graphics-Horizontal-728-x-450-px-2.png)](https://bundles.skinnyms.com/?utm_source=skinnyms&utm_medium=inpostbanner)\n\nSet your skewered chicken to the side while you make the chipotle honey sauce. Grab a small bowl and whisk together the honey, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, chipotle chili powder, chopped garlic, and optional salt. Spoon the sauce evenly over the skewers. Alternatively, you can make the sauce in advance and marinate your sliced chicken in it for 30 minutes or longer before threading the strips on your skewers. Either way, make sure to save some of the sauce for basting during the grilling process.\n\nYour uncooked chicken skewers can rest in the fridge (covered with plastic or foil) while you’re preparing your side dishes. That way, you can throw them on the grill right before dinner time so they’re fresh and hot off the grill! When you’re ready, add the skewers to a hot grill for 10 to 12 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. Throughout the grilling process, baste the chicken with sauce, turning the skewers every 2 to 3 minutes. This will ensure the chicken is evenly cooked.\n\nIf the rain clouds come out and you’re forced to move inside, away from the grill, you’ll be glad to know that this recipe can also be prepared in the oven. Preheat it to 400 degrees. Cook them for 16-18 minutes or until fully cooked, rotating and basting every 5 or 6 minutes. If you like a little crisp on your sauced chicken, turn the broiler on and broil them for a minute or two once they are cooked, but be careful not to burn!\n\n**What Side Dishes Go With These Chicken Skewers?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Our quick and easy southwest cucumber avocado salad is a must-make this Summer!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Quick-and-Easy-Southwest-Cucumber-Avocado-Salad-8-e1606794206790.jpg)](https://skinnyms.com/quick-and-easy-southwest-cucumber-avocado-salad/)\n\nOur honey chipotle chicken skewers will no doubt be the star of the dinner plate, but every star needs a supporting actor (or two!).

Either way, feel free to make the kick work for your tastebuds!\n\n### Tips For Choosing A Ripe Mango\n\nThe best way to [choose a ripe mango](https://www.mango.org/choose-a-mango/#:~:text=Squeeze%20the%20mango%20gently.,at%20all%20levels%20of%20ripeness%3F) is to lightly squeeze it. If it’s just a bit soft, then it’s ripe and ready to eat. If it’s firm, then it isn’t quite ready!\n\n### Slicing The Mango\n\nThe best way to slice a mango is to cut it into 4 sections, starting at the top/center of the mango, right next to the seed, and guiding your knife down the side of the seed. Once you have 4 sections, cut each mango into cubes or slices, making sure not to pierce through the skin. Use your thumb or finger to separate the skin from the flesh of the mango.\n\n### How To Cook Quinoa To Perfection\n\nIt’s all about the water-to-quinoa ratio and how you cook it. Perfectly fluffy quinoa can be achieved single every time with [these simple steps for cooking quinoa!](https://www.jaroflemons.com/how-to-cook-quinoa-perfectly-every-time/)\n\nMeal Prep This Mango Quinoa Salad\n---------------------------------\n\nTo meal prep this salad, prepare the quinoa and chop the veggies (except for the avocado). Layer the salad, keeping the quinoa and avocado separate. Add the seasoning according to the instructions below and squeeze lime juice over the entire salad. When ready to enjoy, add in the cooked quinoa and sliced avocado!\n\nAnother time-saving method?

But, if you’re a fan of a creamy pasta salad, or an ultra easy-to-make pasta salad that’s loaded with healthier goodness (plus bacon!), this avocado and bacon pasta salad is for you.\n\nOnce the garden tomatoes come into harvest, BLT sandwiches are a staple at our house. And the only thing that makes them even better is adding avocado for them to become BLATs. Bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato sandwiches that are now a BBQ pasta salad staple.\n\nSo when my daughter requested I make a pasta salad that included her beloved bacon in the BLT mix, avocado was an obvious addition to make.\n\n[![BLT pasta salad ingredients in glass bowl](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1.jpg)\n\nBLT Pasta Salad Ingredients\n---------------------------\n\nI’m sure you can already guess the key ingredients in this BLT pasta salad recipe, but I added in a few more veggies to add extra pops of flavor. Instead of lettuce, I used peppery arugula, which pairs beautifully with the ranch pasta salad dressing. And I prefer using cherry tomatoes in this BLT pasta salad because they’re so juicy and hold their shape nicely.\n\nThe other ingredients you’ll need for this potluck side dish are:\n\n*   Pasta\n*   Bacon\n*   Cherry tomatoes\n*   Arugula\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Greek yogurt\n*   Mayonnaise\n*   White vinegar\n*   Chives\n*   Parsley\n*   Garlic powder\n*   Salt and pepper\n\nThe pasta salad dressing is a little healthier, because I used Greek yogurt instead of full flavored mayonnaise and sour cream. But thanks to the fresh herbs it has a totally fresh and delicious flavor.\n\nAs with any cold pasta salad, taste the dressing after you’ve whisked it together to see if it needs more salt or pepper. It’s much easier to season the dressing before it’s been tossed with the pasta!\n\n[![container of greek yogurt next to sliced red onion on counter](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002.jpg)\n\nHow to Make BLT Pasta Salad\n---------------------------\n\nTo make this homemade pasta salad, you’ll first need to cook the pasta noodles according to the package’s instructions. I tend to undercook my pasta just a bit for pasta salads so it doesn’t turn to mush as it absorbs the salad dressing.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, dice the bacon and cook it until it reaches your desired level of crispness. Note that you won’t have to oil the pan before cooking the bacon in it as the bacon will release a good amount of fat as it cooks.\n\nOnce the pasta has cooled slightly and the bacon and veggies have been prepped, add everything to a large bowl and toss to combine.\n\nNext up is the dressing. This pasta salad dressing is so easy to make, and is an easier rendition of [my homemade Ranch dressing](https://www.foodiecrush.com/homemade-ranch-dressing-recipe/) for saucing this easy pasta salad. In a separate bowl, whisk together the homemade ranch dressing. Pour the dressing over the BLT pasta salad and gently stir to distribute it.\n\n[![Homemade Ranch Dressing Recipe | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)\n\nCan I Use Fat-Free Greek Yogurt?\n--------------------------------\n\nPersonally, I would steer clear of using fat-free yogurt in this homemade pasta salad. Fat-free yogurts are often loaded with additives to make up for their flavor, and have a tendency to separate. Stick to low-fat or whole milk plain Greek yogurt for this recipe.\n\nThe Best Pastas for Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nI like this pasta salad best with a short pasta noodle, and like in my [Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/)  I use my favorite shell noodle. But, there are quite a few other types you can try, like:\n\n*   Farfalle (bowtie or butterflies)\n*   Gemelli (twists)\n*   Fusilli (springs)\n*   Campanelle (flowers)\n*   Penne (tubes)\n*   Orichette (ears)\n\nAlways cook your pasta in water that’s been generously salted. I always prefer kosher salt to regular table or iodized salt because it’s not as harsh due to its larger, flakier crystals.\n\n[![BLT Pasta Salad with Avocado | foodiecrush.com #pasta #salad #BLT #bacon #tomato #avocado #recipes](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013.jpg)\n\nCan I Prep This Pasta Salad in Advance?\n---------------------------------------\n\nI actually prefer my pasta salads to be served chilled, so yes, you can definitely prep this bacon pasta salad in advance. Just note that the longer the bacon sits in the dressing, the less crisp it will be when you serve this pasta salad.\n\nWith that said, this BLT pasta salad will be fine if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to serving it. This will give the flavors time to come together.\n\nCan I Double This BLT Pasta Salad Recipe?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re making this pasta salad for a backyard BBQ or potluck party, you can easily double the recipe if you’ll be feeding a _lot_ of people. One pound of pasta makes a lot of pasta salad, and the salad as-is serves 12 or more, but will stretch further if you’re serving other salads or side dishes along with it.\n\n[![close up of avocado and bacon pasta salad](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009.jpg)\n\nTips for Making BLT Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you’re out of ingredients or out of time to make the easy homemade dressing, feel free to use a quality bottled ranch dressing instead.\n\nWe prefer using classic pork bacon to make this BLT pasta salad, but you’re welcome to use any type of bacon you’d like.\n\nOne final note: the sliced avocado will brown as it sits in this BLT pasta salad. Personally, I don’t mind eating brown avocado (it’s perfectly safe to eat!), but if that’s something you’re worried about you can wait to stir it in until just before you serve this homemade pasta salad.\n\nMore Pasta Salad Ideas to Try\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Classic Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/) (this one always gets raves)\n*   [Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto](https://www.foodiecrush.com/craving-5-recipes-for-creamy-macaroni-salad/ \"Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto\")\n*   [Easy Italian Spaghetti Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/easy-italian-spaghetti-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Creamy Tuscan Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/tuscan-pasta-salad/)\n*   [How to Make Classic Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-classic-macaroni-salad/) (because classics always win!)\n*   [Kale Caesar Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/kale-caesar-pasta-salad/ \"Kale Caesar Pasta Salad\")\n*   [Greek Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/greek-pasta-salad-cucumbers-artichoke-hearts/)\n\n**If you mak****e this recipe, please let me know!

Chicken tenderloins, baby carrots and gold potatoes are cooked to perfection in a homemade garlic butter sauce.\n\nIf you love easy chicken recipes, try my [slow cooker chicken stew](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-chicken-stew/) recipe and [slow cooker cranberry chicken](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-cranberry-chicken/) recipes.\n\n![chicken with potatoes and carrots in crockpot.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-5.jpg)\n\n \n\nWhy this recipe works\n---------------------\n\nThis recipe isn’t for the faint of heart, this is for my butter loving friends. A stick of butter flavors this meal, but the entire meal. I add garlic, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper to a stick of melted butter. I pour that garlic butter mixture over chicken, carrots, and wedges of Yukon gold potatoes.\n\nNot all slow cooker meals end up being complete meals; I usually have to make a starchy side or make a salad. With this recipe, all the main food groups are covered. The chicken is tender, and so are the veggies. My favorite thing about this meal is the potatoes. There is something about butter and potatoes together that just can’t be beaten. I hope you give this recipe a try! It’s hearty like a pot roast dinner, but with chicken instead. Have a great week. I’ll be back at the end of the week with another recipe.\n\nRecipe Ingredients\n------------------\n\n![Ingredients for garlic butter chicken and vegetables on table.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-ingredients-2.jpg)\n\n*   **Chicken tenderloins** – These cook up perfectly and soak up the garlic butter. You can use boneless skinless chicken breasts if that’s all you have.\n*   **Carrots** – Use one pound of baby carrots or one pound of carrots cut into 1 inch chunks.\n*   **Gold Potatoes** – You can use red or gold potatoes, but we LOVE gold potatoes in this recipe.\n*   **Garlic Butter Sauce** – Salted butter, fresh minced garlic, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper.\n\nStep-by-Step Directions\n-----------------------\n\n![4 steps on how to add chicken, vegetables and garlic butter sauce to slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-collage-1-1200x1200.jpg)\n\n**Step One** – In a small bowl, add the melted salted butter and add minced garlic, salt, pepper, dried thyme, and dried parsley.\n\n**Step Two** –   Place chicken tenders (or breasts) in the middle of the slow cooker. On one side of that place wedges of Yukon gold potatoes and on the other a bag of baby carrots.\n\n**Step Three** – Pour the garlic butter mixture over the chicken and veggies.\n\n**Step Four** – Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours. Serve and enjoy! Plenty of buttery sauce for everyone!\n\n![cooked garlic butter chicken in slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-2.jpg)\n\nVariations\n----------\n\n*   **Green beans** – Green beans cook up so well in the slow cooker, use them instead of the carrots for this garlic butter chicken recipe.\n*   **Easy Peasy** – Instead of making a garlic butter sauce. Use 2/3 cup of Italian dressing.\n*   **Lemon Chicken** – Add the juice of one large lemon to the garlic butter sauce. You can even add the zest of that lemon too.\n*   **Parmesan** – To make the flavor pop in this dish, sprinkle grated parmesan cheese on each individual serving.\n\n![over head shot of plate of chicken, potatoes and vegetables.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-3.jpg)\n\nRecipe FAQs\n-----------\n\n**Can I use olive oil instead of butter?**\n\nOlive oil can be used instead of butter if you are in pinch, though you won’t get as much flavor.\n\n**Can I use chicken broth instead of butter?**\n\nIf you are looking to make this a healthy meal you can use chicken broth instead of butter, or water and a chicken bouillon cube.\n\n**Can I use Italian Seasoning?**\n\nYes! You can use 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning instead of the parsley and thyme.  \n\n**Can I use chicken thighs?**\n\nYes, chicken thighs are a great choice for this recipe.

It’s ready in under 20 minutes from start to finish. That’s great, especially when you know you can keep this pasta salad in the refrigerator for up to 3 days! We used rotisserie chicken to make the pasta salad, but feel free to roast or grill chicken breasts on your own or use chicken leftovers in your fridge. Put all the ingredients together in a large salad bowl and make the vinaigrette-style dressing.\n\n![Chicken Pasta Salad recipe 2](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chicken-Pasta-Salad-recipe-2.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nWhat’s the Best Pasta for the Chicken Pasta Salad? \n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWe like a classic rotini pasta salad because rotini holds the dressing pretty well, but any sturdy pasta will work! Avoid spaghetti and long pasta such as tagliatelle. Rotini, bow tie, penne, and macaroni are all good alternatives for this **chicken pasta salad recipe**.\n\n![Pasta Salad](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pasta-Salad.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nWhy you’ll love this pasta salad recipe\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   This chicken pasta salad recipe is easy to make and requires minimal cooking, making it perfect for a quick and simple meal.\n*   Combining fresh vegetables, flavorful herbs, and protein-packed chicken creates a delicious and nutritious dish.\n*   The homemade dressing adds a burst of tangy and herby flavors that perfectly compliments the other ingredients, taking this chicken pasta salad to the next level. Plus, the dressing can be customized to suit individual tastes by adjusting the amount of vinegar or seasoning used. See below for more tips about the dressing!\n\n![chicken avocado salad](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chicken-avocado-salad.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nThe Dressing for the Pasta Salad\n--------------------------------\n\nThe dressing is an important part of this pasta salad recipe. Our pasta salad dressing has only five ingredients, including salt and pepper.\n\nTo make the pasta salad dressing, whisk white wine vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, Italian seasoning, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This dressing is pretty simple, but when mixed with pasta, chicken, tomato, avocado, and other ingredients, the flavor is amazing!\n\nTo customize your pasta salad dressing, add a tablespoon of Greek yogurt, or use apple cider vinegar for a milder taste.\n\n![chicken salad dressing recipe](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chicken-salad-dressing-recipe.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![pasta salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pasta-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![best salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n**How to make chicken pasta salad:**\n\n**1.** Add the shredded chicken, pasta, onion, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and basil in a large bowl.\n\n**2.** In a jar, combine the ingredients for the dressing: vinegar, Italian seasoning, Olive oil, salt and pepper.\n\n**3.** Drizzle your chicken pasta salad with the dressing. Toss gently until all the ingredients are combined. Serve the **chicken pasta salad** immediately, or chill for later. Enjoy! ❤️\n\n![Chicken Pasta Salad recipe 3](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chicken-Pasta-Salad-recipe-3.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nTips for the chicken pasta salad\n--------------------------------\n\nThis **chicken pasta salad** is healthy, perfect for busy nights, and makes a big enough batch so you can plan for work or school lunches. Since there’s no mayo it’s great for potlucks, picnics, and parties.\n\n*   Additional add-ins that go well with this salad would include chopped cucumber, crispy bacon, corn, olives, black beans…\n*   To keep the avocado from turning brown, coat the avocado in either lemon juice or lime juice. It will act as an antioxidant.\n*   Being a **cold chicken pasta salad** makes it perfect for summer, picnics or potlucks. You can make it up to a day in advance, leaving the avocado and tomato until you are ready to serve the chicken pasta salad to keep the ingredients as fresh as possible.\n\n### Can I grill chicken instead of using rotisserie chicken?\n\nYes, of course, you can **grill chicken for this salad**. Make sure to grill chicken breasts or pan-sear on medium-low heat, so chicken doesn’t burn while undercooked in the inside. When out of fresh chicken, we like to use a bag of frozen grilled organic chicken breasts that we heat up in a skillet and use for the salad.\n\n### How to Store the Chicken Pasta Salad?\n\nThis chicken pasta salad keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days if stored in an air-tight container. Don’t keep it for more than that because the avocado will turn brown. You may have to toss the chicken pasta salad leftovers to redistribute the dressing before serving. If you want to make it ahead of time, omit the avocado, you’ll add them at the very last minute.\n\n### What other readers say about this chicken pasta salad\n\n“This was so good and the perfect lunch. Changes: I added black olives, cucumber and matchstick carrots. I forgot to add the basil and it was fine without it.” – Maureen\n\n“Just made this chicken pasta salad for our dinner. Will definitely make it again. Perfect for summer. Added some fire roasted corn and served the dressing on the side with croutons.” – Nancy\n\n“Delicious! Husband loved it!

And with strawberry season here and gone so quickly, we must take advantage!\n\nHere in the Midwest, summertime is a constant reminder to truly take things in. To enjoy the days as they are. To accept both the hot (often humid here) weather and the thunderstorms. To take advantage of the long days and spend more time with one another. To get outside and enjoy nature and the blue skies before it gets cold and gray again.\n\nEven though the days are longer, these months do not last long, and I’m finding that summer teaches us to be more present.

Here, I’ve included the method used by restaurants to get that ideal, slightly dried-out rice without having to wait a day. The YouTube channel [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChineseCookingDemystified/) is one of my favorite places to go for all my Chinese culinary questions. The method that its hosts Steph and Chris use to par-boil then steam the rice is borderline miraculous in the results you get. The Delish kitchen team was floored at the consistent texture you get with the rice, and I for one will not be cooking my rice any other way going forward.  \n• **Oil:** Choose an oil with a high-smoke point, and don’t be afraid to use a lot of oil—this is fried rice after all.  \n• **Eggs**: I use 3 large eggs in this recipe. I prefer to have some white streaks in my eggs, so I barely beat them together.  \n• **Garlic:** I like my fried rice super garlicky, so I use 5 cloves. You can take it back if you want, but honestly, I don’t suggest it—the more garlic, the better.  \n• **Ginger:** About an inch of ginger, minced very small, goes with the garlic before adding in our veggies.  \n• **Scallions:** When chopping your scallions, separate the whites and the greens. The green we’ll use as a garnish, and the white we’ll cook with.  \n• **Soy Sauce:** The first thing you’ll notice about this recipe is that soy sauce is included. While to some, this might not be super-traditional in fried rice, a lot of American eaters (and Delish taste testers) prefer it! Because there is no meat or seafood in this fried rice, after some testing, I felt it added some extra body and umami to the rice that is totally delicious. I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce so you can control the salt amount.  \n• **Sugar:** I believe that all savory dishes should be finished off with a bit of sugar if there isn’t a natural source of sweetness in it. It helps to round out the dish and provide a more complex flavor.  \n• **White Pepper:** White pepper is underutilized outside of fancier kitchens, but it’s worth buying if you can. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite things about this recipe; at home, I’ll add even more. It’s earthy, and has less of a kick than black pepper.  \n• **MSG:** MSG adds the perfect sweet-salty boost to fried rice. It’s a widely misunderstood ingredient—checkout this article all about [MSG](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35119070/msg-monosodium-glutamate/) if you’re looking to learn more.  \n• **Peas:** I personally love peas in fried rice, and find it’s a common addition in many American versions. Don’t worry about using frozen peas, they won’t emit too much moisture to the rice.  \n• **Butter:** Using butter is a bit controversial, but it adds a wonderful richness, and a little bit goes a long way. If you really don’t want to use it, you can omit it.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nLeftover rice works perfectly for fried rice, so if you have some hanging out in your fridge, use it here. But, if you don’t have any, never fear: I’ve found a 2-step technique to make freshly cooked rice absolutely perfect for fried rice. The first step of making any rice dish is to adequately clean your rice. Some people like to do this in the pot they’re going to cook their rice in, but I like to use a mesh strainer. Rinse the rice—moving around the grains frequently—until the water comes out clean.\n\nOnce your rice is ready, you’re going to par-boil the rice for just a few minutes. This will help to jumpstart the cooking process, breaking down the outsides of the grains of rice.\n\nOnce you strain the rice, we’re ready to make an impromptu steamer with a pot and a strainer that fits inside of it. First, add some water to the bottom of the pot, then put the strainer filled with your rinsed rice in it. Next, you’re going to want to create some holes in the rice with chopsticks to allow steam to circulate.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9983579638752053xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter making your holes, cover the pot with tin foil; it doesn’t have to be totally snug, but it should be well-tented. Then, cover with the pot lid and let it steam. Steaming the rice is a gentler cooking process that keeps the grains pretty dry and adds less moisture to the rice, which is what we’re looking for.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, check on your rice: It should almost taste al-dente. What I mean by this is that it should be fully cooked through, but should taste drier than normal steamed rice. Once it’s ready, I like to spread my rice on a sheet pan. This is a bit of overkill, but it will help your rice to cool down more quickly (which means fried rice faster!).\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNow that our rice is ready, let’s focus on bringing everything together. A wok is the most traditional way to cook fried rice, and it does work especially well. The movement and centralized heat are very helpful, and its size holds a large amount of rice . But if you don’t have one, don’t let that stop you: I’ve made incredible fried rice in a cast iron skillet.\n\nBarely beat the eggs together (if you prefer some whites in your egg) before adding to your wok. Once you add to the wok, move your eggs around quickly, pressing in with a spatula to make those perfect fried rice egg squiggles. Once they’re ready, take them out, and give your wok a quick wipe down. I recommend pre-cooking your eggs because if they sit in the fried rice for awhile, they will get overcooked.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNext, it’s time to add your oil. Don’t be shy here: This is fried rice after all, so add enough to coat all of the grains in the oil. Add in your ginger and garlic: This will help flavor the oil which will transfer to your entire dish. Then, add the green onions and cook until softened, flipping and stirring frequently to prevent any burning.\n\nAdd all of your rice, tossing and stirring it constantly (I mean it!). You should see the grains start to become individual, which is the tell-tale sign of a well-done fried rice. Once you see that the rice is separating, it’s time to add your seasonings and soy sauce.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nOnce your rice is perfectly seasoned and separated, it’s time to add in your eggs and peas.

Then, it’s just a matter of assembling the strawberry spinach salad and digging in!\n\nCan I Use Another Leafy Green?\n------------------------------\n\nI always have fresh spinach in the fridge, where it finds its way into everything from my [breakfast fritattas](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-and-mushroom-egg-white-frittata/), to my lightened up [sweet green smoothies](https://www.foodiecrush.com/immune-booster-sweet-green-smoothie/) and [spinach lasagna](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-lasagna-roll-ups/).  So it’s a natural base for this hearty salad, that works for lunch or dinner even.\n\nBut if you have kale, arugula, romaine, butter or even spring mix mingling in the crisper, by all means, use it up!\n\nCan I Use Another Berry?\n------------------------\n\nThe ying and yang of sweet strawberries with red onion and avocado is one of my favorite combos ever. However, you can always swap out raspberries or blueberries for the strawberries and instead of feta, give goat cheese a try. I have and likely will again.\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | #spinach #recipe #balsamic #chicken #healthy foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTips for Making Strawberry Spinach Salad\n----------------------------------------\n\n**I like to cook a few chicken breasts on Sunday or Monday** to eat during the week in salads like this. I’ve shared how to cook them on the stove top below, but if you’re ready to grill, [this technique](https://www.foodiecrush.com/the-best-grilled-chicken-breast-recipe-and-a-giveaway/) is always a grilled chicken success.\n\n**This balsamic tarragon dressing is my standard, go-to-all-the-time salad dressings.** I use white balsamic dressing because it’s a bit mellower and doesn’t dominate the flavor of the salad, instead letting all of the other flavors shine through.\n\n**The dressing does double duty as a chicken marinade too.** Remember that after marinating chicken to discard the marinade. You do NOT want to use it for the dressing after soaking in raw chicken.

We have spent it almost entirely doing wall prep (3 days!!) and painting (1 day) our guest bedroom and we were dead people walking at the end of yesterday. When we ventured out for dinner last night, we were so tired that we were barely able to keep our eyes open.\n\nIt was really hard work, but it paid off – the room already looks ten times better and it’s not even finished yet. We are nearly done with the ceiling and the walls (the 3rd and final coat of paint goes on tomorrow), but the skirting boards and the radiator will need to wait until our guests leave, as we don’t want to poison them with paint fumes. My brother and his partner are visiting us this Friday and, especially after the weekend we’ve had, we are really looking forward to spending some relaxing time with them. We have not seen each other for ages and they recently returned from some exciting travels, so we cannot wait to catch up and hear all they’ve been up to.\n\nWhile Duncan and myself are more into sweet kind of breakfasts, I know that my brother especially prefers a savoury brekkie. So I’ve been thinking about what I could make for him and this simple vegan breakfast bowl is what I came up with. It’s a dish that marries a lot of leftovers together and it isn’t worse for it.\n\nI used already cooked and cooled potatoes, which I pan-fried in a little olive oil. I charred some cherry toms under a hot grill until they split open and became jammy and delicious (beware as they stay dangerously hot for ages!!). I wilted some spinach that wasn’t fresh enough to put in a salad anymore and finally made vegan scrambled eggs from some silken tofu, flavoured with aromatics and magical black salt, which due to its high sulphur content, makes tofu taste like eggs.\n\nIt may sound very niche and fancy, but it’s a staple of Indian cuisine, so if you live in the UK, a well-stocked Indian-run corner store is a great place to get it. While it’s called black salt (or [kala namak](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak)), it is dusty pink when ground up fine, so keep your eyes open for that. This dish is filling, full of contrasting textures and flavours and super quick to put together. It will make an awesome savoury breakfast or brunch and I am hoping that it will make our non-vegan guests happy.\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl ingredients](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-ingredients.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl potatoes](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-potatoes.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl portion](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-portion-800x1200.jpg)\n\n*   olive oil\n*   a bunch of cherry tomatoes on the vine\n*   250 g / 9 oz cooked and cooled small potatoes, halved\n*   salt to taste\n*   black pepper, to taste\n*   100 g / 3.5 oz baby spinach\n*   1 large shallot, finely diced\n*   1 garlic clove, finely diced\n*   300 g / 10.5 oz silken firm tofu (I use [Clearspring](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/silken-tofu))\n*   ¼ tsp turmeric, adjust to taste\n*   ¼ tsp [black salt](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak) (has eggy taste), adjust to taste\n*   ½ ripe avocado, cut in half\n\nMETHOD\n\n1.  Brush tomatoes with a little oil (keeping them on the vine if you can) and place them on a small baking tray. Stick them under a grill / broiler for 5-10 minutes, until their skins burst and the tops char a little. Season and set aside.\n2.  Heat up 2 tsp of olive oil on a small frying pan. Place cold potatoes, cut side down on the hot oil and allow them to fry gently until nicely browned. Season with salt and pepper.\n3.  Place spinach on another pan with a splash of water. Allow the spinach to wilt using gentle heat. Move it around the pan with a pair of tongs. Season and lift wilted spinach out of the pan, draining any excess water away.\n4.  Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan (I reused the one I used to wilt the spinach) and fry diced shallot and garlic on a very gentle heat.\n5.  Once shallot is translucent and garlic fragrant (but not browned), add the drained tofu. Smash it a little with the back of a spoon. Season with turmeric, black salt (it will give it eggy taste) and pepper.\n6.  Divide all the elements (including the avocado) between two bowls and drizzle with extra olive oil if needed."

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/privacy-policy/).\n\nThis delicious grilled mozzarella sandwich is perfect to make when you want something fresh with a gourmet quality, but don’t want to go to a restaurant. **Homemade walnut pesto, fresh tomatoes and melted mozzarella** make every bite full of flavor. Be sure to make a double batch of the pesto so you can whip up a tasty sandwich later on in the week.\n\n![Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich made with walnut pesto, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-8.jpg)\n\nRECIPE VIDEO TUTORIAL\n---------------------\n\nHow to make grilled mozzarella sandwich – step by step\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n### To make the pesto\n\nPlace the **basil, garlic, walnuts and Parmesan cheese in the food processor;** season with salt and pepper, to taste, and blend. While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n\n![Collage showing how to make walnut pesto before and after blending in food processor](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-Collage1.jpg)\n\n### To assemble the sandwiches\n\nYou will need some **sourdough bread** sliced about ½ inch thick, **whole mozzarella cheese**, the **pesto** you just successfully whipped up, along with large **tomato slices and roasted red pepper**.\n\n![Ingredients to make the recipes: bread, pesto, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-3-640x427.jpg)\n\nNext, you’ll want to **spread the pesto** on four slices of the sourdough bread, and place two of the slices right on the panini maker with the pesto side up.\n\n![Spreading walnut pesto on the bread before assembling and grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-4-640x427.jpg)\n\nThe assembly all happens in the panini maker, [like this one](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) (or toaster oven or grill pan). Add the mozzarella cheese on right away, and give it a minute to settle in and start melting. Start piling the tomatoes and roasted red peppers (carefully).\n\n![Two open faced sandwiches in the panini topped with tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-5-640x427.jpg)\n\nAnd then, **close the sandwich with the remaining bread** (pesto side down) and close the panini maker. This is seriously the hardest part of the recipe. The type of bread you use and how high you stack the sandwich can really make or break the sandwich. You want to **lightly press on the sandwich** so we don’t end up with a pressed pile of cheesy bread (although I have done it and it is delicious still haha!)\n\n![Sandwich assembled in the panini before grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-6-640x427.jpg)\n\nYou’ll know it’s done when the bread is crispy and golden brown and the mozzarella cheese is melty. It’s a sandwich recipe that looks totally gourmet and tastes out of this world!\n\n![Sandwich after coming off the panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-7.jpg)\n\nTips for making grilled mozzarella sandwich\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Don’t have a panini maker?** [This panini maker](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) is great, or you can use a toaster oven to achieve the same result (minus those pretty grill lines). You can also use a grill pan or regular pan to make this sandwich recipe.\n2.  **Don’t have a food processor?** Just buy store-bought pesto! But really, if you can find a way to make your own pesto, it really takes this sandwich to another level.\n3.  Make sure you use the **freshest ingredients** you can for maximum flavor. That is especially true for the basil and the mozzarella cheese.\n4.  **Use thick sturdy sourdough bread** that is not airy on the inside to ensure the sandwich stays put when you press on it in the panini maker.\n\n![Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich made with walnut pesto, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-8.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Is a grilled mozzarella sandwich healthy?\n\nOne sandwich comes in at under 450 calories, so even though it’s not low in calories, it’s certainly **better for you than a lot of store bought sandwiches**. Making your own pesto is certainly a healthier option than buying store bought because there aren’t preservatives or milk or other unnecessary ingredients added. To make the sandwich lighter, you can use whole wheat bread which contains more fiber, and you can use a low fat mozzarella if you so wish.\n\n### How do you make homemade walnut pesto?\n\nPesto is so easy to make at home. We are all so used to buying the jarred stuff, but fresh is always better! Use a **good olive oil, super fresh basil leaves (or any greens really) and some nuts**. Add the dry ingredients to a food processor, and while they are combining, slowly pour in the olive oil. Easy! Be sure to make an extra batch and stir it into fresh pasta!\n\n![Mozzarella Grilled Sandwich stacked with basil on the side](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-9.jpg)\n\nFor more delicious sandwich recipes:\n------------------------------------\n\n*   [Turkey Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/turkey-panini/)\n*   [Roasted Vegetable Grilled Cheese Sandwich](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Pesto Chicken Avocado Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/pesto-chicken-avocado-panini/)\n*   [Cheesy Chicken & Broccoli Wraps](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/cheesy-chicken-broccoli-wraps/)\n\nI really hope you enjoy this grilled mozzarella sandwich recipe as much as we did!

While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n    \n*   Spread the pesto equally on the 4 slices of bread and place two slices of bread on the panini maker or in a toaster oven for 2 minutes.\n    \n*   Then place the mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers on top of two bread slices and allow the cheese to melt and the veggies to soften, keeping the panini maker open.\n    \n*   Once the cheese starts to melt, add the second slices on top to close the sandwiches, then close the panini maker for 2-3 minutes. Remove, slice in half and serve immediately\n    \n\n**Storage:** Leftover pesto should be covered and stored in the refrigerator, it will keep fresh for one week. I would not recommend storing the sandwich though for more than a couple hours. If you have sandwich leftovers, it’s best to reheat using a toaster oven or panini maker.\n\n**Make Ahead Tips:** You can make the pesto up to one week in advance and then use in the the grilled sandwich when you’re ready.\n\n**Substitutes:** For best results, follow the recipe as is. However here are some common substitutes that would work well in this recipe.\n\n*   _Instead whole mozzarella_, you can use shredded mozzarella. Although I think it creates a completely different flavor and texture to the sandwich.\n*   _Instead of walnuts_, you can use other nuts, like pine nuts, almonds or pecans, to make the pesto\n\n**Equipment**: I use the [Kitchen Aid 7-Cup Food processor](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KFP0718CU-7-Cup-Processor-Puree/dp/B07BVYPDJ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=30RV8LXKUP8I8&keywords=kitchenaid+7+cup+food+processor&qid=1552749952&s=gateway&sprefix=kitchen+aid+7+cup,aps,240&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=feelgoodfoodie-20&linkId=35c757d4f7499b6121fbed25a3cbd49d&language=en_US) [Kitchen Aid 11-Cup Food Processor](https://amzn.to/2Qe4KFo) to to make the pesto. It has a high and low pulse speed so you can make the pesto as smooth or chunky as you’d like. And it has a 3-in-1 wide mouth feed tube to make it easier to slowly add olive oil while the machine is running.\n\nIt’s so fun to make sandwiches in my panini maker. I have the [Cuisinart 5-in-1 Griddler](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-GR-4N-Griddler-Silver-Black/dp/B002YD99Y4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1542920577&sr=1-3&keywords=panini+press&linkCode=ll1&tag=feelgoodfoodie-20&linkId=e26e82b7b800340cdaa315d148d53165&language=en_US) – pretty much a magic appliance in my kitchen that does so much! If you don’t have a panini grill, you can use a skillet and cook the sandwich for 2 minutes per side, pressing down with a spatula as you cook.\n\nServing: 1g, Calories: 449kcal, Carbohydrates: 41g, Protein: 16g, Fat: 25g, Saturated Fat: 6g, Cholesterol: 24mg, Sodium: 742mg, Potassium: 302mg, Fiber: 2g, Sugar: 3g, Vitamin A: 960IU, Vitamin C: 16.1mg, Calcium: 224mg, Iron: 3mg\n\nNutrition information provided is an estimate.

    "markdown": "# Grilled chicken BLT salad - Simply Delicious\nJuicy grilled **chicken BLT salad** is everything you want from a salad and more. Crispy bacon, creamy avocado and punchy lemon-herb dressing all come together to make this salad recipe simply irresistible.\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad with avocado](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-3.jpg)\n\nIngredients needed\n------------------\n\n*   **Chicken.** I used boneless skinless chicken breasts but boneless chicken thighs will be delicious too. I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper.\n*   **Bacon.** I used streaky bacon.\n*   **Lettuce.** Use your favorite crisp lettuce. Romaine lettuce, Cos, etc.\n*   **Tomatoes.** Cherry tomatoes, baby tomatoes, baby plum tomatoes will all work.\n*   **Avocado.**\n*   **For the dressing:** Extra-virgin olive oil, dried oregano, fresh lemon juice, salt and black pepper.\n\nHow to make BLT salad\n---------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** Halve the chicken horizontally with a sharp knife then place in a medium bowl. Mix together the marinade ingredients and pour over the chicken. Toss to coat then allow to marinate for at least 20 minutes but up to 24 hours covered in the fridge.\n2.  **Cook the chicken and bacon:** Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium-high heat then cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. I prefer cooking the bacon in the air fryer. Alternatively bake the bacon in a hot oven until crisp or cooked to your preference.\n3.  **Assemble the salad:** Arrange lettuce on a large serving platter then top with ripe tomatoes, sliced avocado, crispy bacon and the sliced chicken. To make the dressing, combine olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and salt and pour over the salad before serving.\n\n### How to make grilled chicken for salad\n\nMake a quick marinade with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, herbs of your choice (rosemary, thyme and oregano are always a safe bet) and season generously with salt and pepper. Pour over boneless, skinless chicken breasts and allow to marinate while you heat the grill or grill pan. Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until cooked through and golden brown on both sides. The internal temperature should be 75**°**C or 165**°**F. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. You can also use **[pan fried chicken](https://simply-delicious-food.com/pan-fried-chicken-breast/)** for this recipe.\n\n### Why is it important to let meat rest after cooking?\n\nResting meat or chicken allows the juices to be redistributed throughout the meat instead of running out onto the cutting board. This is because the meat tenses up during cooking and allowing it to rest, literally allows the meat to relax and will result in juicier meat or chicken.\n\n![Grilled chicken on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-2.jpg)\n\nCan I make this ahead?\n----------------------\n\nThe chicken can be marinated for up to 24 hours in the fridge. Cooked chicken can be kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To prep the salad in advance, I would keep the dressing separate as it will cause the lettuce to wilt. Slice the avocado and dress the salad right before serving.\n\nWhat to serve with blt chicken salad\n------------------------------------\n\nThis salad is a fantastic gluten-free/keto meal on its own. If you want to add side dishes, a loaf of **[crusty bread](https://simply-delicious-food.com/easy-crusty-bread-recipe/)** is always delicious with salad.\n\n![Easy lemon-herb dressing on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-4.jpg)\n\n*   **[BBQ chicken salad with charred corn](https://simply-delicious-food.com/bbq-chicken-salad-with-charred-corn/)**\n*   [**Greek chicken salad**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/greek-chicken-salad/)\n*   [**Peri-Peri chicken salad with charred corn**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/peri-peri-chicken-salad/)\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blt-chicken-salad-3-2-266x266.jpg)\n\n#### For the grilled chicken\n\n*   4 chicken breasts boneless + skinless\n*   2 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   2 garlic cloves crushed\n*   1 tsp salt\n*   ½ tsp black pepper\n\n#### For the salad\n\n*   8 strips streaky bacon cooked to your preference\n*   lettuce\n*   baby tomatoes halved\n*   1 avocado sliced\n\n#### For the lemon-herb dressing\n\n*   3 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   salt and pepper to taste\n\n*   Combine all the marinade ingredients and mix well.

    "markdown": "# MIDDLE EASTERN KOFTA KEBABS - Parsley Thyme & Limoncello\nI am still exploring new flavor profiles and Middle Eastern foods seem to be exactly what my taste buds are screaming for. I’m loving how much flavor I find in every morsel I eat. One thing I have noticed is they add larger quantities of spices and herbs than I’m used to using. I’m always afraid of adding too much. This journey has shown me differently. Not only the quantity used but the combination of flavors. It’s SO good!\n\nNot only am I exploring foods from other countries but I’m looking for anything that can be put on the grill or smoker. It’s just downright “HOT” in the south. My kitchen heats up quickly so the logical solution is to cook as much outdoors as possible. This recipe works to satisfy both my longings.\n\nMix all ingredients together in a medium bowl. Form into golf ball-sized meatballs.

    "markdown": "# Peanut Chicken Lettuce Wraps - Chelsea's Messy Apron\n**_Peanut Chicken Lettuce Wraps_** _are an easy and healthy low-carb meal that can be ready in about 30 minutes. These wraps are filled with seasoned chicken, crisp veggies and herbs, crunchy peanuts, and a sweet peanut sauce._\n\nTry some other lettuce wrap recipes next. These [Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/vegetarian-lettuce-wraps/), [Taco Lettuce Wraps](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/taco-lettuce-wraps/), or [Beef Lettuce Wraps](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/beef-lettuce-wraps/) are all simple to make and lip-smacking delicious.\n\n ![Plate of peanut chicken lettuce wraps, featuring vibrant lettuce cups filled with savory chicken and peanut sauce.](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peanut-Chicken-Lettuce-Wraps-1.jpg)\n\nThese wraps are light and healthy, fresh-tasting, and brimming with so many great textures. From the crisp lettuce to the crunchy nuts on top and the smooth peanut sauce finishing everything off, you will love this meal!\n\nThese wraps are an easy meal to make for a quick weeknight dinner. The chicken only requires a few spices and a grill or grill pan (or George Foreman-style electric grill), there are only a few veggies to chop, and the peanut sauce is as easy as adding everything to a blender and pressing the start button.\n\nPeanut sauce\n------------\n\nBefore we get too far, I’ll say right up front that this peanut sauce is far from an authentic Asian sauce. It’s definitely more on the sweet side and perhaps is more of a peanut dressing. Either way, we’re obsessed with this sauce; it’s indulgent, rich, and a little tangy! The sauce is intentionally sweet to complement all the raw crunchy veggies. The flavor is milder than a lot of peanut sauces and complements the flavors in the chicken delightfully.\n\nAlthough the sauce is sweet by design, you can always tweak it to your preference and make it less sweet (by adding less honey). Alternatively, you can add more spice (increase cayenne pepper, add red pepper flakes, or add in some chili sauce). \n\nAnd the sauce is very easy to make. It’s as simple as putting the ingredients in a good blender (I like the [Blendtec® blender](https://amzn.to/2XmtxGW) for its quality and power) and letting it rip.\n\n ![Boneless, skinless chicken breast transformation: raw, sautéed, chopped, and served in the salad.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201205'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nChicken tips\n------------\n\n*   **Slice breasts in half before grilling**: Slice and/or pound your chicken breasts into evenly thick pieces before grilling. That way they’ll cook quicker and evenly. They’ll also be the perfect size when diced for these Peanut Chicken Lettuce Wraps.\n*   **Generously oil your grill grates**. I do this by rolling up a few paper towels, drenching them in oil (canola or vegetable), and while using tongs, I rub the drenched paper towels along the grill grates. Doing this will contribute to a beautiful sear, and ensure the chicken doesn’t stick to the grates. \n*   **Let the cooked chicken rest:** Chicken needs to rest, tented with foil, for 5-10 minutes before cutting in. This helps the juices redistribute inside the chicken, rather than leaking out.\n*   **Turmeric tip:** Turmeric has a brilliant yellow/orange color and will dye your hands, table, cutting board, and even your kids the same bright color, so don’t use it on surfaces you don’t want to be scrubbing forever after making this meal. \n\n**Not grilling the chicken?** If you don’t have the grill fired up, then I recommend [sautéing](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Sauteed-Chicken) it instead. To sauté the chicken, cut it into small bite-sized pieces and toss with all the seasonings. Add oil to a large skillet and sauté until chicken is cooked through and registers 165 degrees F. Timing will vary depending on the size of the chicken but should take around 5-7 minutes. Once cooked, allow to cool, and then dice the chicken into even smaller pieces.\n\nI also tested these wraps with **rotisserie** **chicken**. While we definitely preferred the texture and seasonings of the grilled chicken, it was still pretty tasty with warmed, diced rotisserie chicken (especially when you consider how fast it came together).\n\nPeanut Chicken Lettuce Wrap veggies\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   **Lettuce**: I recommend using **butter** **(Boston) lettuce**. It has a nice flavor, a good amount of crispness, and rolls up nicely.\n*   **Carrots**: Use a bag of **matchstick** **carrots** if you’re in a hurry. I love the flavor and crispiness of **whole** **carrots**, so I use them to make my own matchstick carrots. However, that takes an extra few minutes, so use whatever method you have time for. \n*   **Cucumbers**: I highly recommend using **Persian** or **English** **cucumbers** since they’re much crispier than regular cucumbers. In these wraps, crispiness is important.\n*   **Red** **pepper**: Any sweet bell pepper works; red, orange, or yellow. You can even leave out the pepper and use extra carrots or cucumber if you prefer.\n*   **Other** **ideas**: If you want to try a different combination of veggies, try very thinly sliced red **cabbage**, thinly sliced kale (or **kale slaw**), or **broccoli** **slaw**.\n\n ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20105%20134'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n### QUICK TIP\n\nWhen choosing lettuce for these wraps, look for a type with large leaves and a flexible texture that will roll easily. Romaine lettuce, for instance, has a thick rib in the middle and it cracks when bent. Iceberg is a better choice because the leaves are more flexible and round like a tortilla. I recommend butter lettuce because it’s even more flexible. When you’re at the grocery store, look for lettuce that will make a good tortilla substitute! Cabbage will work as well, but it has a different flavor and is so firm that it needs to be blanched first.\n\n ![A colorful assortment of fresh raw vegetables ready to be added to chicken lettuce wraps with peanut sauce.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201205'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPeanut Chicken Lettuce Wrap toppings\n------------------------------------\n\nThe toppings for these lettuce wraps are simple, but pack in even more flavor and texture. Add whatever you’d like! Listed below are our three “must-have” additions:\n\n*   **Chopped peanuts or cashews**: I like getting **roasted and salted** nuts for these wraps. They add the perfect finishing touch and replace the need for salt.\n*   **Fresh cilantro**: Chop right before serving or just grab a few full stems and add them right on top.\n*   **Fresh** **lime**: I usually serve these wraps with a few lime wedges on the side so everyone can add a few squeezes of fresh lime right before eating. I intentionally didn’t add lime juice to the sauce because I planned for it here. \n\n ![Culmination of chicken peanut lettuce wrap recipe: assembled wraps, peanut sauce ingredients, blended sauce, and drizzling sauce over lettuce wrap.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201205'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nMore low-carb recipes:\n----------------------\n\n*   [Egg Roll in a Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/egg-roll-in-a-bowl/)\n*   [Turkey Meatloaf](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/turkey-meatloaf/)\n*   [Ground Turkey](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/cabbage-stir-fry/) Stir Fry\n*   [Caprese Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/caprese-salad-basil-dressing/) _with Basil Dressing_\n*   [Spaghetti Squash with Turkey Meatballs](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spaghetti-squash-with-turkey-meatballs/)\n\n### Lettuce Wraps\n\n*   ▢ 3/4 of 1 pound (~13 ounces) boneless skinless chicken breasts\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon EACH: ground cumin, ground turmeric\n*   ▢ salt and pepper\n*   ▢ 12 large Boston or Butter lettuce leaves\n*   ▢ 1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced into matchsticks (~1 cup)\n*   ▢ 1 and 1/4 cup matchstick (julienned) carrots\n*   ▢ 1 and 1/4 cup matchstick (julienned) Persian or English cucumber (~2-3 Persian cucumbers)\n*   ▢ 2-3 tablespoons chopped peanuts\n*   ▢ Fresh lime juice and fresh cilantro, for topping\n\n### Peanut sauce/dressing\n\n*   ▢ 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoons honey\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons water\n*   ▢ 1 and 1/2 tablespoons each: rice vinegar, low sodium soy sauce\n*   ▢ 1/8 teaspoon each: pepper, cayenne pepper\n\n*   **SAUCE**: To a small powerful blender jar (I use a mini Blendtec/twister jar) add 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter, 3 tablespoons honey **(See Note 1)**, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons water, 1 and 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 1 and 1/2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, depending on your preference for heat), and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Blend until smooth and refrigerate while preparing everything else.\n    \n*   **CHICKEN**: Remove fat and halve breasts lengthwise if they are thick. Pound chicken to get the pieces uniformly thick throughout. (You can pound them with a meat mallet or the bottom of a heavy frying pan.) Pat both sides of the chicken with paper towels. On one side of the chicken, drizzle 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and rub it in. Sprinkle on half of the salt, half of the pepper, half of the turmeric, and half of the cumin. Gently press in the spices and then flip the chicken to the other side. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and spices.\n    \n*   **CHICKEN CONT.**: Preheat an indoor or outdoor grill for medium-high heat (400-450 degrees F on an outdoor grill) and generously oil the grates **(Note 2)**. Cook on the preheated grill until the chicken is golden and no longer pink in the center, about 4-5 minutes per side (or until the chicken registers 165 degrees F). Remove, cover with foil, and let stand for 5-10 minutes. When cooled slightly, dice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. **To saute the chicken instead, see Note 3.**\n    \n*   **VEGGIES**: Prep veggies while chicken is cooking: Slice a bell pepper into small matchstick-sized pieces, cut matchstick carrots (or use prepared matchstick carrots). Cut the cucumber(s) into matchstick pieces. If you aren't using salted nuts, add a pinch of salt to the veggies. Finely chop the peanuts.\n    \n*   **ASSEMBLY**: Wash and completely dry 12 lettuce leaves. Divide the cooked chicken evenly among the 12 lettuce leaves, followed by the veggies and peanuts. Add fresh cilantro and lime wedges to plates. Drizzle sauce generously over the wraps and enjoy immediately.\n    \n\n**Note 1**: **Sauce:** We love this sauce exactly how it's written, but it is quite sweet (which I think complements all the raw veggies nicely). If you prefer less sweetness, add honey slowly or add some red pepper flakes to make it a bit spicier.\n\n**Note 2**: **Grilling:** I oil the grill grates by rolling up a few paper towels, drenching them in oil (canola or vegetable), and while using tongs, rub the drenched paper towels along the grill grates right before adding the chicken.\n\n**Note 3**: **Chicken:** To saute the chicken instead: cut it into bite-sized pieces and toss with all the seasonings. Add 1 tablespoon oil to a large skillet and saute until chicken is cooked through and registers 165 degrees F. Timing will vary depending on the size of the chicken but should take around 5-7 minutes. Once cooked, allow to cool (tented with foil) and then dice the chicken into even smaller pieces.\n\nServing: 12lettuce wraps | Calories: 138kcal | Carbohydrates: 9g | Protein: 9g | Fat: 8g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 2g | Monounsaturated Fat: 4g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 20mg | Sodium: 189mg | Potassium: 294mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 6g | Vitamin A: 4063IU | Vitamin C: 23mg | Calcium: 22mg | Iron: 1mg\n\nWe do our best to provide accurate nutritional analysis for our recipes.

    "markdown": "# Blackberry Basil Ricotta Pizza\nThis pizza is one of my favorite topping combinations. I absolutely love ricotta on a thin-crust pizza. It’s one of my favorite things to get. This pizza is sauced with nothing more than olive oil and a blackberry smash, topped with mozzarella and parmesan, and dotted with fresh blackberries and fresh basil. It’s a refreshing, gourmet twist on pizza that’s easy to love.\n\n_For more interesting pizza flavor combinations, try our [cilantro-lime chicken pizza](https://thestayathomechef.com/cilantro-lime-chicken-pizza/) or our [jalapeno scalloped potato pizza](https://thestayathomechef.com/jalapeno-scalloped-potato-pizza/). Both are as fantastic as this one!_\n\nWhy You’ll Love This Pizza\n--------------------------\n\n*   Totally unique and different for a pizza flavor combination that will have you reimagining the endless possibilities of pizza!\n*   This pizza is easy to put together. We’re all for gourmet, but who said gourmet needs to be complicated?\n\n* * *\n\n![Dress up your pizza with something a little different in this Blackberry Basil Ricotta Pizza. It's elegant. It's simple. And it's totally delicious!](https://thestayathomechef.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Blackberry-Basil-Ricotta-Pizza-1-1-2848x4272.jpg)\n\nWhen you are in my line of work people are always asking you what your favorite thing to eat is, or your favorite thing to make, or what your signature dish is. That’s such a hard question to answer because I’m constantly making and perfecting new dishes. But if you were going to force an answer from me, well,  I love pizza. It sounds lame and even a bit childish, but if I was stuck only eating one thing for the rest of my life I would want it to be pizza. There are so many possibilities of topping combinations that I could eat pizza every day for every meal and not eat the same combination again for months. That’s only because my imagination is limited and would eventually reach an end.\n\nCrust Options\n-------------\n\nThis recipe makes one 14 to 16-inch pizza and calls for an **_unbaked_** crust. You can purchase premade pizza crusts and premade dough at the store which will work great in this recipe. If you prefer homemade, we recommend our [Easy Homemade Pizza Dough](https://thestayathomechef.com/easy-homemade-pizza-dough/), or our [Italian Style Pizza Dough](https://thestayathomechef.com/pizza-dough/).\n\n![Dress up your pizza with something a little different in this Blackberry Basil Ricotta Pizza.

We can’t get enough of that hot honey!\n\nStorage and Reheating Instructions\n----------------------------------\n\nStore any leftover slices in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to dive back in (because let’s face it, you will be), preheat your oven to 375 degrees and bake for about 10 minutes. The goal is to revive that crispy crust while ensuring the toppings are heated through. Microwaving is quick but might leave you with a slightly softer crust.\n\n#### More yummy pizzas…"

They are so good for breakfast, snack, or dessert! \n\n![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-16.jpg)\n\nBut, I am pretty sure that is the way most of us are feeling right about now.\n\nIt’s the very last few days of winter and those can be some of the worst. I am currently looking out the window at a whiteout. So ya, I am so ready for spring. Sunshine, warmth and berries out the yazoo! Unfortunately, I am pretty sure that most berries are summer foods so I still have a few months. Although, the spring strawberries are starting to pop up. Yesss. Give me them all.\n\nPlease.\n\n![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-2.jpg)\n\nIf you wanted to, you could use strawberries in these, really any berry or dried fruit you love would work. Pretty sure they’d all be good, but I wanted something other than cranberries so I went with blueberries. Well, that and I really love blueberries + they were magically on sale last week and I could not  resist buying four cartons. I could have eaten them all at once, but sadly I did something friendly and shared.\n\nI shouldn’t have. They were so good.\n\n**![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-31.jpg)**\n\nI can’t actually find dried blueberries where I live, so I used fresh ones that I dried out in the oven. If it’s easier for you, feel free to just buy dried ones. The bonus to quickly doing it yourself is that they are not coated in sugar. But I gotta say, stopping yourself from eating them is kind of hard.\n\nI’d buy extra. Like a lot.\n\n![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-5.jpg)\n\nAlright, but let’s talk about the greek yogurt coating.\n\nYes, it’s really greek yogurt that you have to let sit out (preferably overnight), so it dries and forms a coating. Just like the yogurt covered granola bars you would buy in the store, but a little healthier. While the bars themselves are super healthy, the coating is more like a frosting with some greek yogurt. It’s super delicious, but um yeah, there is sugar in that coating. It’s all about balance.\n\n![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-6.jpg)\n\nOh, and the photo above? Please excuse my scratched up nail polish and ring that is slightly too big for my thumb.\n\nI was in the kitchen working with three five years old and well, they just sort of took over. Both the baking and then my hands. Before I knew it I was receiving a kindergarten manicure complete with jewelry. I have to say though, I do love that ring. It’s one of my favorites. And as far as the nails go, I mean for five-year olds, I would say that all in all, they did a pretty good job. Not sure I could have done any better to be honest.\n\n![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-7.jpg)\n\nEven though it was mad chaos with three little girls, their heels (really my heels, all from when I was living in LA, and all at least 3 inches tall) and accessories, we had fun making these.\n\nThey stirred, they dipped, they licked and things were flying everywhere in the process.\n\n![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-8.jpg)\n\nAside from the fact that the bars require a decent chunk of time for the yogurt to dry out, they are actually pretty simple and super easy.\n\nI used this recipe from the Kitchn for the yogurt coating and I have to say that I was really skeptical on whether or not it would work, but WOW it so did.\n\n![Blueberry Vanilla Greek Yogurt Granola Bars | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blueberry-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-Granola-Bars-9.jpg)\n\nI left mine to dry overnight twice and would recommend doing the same.

You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.\n*   **Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.\n*   **Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad. I recommend mango, peaches, nectarines, and apricots. You can also add citrus fruit which will pair well with shrimp, such as oranges, mandarine oranges, or grapefruit.\n*   **Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice.\n\nTips for Success\n----------------\n\n*   **Use pre-cooked shrimp.** It saves so much time, and this avocado salad is just a great way to dress up the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp.\n*   **Any size of shrimp works.** I do prefer to use large, but this is a great recipe to use up smaller cooked shrimp!\n*   **Cook shrimp from scratch.** If you have raw shrimp, simply cook it on the stovetop. Here is a nice, light recipe for [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/).\n*   **Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!\n*   **Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.\n\nHow to tell if an avocado is ripe?\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.\n*   **An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.\n\nMake-ahead tips\n---------------\n\n*   If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.\n*   Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.\n\nMore shrimp recipes\n-------------------\n\n*   [Garlic Butter Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/garlic-butter-shrimp/)\n*   [Shrimp Scampi with Capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n*   [Honey-Mustard Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/honey-mustard-garlic-shrimp/)\n*   [Lemon Shrimp Orzo](https://juliasalbum.com/lemon-shrimp-orzo-asparagus/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime and Black Bean Rice Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-black-bean-shrimp-and-rice/)\n\nOther healthy salads you might like\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   [Apple Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/apple-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Holiday Salad with Spinach, Mandarin Oranges, Pecans, Cranberries, Goat Cheese, and Honey-Mustard Lime Vinaigrette](https://juliasalbum.com/holiday-salad/)\n*   [Peach Blueberry Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/peach-blueberry-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Berry Spinach Salad with Blueberries, Raspberries, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/berry-spinach-salad-with-blueberries-raspberries/)\n*   [Strawberry Spinach Salad with Feta cheese, Pecans, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/strawberry-spinach-salad-recipe/)\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

If that’s not enough, the bowls are then topped with [mango salsa](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/) and some sweet fried plantains on the side, perfection.\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-2.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)\n\nThis recipe is special for me as it is near and dear to my heart. One of the reasons I fell in love with cooking was because I always had strong, positive female role models who always took such care and pride in preparing meals for their loved ones. From my grandma, to my mom, down to my aunties they showed me how to put love in food, and how it was the most important ingredient. Recently I lost one of my aunties, and I want to dedicate this post and recipe to her.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of my Aunt was her preparing breakfast for my Uncle and all of her nieces and nephews. She used to make the best sausages, and her kitchen was never dull as she would dance and sing all while cooking. We used to laugh as kids because food used to fly around the kitchen whenever she was in there, and man her food was ALWAYS amazing!\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-9.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nIt’s been tough dealing with losing her, but I take comfort in knowing that she’s always with me especially when I’m in the kitchen. In my culture, we celebrate life and not death. So to celebrate her life and the love of the journey that life takes us all on, I decided to get in the kitchen and whip up these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls (something I know she would’ve loved) and pour a glass of [Wente Vineyard’s Riva Ranch Chardonnay](https://ooh.li/83923f3) as a toast to her and all the lives she touched.\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-5.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nThese bowls are full of life, flavor, and spice just like my aunty. Let me break down the components of yumminess for you!\n\n1.  Cuban Style Chicken- I marinated this chicken in such amazing spices! Cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, chili powder, fresh garlic, lime juice and zest, and orange juice and zest! This chicken is perfect with pretty much anything. In a salad, tacos, sandwiches, etc!  Very similar to my [Mojo Cuban Pork](https://evseats.com/cuban-sandwiches/) recipe, how can you pass up on delicious moist and juicy chicken?!\n2.  Cuban Style Black Beans- Oh! These may just be my favorite part! More amazing flavors of cumin and smoked paprika. I mash half of the beans and mix it all together to keep some texture, and it’s just delicious! I’ve been known to just eat a whole pan of these, lol!\n3.  Cilantro Lime Rice- Okay by now we all know how much I love rice, but this rice is next level! Chipotle has nothing on this cilantro lime rice! 🙂\n\n[MANGO SALSA RECIPE](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-7.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](http://https//ooh.li/83923f3)\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-6.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nYou can top the bowls with whatever you like.

To a blender, combine the ingredients for the chicken marinade. Add the cumin, chili powder, dried oregano, salt and pepper, 4 cloves garlic, zest and juice of 1 orange, and the zest and juice of 1 lime to the blender. Blend together until everything is finely chopped and smooth.\n2.  Add the chicken to a bowl or a Ziploc bag and pour half the marinade over the chicken. Toss to coat and allow the chicken to sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the marinade.\n3.  Heat a large skillet with vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot add the chicken and cook, 10-12 minutes or until browned all over and cooked throughout. Add the remaining marinade to the skillet and cook until it has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.\n\n**Black Beans**\n\n1.  Heat the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the onions and saute for 3-4 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and saute 30-60 seconds. Add the black beans and spices and cook for 5-10 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until soft. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil allowing to toast for about a minute. Add the chicken broth and increase the heat to high, allowing it to come to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and place the lid onthe pan.

Add the lime, cilantro and season with salt and pepper, to taste.\n3.  To serve, divide the cilantro lime rice among bowls. Top with chicken and black beans.

After _almost_ 30 years, I FINALLY have a BBQ in my home. It’s only been one month, and I’ve already been using it to death!\n\nOne of my favourite recipes that I’ve made on the BBQ so far is this Grilled Zucchini With Goat Cheese, Basil & Honey. My boyfriend and I have been making it on repeat.\n\nIt’s SO easy to cook, uses only 5 ingredients _(plus salt + pepper)_, and adds such a fun punch of flavour to zucchini.

I promise it’s super easy and takes just a few steps! Check out my answers to some common questions below:\n\n**How do you cut up zucchini?**\n\nI recommend cutting zucchini lengthwise into long strips. Remove the ends off the zucchini and cut into 1/3-inch or 1/2-inch slices.\n\nDepending on the size of your zucchini, you’ll end up with 3-4 strips per vegetable.\n\n**Should you salt zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYes! I definitely recommend salting the cut up strips of zucchini prior to grilling them. Simply sprinkle them with salt, then let them sit for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe salt will pull out a lot of the water in the zucchini, which you can pat off before putting them on the grill. This will help prevent a watery mess!\n\n**Do you peel zucchini before grilling?**\n\nNever :). I always suggest to leave the zucchini skins on. The skins of fruits + veggies often contain a TON of the nutrients and fibre. You don’t want to miss out on it!\n\n**Should you oil zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYup! I recommend brushing both sides of each zucchini slice with a little bit of olive or [avocado oil](https://www.walderwellness.com/recommends/avocado-oil/) before placing them on the grill. This helps to prevent the zucchini from drying out and sticking to the grill.\n\n![overhead shot of wood cutting board with zucchini, honey, goat cheese, and basil](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-1-683x1024.jpg)\n\nIs Grilled Zucchini Healthy?\n----------------------------\n\nYou bet! Zucchini is not only delicious, but it’s jam-packed with nutrition benefits, too.\n\nZucchini is rich in many **micronutrients**, like:\n\n*   **vitamin A**\n*   **vitamin C**\n*   **vitamin K**\n*   **vitamin** **B6**\n*   **folate**\n*   **manganese**\n*   **magnesium**\n*   **potassium**\n*   **copper**\n\nThis summer squash is also a great source of **dietary fibre**, with one medium zucchini providing 2 grams or 8% of your daily fibre needs.\n\nLike other fruits and veggies, zucchini is also a great source of **antioxidants**, especially carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin.\n\n![light blue plate with grilled zucchini slices topped with crumbled goat cheese, basil and honey](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-2-683x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat To Pair With Grilled Zucchini\n----------------------------------\n\nNeed some ideas to make this grilled zucchini a full meal? I highly recommend pairing it with a yummy protein and starch to make it nutritionally-balanced.\n\n**Protein ideas:**\n\n*   [Garlic Shrimp With Smoked Paprika & Honey](https://www.walderwellness.com/garlic-shrimp-with-smoked-paprika-honey/)\n*   [Crispy Turmeric Salmon With Yogurt Sauce](https://www.walderwellness.com/crispy-turmeric-salmon-yogurt-sauce/)\n*   [Honey Mustard Garlic Shrimp](https://www.walderwellness.com/honey-mustard-garlic-shrimp/)\n*   [Honey Lemon Oven-Baked Salmon With Thyme](https://www.walderwellness.com/honey-lemon-oven-baked-salmon-thyme/)\n*   [25-Minute Baked Salmon With Pistachio Pesto](https://www.walderwellness.com/baked-salmon-pistachio-pesto/)\n*   [Crispy Baked Tofu With Maple Miso Sauce](https://www.walderwellness.com/crispy-baked-tofu-maple-miso-sauce/)\n*   [Crispy Salmon With Coconut, Honey & Lime](https://www.walderwellness.com/crispy-salmon-coconut-honey-lime/)\n*   [Easy Curry Tofu Scramble](https://www.walderwellness.com/easy-curry-tofu-scramble-vegan/)\n*   [The Best Canned Salmon Burger](https://www.walderwellness.com/heart-healthy-salmon-quinoa-burgers-with-parsley-dill/)\n\n**Starch ideas:**\n\n*   [How To Cook & Season Quinoa: 3 Recipes](https://www.walderwellness.com/how-to-cook-quinoa-recipes-to-add-flavour/)\n*   [How To Cook Farro](https://www.walderwellness.com/how-to-cook-farro/)\n*   [Crispy Roasted Potatoes With Chili & Paprika](https://www.walderwellness.com/crispy-roasted-potatoes-with-chili-paprika/)\n*   [Roasted Potatoes With Za’atar & Lemon](https://www.walderwellness.com/roasted-potatoes-zaatar-lemon/)\n\n**TIP:** If you have any leftovers of this grilled zucchini, they taste great thrown into a salad, pasta, or sandwich!\n\n![light blue plate with grilled zucchini slices topped with crumbled goat cheese, basil and honey](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nMore Easy Zucchini Recipes\n--------------------------\n\n*   [Raw Zucchini Salad With Lemon Vinaigrette](https://www.walderwellness.com/raw-zucchini-salad/)\n*   [Creamy Vegan Zucchini Pesto](https://www.walderwellness.com/creamy-zucchini-pesto-pasta-vegan/)\n*   [Vegan Zucchini Squash Casserole](https://www.walderwellness.com/easy-healthy-zucchini-squash-casserole/)\n*   [Zucchini Bread Steel Cut Oatmeal](https://www.walderwellness.com/healthy-zucchini-bread-steel-cut-oatmeal/)\n*   [Easy Roasted Zucchini With Parmesan & Basil](https://www.walderwellness.com/roasted-zucchini-parmesan-basil/)\n*   [Pan Seared Scallops & Zucchini Noodle Pasta](https://www.walderwellness.com/pan-seared-scallops-zucchini-noodle-pasta/)\n\nDid you give this **Grilled Zucchini With Goat Cheese, Basil & Honey** a try?

If that’s not enough, the bowls are then topped with [mango salsa](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/) and some sweet fried plantains on the side, perfection.\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-2.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)\n\nThis recipe is special for me as it is near and dear to my heart. One of the reasons I fell in love with cooking was because I always had strong, positive female role models who always took such care and pride in preparing meals for their loved ones. From my grandma, to my mom, down to my aunties they showed me how to put love in food, and how it was the most important ingredient. Recently I lost one of my aunties, and I want to dedicate this post and recipe to her.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of my Aunt was her preparing breakfast for my Uncle and all of her nieces and nephews. She used to make the best sausages, and her kitchen was never dull as she would dance and sing all while cooking. We used to laugh as kids because food used to fly around the kitchen whenever she was in there, and man her food was ALWAYS amazing!\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-9.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nIt’s been tough dealing with losing her, but I take comfort in knowing that she’s always with me especially when I’m in the kitchen. In my culture, we celebrate life and not death. So to celebrate her life and the love of the journey that life takes us all on, I decided to get in the kitchen and whip up these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls (something I know she would’ve loved) and pour a glass of [Wente Vineyard’s Riva Ranch Chardonnay](https://ooh.li/83923f3) as a toast to her and all the lives she touched.\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-5.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nThese bowls are full of life, flavor, and spice just like my aunty. Let me break down the components of yumminess for you!\n\n1.  Cuban Style Chicken- I marinated this chicken in such amazing spices! Cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, chili powder, fresh garlic, lime juice and zest, and orange juice and zest! This chicken is perfect with pretty much anything. In a salad, tacos, sandwiches, etc!  Very similar to my [Mojo Cuban Pork](https://evseats.com/cuban-sandwiches/) recipe, how can you pass up on delicious moist and juicy chicken?!\n2.  Cuban Style Black Beans- Oh! These may just be my favorite part! More amazing flavors of cumin and smoked paprika. I mash half of the beans and mix it all together to keep some texture, and it’s just delicious! I’ve been known to just eat a whole pan of these, lol!\n3.  Cilantro Lime Rice- Okay by now we all know how much I love rice, but this rice is next level! Chipotle has nothing on this cilantro lime rice! 🙂\n\n[MANGO SALSA RECIPE](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-7.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](http://https//ooh.li/83923f3)\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-6.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nYou can top the bowls with whatever you like. I went with a mango salsa, which I have an amazing recipe for [here](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/), and of course some fried [plantains](https://evseats.com/fried-plantains/)!

Cook for about 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has absorbed.\n2.  Turn off the heat and allow rice to sit with the lid on for an additional 5 minutes. Add the lime, cilantro and season with salt and pepper, to taste.\n3.  To serve, divide the cilantro lime rice among bowls. Top with chicken and black beans.

Perfect for summer bbq’s and picnics!_ \n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nHey y’all! Guess I’m a Texan now, cause that just rolls off the tongue a little too easy 🙂 As some of you know, I’m a meal planning crazy. It comes in handy most of the time, but is also a curse at moments. Like, for instance, when Kev wants to wrap his scrambled eggs in a tortilla for breakfast and I practically fall out of my chair in protest because those were so specifically reserved for quesadillas and enchiladas this week. Or like when I have an itch to get creative in the kitchen, but I literally have no ingredients that aren’t already promised to another dish.\n\nI’m a big fan of getting my meals organized at the beginning of the week because it takes so much stress out of the day to day, but I’m also trying to teach myself about flexibility and adaptability when things don’t go as planned.\n\nThis week when I was trying to plan my meals, my brain froze trying trying to piece all the days together. I was struggling trying to figure out what I was going to make for our small group and how I could tie that in with the blog and the recipes I need to test for my contribution to Pressure Cooking Today, and on top of that figuring out if we have enough for lunch and dinners for the week! It can be a lot, and I know many of you are also having a hard time trying to figure out this whole meal planning thing.\n\nI’ve found that in these busy summer months, it’s most simple to have a rotating schedule of recipes that are my go to’s for the nights at home, and then when we have special occasions or bbq’s to attend, those are the times that I’ll add a fun new recipe into the rotation. That way all I have to figure out for the week is which of my stand by recipes I need to make for dinner and then add any extra ingredients to the shopping list for outside engagements.\n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nThis Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad is one of my favorite recipes to throw together with minimal labor, minimal cost, and it’s something that almost everyone loves! I tend to go simple with pasta salad because why overcomplicate something that’s so good already with only a couple of ingredients?\n\nIn the time it takes the pasta to cook, I can get my dressing whisked together and my veggies chopped and ready, only leaving me to combine the pasta with the rest of the goodies! I love the [balsamic](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9123169-13305110?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthrivemarket.com%2Fp%2Fkitchen-love-balsamic-vinegar-of-modena-premium&cjsku=728119099486) and lemon combination because it adds a zing to the crisp veggies and pairs well with the bright flavor of the fresh parsley.\n\nI prefer my Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad cold, but if you like it slightly warm, you can assemble your veggies and dressing, stir with the warm pasta right out of the pot, and serve immediately!\n\nBon Appetit!\n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-3.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://www.kitschencat.com/lemon-balsamic-summer-pasta-salad/print/6406/)\n\n### Description\n\n_Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad is a light and fresh mix of pasta and your favorite veggies.

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

The opinions and text are all mine._\n\nDoes the cold weather make you just crave comfort food?  I know it does that to me.  And although I have plenty of room on my meal plan for [warm soups](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/), [cheesy pasta](https://www.foxandbriar.com/one-pot-pasta-bake-sausage-wine/) and all other kinds of comfort food, sometimes I want to keep it healthier and focus on fruits and veggies.  As I shared before with my [Roasted Shrimp, Fennel and Grapefruit Kale Salad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/roasted-shrimp-fennel-and-grapefruit-kale-salad/), I like my cool weather salads to be bulked up with roasted veggies and grains.  Here I have kept the farro and kale, but added roasted delicata squash and pomegranate aerials for that sweet tart zing.  Once again, my local Fred Meyer came through for me by having all the ingredients I needed for this salad, including these gorgeous pomegranates.\n\n[Jump to recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/autumn-harvest-salad-with-pomegranates/#recipe)\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

However, you could also use chicken thighs, but cooking times may vary. When cubing the chicken, try to get them as close in size as possible for even cooking.\n\n**Seasonings:** To season the chicken, you will need paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and pepper.\n\n**[Mayonnaise](https://iamhomesteader.com/homemade-mayonnaise/):** The mayonnaise gives the sauce the creamy texture and richness that bang bang sauce is known for.

You can definitely add more (or use less), depending on how much heat you can handle!\n\n**Honey:** Honey is used to balance out the flavors of the sauce. It adds a natural sweetness that helps to counteract the heat from the Sriracha and balances the tanginess of the Thai sweet chili sauce.\n\n![Raw Bang Bang Chicken Skewers Before Cooking.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-3.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer.

If using wooden skewers, be sure they are soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before using them. Soaking them in water prevents the skewers from charring during cooking. If using metal skewers, make sure they fit in the basket of your air fryer. If using wooden skewers, you can break them in half if you need to shorten them.\n\n![Hand Holding One Bang Bang Chicken Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bangchicken.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer.

You can get the seasoned chicken skewers assembled ahead of time as well as make the bang bang sauce in advance. Once you have the chicken on the skewers, you can store them in the refrigerator or freeze them before cooking. If stored in the refrigerator, they will last 2-3 days, covered. These can also be frozen ahead of time. To freeze, tightly wrap the chicken skewers; they will last in the freezer for up to 3 months. When ready to cook them, let the skewers thaw in the refrigerator overnight. The bang bang sauce can be mixed together and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\n\n![Bang Bang Chicken Skewers on Parchment with a Few Pieces of Chicken not on the Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-6.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer. They make for a delicious appetizer or main course and can also be made in the oven!\")\n\nStoring & Reheating Bang Bang Chicken Skewers\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any leftover chicken skewers, store the skewers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. (If preferred, you can remove the chicken from the skewers when storing.) Reheat them in the oven, microwave, or in a skillet on the stovetop. Store the leftover reserved bang bang sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Brush it over the reheated chicken.\n\n*   ▢ wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes\n\n#### Chicken\n\n*   ▢ 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon black pepper\n\n*   In a large bowl, combine the cubed chicken breasts, oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to evenly coat the chicken.\n    \n*   Working one skewer at a time, thread 4-5 chicken cubes onto each.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce, Sriracha, and honey. Mix well. This will make about 1 ¾ cups bang bang sauce.\n    \n*   Pour half of the sauce into a separate bowl and set aside to use after the chicken has been cooked. Use the rest of the sauce to brush evenly over the chicken.\n    \n*   Add the skewers to the basket of your air fryer in a single layer. (Depending on the size of the air fryer, you may have to work in batches.)\n    \n*   Air fry\\* at 400°F for 11-12 minutes, flipping halfway. Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n    \n*   Transfer the skewers to a plate and drizzle or brush with the reserved bang bang sauce. Serve immediately.\n    \n\n**\\*Oven and Grilling Instructions:**\n\n**Oven:**\n\n1.  Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2.  Place the seasoned cubes of chicken onto the skewers, then onto the lined baking sheet. (Do not brush the chicken with bang bang sauce until after baking in the oven.)\n3.  Cook the chicken skewers for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n4.  Remove from the oven. Brush with the bang bang sauce and serve.\n\n**Grill:**\n\n1.  Thread the seasoned chicken onto the skewers. (Wait until after grilling to brush with the bang bang sauce.) Grill over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes per side, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n2.  Brush the grilled chicken with the bang bang sauce.\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n\nYou can tag me at @iamhomesteader.\n\nWhat the **Test Kitchen** had to say about this recipe:\n\n![](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8710-343x343.jpg)\n\nAutumn\n\nIf you are looking for a simple dish that packs some serious flavor, this one is for you.

I usually make extra just to have for other recipes because it is just that good.\n\n![](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8708-343x343.jpg)\n\nElizabeth\n\nI am a huge fan of bang bang sauce, so I knew I would love it on these chicken skewers.

In the recipe card below, you’ll find a go-to dough recipe that I use for all types of flatbread and pizza recipes. In fact, I even used this same dough recipe in my [**_Wrapped Asparagus Spears_**](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wrapped-asparagus-spears-with-garlic-butter-and-parmesan/) recipe. It’s a completely versatile and adaptable dough.\n\nThere are several types of bread that can fall into the flatbread category. Some of them have yeast and some don’t. I tend to like a little bit of yeast in my flatbread and pizza dough. Not so much that it puffs up a lot, just enough so that it’s more substantial.\n\nMake your own online recipe box!\n--------------------------------\n\n**Click the in the lower right corner of your screen  \n& follow the quick and easy instructions!**\n\n### FLATBREAD OPTIONS\n\nIf you’re not feeling up to making your own dough at home, you can certainly buy pre-made flatbread and still make a great-tasting dinner. I have often purchased flatbread at the grocer and topped it with sauce, cheese, and our favourite toppings. It’s a great way to whip up dinner in a hurry. And, it’s a lot cheaper than pizza delivery!\n\nThis recipe will work perfectly with focaccia, even though it’s a very thick type of flatbread. Naan works very well! Roti will work well too, especially if you’re looking for unleavened bread. (Unleavened is a term that applies to breads that do not include an ingredient such as yeast which makes the bread rise and proof. Most flat types of bread and unleavened breads.)\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

I had made up a double batch of the dough a little while ago and decided to make a **_[Traditional Newfoundland Pizza](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/homemade-newfoundland-pizza/)_** for myself and McKenna. I knew John.e wouldn’t eat it, because Newfie pizza is a far cry from being vegetarian.\n\nArmed with black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta, I decided to make a Mediterranean-style flatbread for him. If you’ve been a reader of this blog for any serious amount of time, you would have known that this flatbread wasn’t for me as soon as you looked at the photographs.\n\nI refuse to eat black olives, but John.e loves them. To date, there are over 500 recipes here at Lord Byron’s Kitchen, and this is only the second recipe that features black olives. My [**_Warm Farro Salad_**](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/warm-farro-salad/) has black olives in it too. I can’t make _all_ of the recipes for myself. I have to be nice and make a recipe or two with ingredients that I don’t really care for, right?\n\n### CHANGE IT UP; MAKE IT YOUR OWN!\n\nNow, just because this particular flatbread is modelled after common Mediterranean ingredients, that doesn’t mean you are stuck making your version the exact same way. You can add any toppings you like to your flatbread. You can even make one very large flatbread or two smaller ones like I made.\n\nMost kids are picky eaters, so you might want to change up the black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta. I’ve used this same technique described in the recipe card and added just cheese and pepperoni on many occasions. The recipe is very forgiving and completely adaptable.\n\nIf by chance you or your family cannot finish the flatbread – no worries! Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread can be saved and reheated later. Let the flatbread completely cool and then refrigerate. When ready to reheat, wrap loosely in aluminum foil and bake for 5-7 minutes in a 350-degree preheated oven.\n\nThe aluminum foil should not touch the top of the pizza but should cover it. This will prevent the toppings from burning, and will also prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil. If you freeze the leftovers, allow the flatbread to thaw completely at room temperature before attempting to reheat.\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

For exact amounts and measurements, refer to the printable recipe card located near the bottom of this post.\n\n#### FOR THE DOUGH:\n\n*   **_Active Dry Yeast_** – Do not confuse this with Instant Yeast. Active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water before using, while instant yeast can be mixed right into dry ingredients.\n*   **_Olive Oil_** – You can also use vegetable, canola, avocado oil, etc.\n*   **_Sugar_** – This might seem odd, but the sugar makes for a tastier dough, plus, it gives the yeast something to feed on which promotes proofing or rising.\n*   **_Flour_** – I only ever used all-purpose unbleached flour in my dough. I have not experimented with other flour options at this point.\n*   **_Warm Water_** – The water should be as close to 110 degrees F as possible. Too hot and you will kill the yeast; too cold and it won’t activate properly.\n*   **_Salt_**\n\n#### Lord Byron’s Notes\n\nActive Dry Yeast and Instant Yeast are essentially the same thing and both of them will give you the same result in the end. The difference is that active dry yeast works more slowly than instant yeast and is often used in recipes where water is mixed with the yeast to activate it before the dry ingredients are added to prepare the dough. In contrast, instant yeast works much faster and does not need to be activated by water. It is almost always mixed right into the dry ingredients.\n\n**Scroll down to the comment section and write me a message.**\n\n_I will personally respond as soon as possible!_\n\n#### FOR THE TOPPINGS:\n\nThese toppings are just suggestions. You can change it up and make a flatbread that suits your personal tastes.\n\n*   **_Mozzarella_** – Use fresh mozzarella and slice it about 1/4 inch thick.\n*   **_Sun Dried Tomatoes_** – Use the ones packed in oil. They have better flavour.\n*   **_Black Olives_** – I do not like olives at all, but I made this flatbread for John.e and he loves them. You can use green or none at all if that’s what pleases you.\n*   **_Feta_** – I love crumbled feta on flatbread, especially when it is a Mediterranean-inspired flatbread!\n*   **_Dried Herbs_** – Basil and oregano are perfect on this one!\n*   **_Parsley_** – Used for garnish and is optional.\n*   **_Egg_** – Beat with a little bit of water, this is used to brush the outside of the dough. It helps to brown the dough so that it looks better. You can skip this too if you wish.\n*   **_Non-stick Cooking Spray_**\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes! Simply change the toppings to suit your preferences! #flatbread #pizza #Mediterranean #homemade #recipe](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Homemade-Mediterranean-Flatbread-b-532x800.jpg)\n\n### HOW TO MAKE FLATBREAD:\n\n#### Let’s make the dough first!\n\nLet’s start with preparing the dough. If you have purchased dough from the grocer, follow the instructions on the package. Otherwise, make the dough from scratch by following these simple instructions.\n\nFill a mixing bowl with hot tap water. This will temper the bowl which is important to yeast activation and growth. Measure out 3/4 cup of water that’s 110 degrees F. Pour the water out of the bowl. Place one teaspoon of sugar into the bottom of the bowl and pour over the 3/4 cup of water. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water and let sit for two minutes.\n\nNext, whisk in the olive oil. Add the flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir the flour into the water and oil. Use your hand to knead the dough until it forms a smooth ball. Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside to rise. (Be sure to keep away from drafts or an open window.)\n\n![](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-800x533.jpg)\n\n#### Now, the fun part! Let’s assemble the flatbread!\n\nOnce the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F, and lightly spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Using only half of the dough per sheet pan, place the dough onto the pan and use a rolling pin to roll it out into an oblong or rectangular shape.\n\nNext, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough. Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n\nNext, top each pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta. Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano. Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if you are using it, and slice the flatbread into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes! Simply change the toppings to suit your preferences! #flatbread #pizza #Mediterranean #homemade #recipe](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6-1-533x800.jpg)\n\n### RECIPE TIPS & TRICKS\n\nThe key to a really good flatbread is the dough. You can use the dough recipe here and create any flavour of flatbread that you want. I have made this same dough and spread sun-dried tomato pesto on it with some mozzarella and pepperoni for a make-at-home pizza. I’ve also mixed together equal parts butter and parmesan cheese with a clove of minced garlic and a little splash of olive oil. Spread it over the dough and bake until bubbly. You now have easy garlic fingers! Be sure to dip them in my **_[Donair Sauce](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/newfoundland-donair-sauce/)_**!\n\nYou can also make the dough ahead of time. Once the dough has had time to rise, transfer it to a food-safe plastic bag. Get as much air out of the bag as possible and place the dough in the refrigerator. The dough will last in the fridge for 3-5 days. Once you’re ready to make your flatbread, remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out just like the recipe instructions indicate.\n\nIf you have any leftover flatbread, you can refrigerate it for 2-3 days and reheat it later. You can microwave it, but be sure to do so on half speed/power, otherwise, the crust gets a little chewy. You can also place the flatbread on a baking sheet and toss it in the oven. Set the oven to 200 degrees F and let it go for 5 minutes.\n\n### SERVING SUGGESTIONS\n\nIf you follow my Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread recipe exactly as written, you might want to continue the theme if you are looking to feed a larger group of people. I do this simply by adding side dishes that will complement the main. In the case of this flatbread, I would serve it with this **_[Greek Potato Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/greek-potato-salad/)_** or this **_[Cucumber Walnut Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/cucumber-walnut-salad/)_** or this **_[Fire Roasted Tomato and Artichoke Bean Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/fire-roasted-tomato-artichoke-bean-skillet/)_**!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

This will temper the bowl and help to ensure the yeast will properly activate. While you’re waiting for the bowl to warm, preheat the oven to 500 degrees – not broil, but degrees.\n    \n*   Pour the hot water out of the bowl and wipe the bowl dry. Add the warm tap water and the yeast. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the yeast into the water for no more than 5-10 seconds. Set aside and let the yeast bubble and foam for at least 3 minutes.\n    \n*   Sift together 2 cups of the flour, salt, and sugar.\n    \n*   Add the olive oil to the yeast and water mixture. Stir for a few seconds. Pour in the entire flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed.\n    \n*   Sprinkle your clean countertop with a little flour and empty the dough out. Knead the dough together for 4-5 minutes until a dough ball is formed. Place the dough back into the metal mixing bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and set the bowl on top of your preheating oven. (Don't place the bowl on a burner, just on the surface of the oven. The heat will help the dough to proof/rise.) Let the dough sit for five minutes.\n    \n\n#### For the Pizza:\n\n*   Lightly spray two small baking sheets or pizza pans with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.\n    \n*   When the dough is ready, lightly flour a flat surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a rectangular shape about the size of your pan.  Place the dough onto the baking sheet and push the dough into the corners and up to the sides. This does not need to be perfectly round or rectangular. Just be sure the dough is evenly flattened. (Repeat with the other half of the dough on a second baking sheet or pizza pan.)\n    \n*   Next, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough.\n    \n*   Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n    \n*   Next, top each pizza with the sun dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta.\n    \n*   Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano.\n    \n*   Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if using, and slice into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n    \n\nCalories: 662kcal | Carbohydrates: 63g | Protein: 30g | Fat: 33g | Saturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 135mg | Sodium: 1315mg | Potassium: 408mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 935IU | Vitamin C: 15.3mg | Calcium: 539mg | Iron: 4.9mg\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n-------------------------\n\nUpload a photo and tag me so that I can see it!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

    "markdown": "# Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Arugula and Feta - Peas and Crayons\n_This Mediterranean Pasta Salad is tossed with tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, arugula, and feta then tossed with a tasty homemade lemon dressing! Bringing it to a party or picnic? It can easily be made in advance the day before!_\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Arugula and Feta](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-4.jpg)\n\nBeing a food blogger means I’m often playing a never-ending game of Chopped in which I have to use up all the random ingredients I buy for one recipe up by creating other recipes with the leftovers.\n\nIf I purchase a big bunch of cilantro just to use a few sprigs as a garnish, you bet your booty I’ll be putting cilantro in my next 2-3 recipes until I’ve used it all up. (I mean is this not the tastiest problem to have? haha!)\n\nToday’s recipe was inspired by a surplus of arugula in my fridge.\n\nThis peppery leafy green was the \\*perfect\\* not-so-secret ingredient for this tasty Mediterranean pasta salad!\n\nI paired it with a fresh lemon dressing (lemon and arugula are a match made in heaven!) and a whole lot of veggies! A little feta here… a sprinkle of cracked black pepper there… and I am in LOVE!\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Lemon Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-2.jpg)\n\ncan I add extra veggies?\n------------------------\n\nYes! Yes! 1000x yes! This Mediterranean pasta salad would be the perfect base for all your favorite veggies.\n\nFeel free to raid you pantry for artichoke hearts or olives or empty your crisper drawer! You can add fresh basil, spinach, onion, bell pepper, and more.\n\nFor the noodles, I used bowtie (farfalle) pasta but there are a ton of varieties that work great here! You can use ditalini, orzo, elbow noodles, rotini, or even tortellini!\n\npasta salad dressing\n--------------------\n\nI’m a big fan of homemade salad dressing because 1. They’re CRAZY quick + easy to make and 2. I pretty much always have all the ingredients I need lying around.\n\nI paired this pretty pasta salad with a fresh [lemon dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2019/03/lemon-dressing.html) but there are a few others that would also work positively fantastic here. No fresh lemons on hand? Try it with my easy homemade [Greek Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/12/easy-homemade-greek-dressing-recipe.html) or [Italian Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2015/06/easy-homemade-italian-dressing.html), both of which pair oh so perfectly with pasta and veggies.\n\nMake a little… or a lot! This pasta salad yields 8-10 side dish sized servings.\n\nThe leftovers are oh so tasty (my husband and I are all about meal prepping cold pasta salad for the week) but if you’d like a smaller batch, feel free to halve it. Need to serve a crowd at a party or barbecue? Simply double or triple the recipe below and you’re good to go!\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Arugula and Feta](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-4-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 8 oz farfalle (bowtie) pasta\n*   ▢ 3 cups chopped fresh arugula\n*   ▢ 1/2-3/4 English cucumber\n*   ▢ 1 cup diced tomato\n*   ▢ 1 avocado\n*   ▢ ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP fresh chopped parsley (optional)\n\n#### LEMON DRESSING\\*\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2fyn7A)\n*   ▢ ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (via 1-2 large lemons)\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp lemon zest plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP plain dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 2 cloves garlic, freshly. minced\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp dried oregano leaves\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp salt\n*   ▢ ⅛ tsp black pepper\n\n*   First let's make the dressing! Zest 1 lemon and set aside. Juice your lemons to yield 1/4 cup of juice and add to a small/medium mason jar. Add lemon zest and remaining dressing ingredients and close lid tightly. Shake to emulsify the dressing.\n    \n*   Next cook pasta via package instructions. For farfalle you'll boil the pasta in water for approx. 12-14 minutes.\n    \n*   Chop arugula, cucumber, tomato and optional parsley and add to a large bowl. Save the avocado for just before serving.\n    \n*   Once your pasta is perfectly al dente, strain in a colander and run cold water to halt the cooking process and chill the pasta slightly. Then add the drained pasta to your veggies an toss together. \n    \n*   Shake once more if needed and add your dressing to the salad. Toss well to coat. Lastly add avocado and feta on top and gently fold into the salad. Add extra salt and pepper if desired and enjoy!\n    \n\n\\* If leftover dressing is desired (hello meal prep!) or if you're making this salad in advance, simply double the dressing recipe. When it chills in the fridge, the pasta soaks up much of the dressing. Simply refresh with an extra drizzle or so of dressing before serving, or let guests add extra to taste. Enjoy!\n\nNo bowtie pasta? No problem! Try it with ditalini, orzo, elbow, rotini, or even tortellini!\n\nSee post for a list of tasty extras and swaps.\n\n_Nutrition Facts below are estimated using an online recipe nutrition calculator. Adjust as needed based on extras added and enjoy!_\n\nCalories: 245kcal, Carbohydrates: 26g, Protein: 6g, Fat: 13g, Saturated Fat: 2g, Cholesterol: 8mg, Sodium: 229mg, Potassium: 320mg, Fiber: 3g, Sugar: 2g, Vitamin A: 390IU, Vitamin C: 11.4mg, Calcium: 84mg, Iron: 1.1mg\n\nNeed to make a vegan version? Simply skip the feta and this salad is gloriously vegan. The creamy feta cuts a bit of the acidity of the lemon dressing so if you find it super tart, feel free to add a tsp or so of sugar or maple syrup to the dressing to taste.\n\nIf you get a chance to try this quick and easy Mediterranean Pasta Salad, let me know! Leave some love in the comment form below or tag your photos with @peasandcrayons on Instagram so I can happy dance over your creation!

Takes less than 30 minutes to make_ _this soon-to-be your favorite white pizza!_\n\n![Whole mushroom spinach white pizza cut up in the baking sheet after baking in the oven](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-7-683x1024.jpg)\n\nAh, the football season is back!  \nAlthough I'm not a huge football fan, I love me some good game day food!\n\nThe essential criteria for a good game day food depend on how convenient the food is to eat while watching the game. Think about all the classic game day food - chicken wings, nachos, hot dogs, and sliders!\n\nThat's why pizza is perfect for a game day. You can hold pizza in one hand and drink on the other! Do you see what I'm saying?\n\n### What is White pizza and how it's different from Red pizza?\n\nRed pizza is a pizza made with tomato sauce. It's the most well-known and popular pizza. **White pizza**, also known as **pizza Bianca**, is any type of **pizza made without red tomato sauce**. In Italy, pizza Bianca is a pizza with mozzarella and/or parmesan cheese with a drizzle of olive oil and salt.\n\n*   ![Whole white pizza on the baking sheet, ricotta cheese spread and sautéed mushroom and spinach on top of the pizza](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole white pizza on the baking sheet before baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-2-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![whole white pizza after baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-3-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole mushroom spinach white pizza on the baking sheet after baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-4-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n\nConventional white pizza VS. my white pizza\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you search for white pizza recipes, you will come across many recipes with alfredo-like sauce for the pizza. The white pizza sauce is often made with butter, milk, parmesan cheese, and/or cream cheese. Mine **requires NO white sauce**. So what goes into my white pizza? Read on!\n\nIngredients in Mushroom Spinach White Pizza\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Pizza dough** - You can use store-bought dough. But I have [an easy pizza dough recipe (using a stand mixer)](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/fool-proof-easy-pizza-dough-recipe/) right here! Don't have a stand mixer? No problem! Check out my [pizza dough recipe by hand](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/easy-pizza-dough-recipe-without-a-stand-mixer-with-active-dry-yeast/) here.\n*   **Ricotta cheese** - this is an equivalent ingredient to a white sauce\n*   **Herbs** - I like to use Italian dried herbs with extra dried basil\n*   **Mushroom** - You can use any type of mushroom. I used button mushroom for this recipe. \n*   **Spinach** \\- I like to sauteed fresh baby spinach leaves.\n*   **Shredded mozzarella**  \n\n*   ![Whole white pizza with extra dollops of ricotta cheese on top, before baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-8-667x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole white pizza with extra dollops of ricotta cheese on top](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-9-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n\nHow to customize\n----------------\n\n*   You can always put **dollops of ricotta** on your pizza for extra creaminess\n*   **Experiment with other cheese** - People told me they added dollops of **goat cheese** for tanginess, **grated parmesan cheese**, and even **Mexican blend** shredded cheese\n*   **Other toppings** \\- Artichoke, tomato (sun-dried or slices), fresh basil, arugula, caramelized onions will all make great toppings\n*   **Elevate your pizza crust** by brush with garlic butter or stuff it with mozzarella or leftover ricotta cheese mixture\n\nHow to reheat the pizza\n-----------------------\n\nThere are several ways to reheat your pizza. \n\n1.  **Microwave** - it is the most convenient way to reheat the pizza but it will make your pizza very chewy, especially the crust part. \n2.  **On a stovetop** - You can reheat your pizza on **a skillet with a lid on top**. This will reheat your pizza nicely with your cheese all gooey and melty without changing the texture of the crust. \n3.  **Toaster oven/oven** - This is another convenient way but I like the toaster oven option (350F for 5-6 minutes) better since I don't have to preheat the oven. However, it takes a longer time to reheat. \n4.  **Air fryer** - This is my recently discovered way! You can place the pizza slices in the air fryer basket and cook between 320F to 330F for 2-4 minutes. It's a speedy and delicious way to reheat your leftover pizza.\n\n*   ![Two slices of white pizza on a white plate with the glass of rose in the background](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-18-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Two slices of white pizza with dollops of extra ricotta cheese on top.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\n2.  On a medium-size non-stick skillet, add the sliced mushroom and cook on high heat for a couple of minutes. The water from the mushroom will start to extract and evaporate.\n3.  Once the water from the mushroom started to evaporate and the mushroom turns slightly brown, add the butter and dried thyme to the mushroom. Stir frequently and cook for an additional minute or two. Take them off the skillet and set them aside.\n4.  On the same skillet, add the oil and spinach leaves. Sprinkle garlic powder and pinch of salt to the spinach and cook until all the spinach leaves are wilted, about 3-5 minutes. \n5.  When the spinach is wilted, take it off from the heat and set it aside.\n6.  In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup of ricotta cheese, ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and ½ teaspoon of dried basil. \n7.  Divide the pizza dough in half.\n8.  Flour the working surface and start stretching the dough flat. Do the same for the other dough.\n9.  Spread the ricotta mixture to each of the stretched pizza dough evenly and thinly. \n10.  Add the cooked mushroom and spinach to both pizzas.\n11.  Add ⅓ cup of shredded mozzarella cheese (each) on top of the pizzas.\n12.  Sprinkle red pepper flakes if you like spicy pizza. If not, skip this step.\n13.  Sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top.\n14.  Place the pizzas in the oven and cook for 11-12 minutes. \n15.  Take them out of the oven and enjoy them right away.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   Red pepper flakes are totally optional. If you don't like spicy food, please skip this ingredient altogether. \n*   If you like creamy pizza, dollops of ricotta will totally give you that creaminess.\n*   Other great topping options are grated parmesan cheese and/or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. \n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

    "markdown": "# Easy Mediterranean Diet Recipes\nFor the sixth year in a row, the Mediterranean diet has been named the [No. 1 diet by U.S. News & World Report](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021106/best-and-worst-diets-2023-us-news-world-report/). From breakfast to dinner, these easy Mediterranean diet recipes are packed with ingredients like fresh vegetables, whole grains and lean protein like fish and chicken. Plus, this eating pattern is intentionally flexible so it can be customized for any flavor preferences and dietary needs. Nutritious recipes like our Garlic Roasted Salmon & Brussels Sprouts and our Berry Chia Pudding are healthy, delicious meals that will help you follow the eating pattern with ease.\n\nSheet-Pan Chicken Thighs with Brussels Sprouts & Gnocchi\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this healthy dinner recipe, chicken thighs, Brussels sprouts, cherry tomatoes and packaged gnocchi are all roasted on the same sheet pan for a complete meal that couldn't be easier to make. And though it's simple, this dish gets tons of flavor from seasonings, including garlic, oregano and red-wine vinegar. It all adds up to a dish that's ready to go into heavy weeknight rotation in your house.\n\nEgg Sandwiches with Rosemary, Tomato & Feta\n-------------------------------------------\n\nPhotographer /Antonis Achilleos, Prop Stylist / Kay Clarke, Food Stylist / Emily Nabors Hall\n\nThese hearty breakfast sandwiches are packed with ingredients popular in the Mediterranean diet, including feta, tomato and spinach.\n\nMushroom & Tofu Stir-Fry\n------------------------\n\nThis tofu veggie stir-fry is quick and easy, making it a great go-to weeknight meal. Baked tofu has a firm, toothsome texture that crisps well in a hot pan. You can find it in flavors like teriyaki and sesame, both of which are delicious here.

    "markdown": "# Greek Stuffed Peppers (Dairy and Gluten Free) | The Mediterranean Dish\nMom's famous stuffed peppers, prepared Greek style with a flavor-packed meat and rice mixture with chickpeas and fresh herbs. Diary free and gluten free. Vegetarian option included.\n\nBest part, you can prepare these ahead of time! **Be sure to check out all the tips along with the step-by-step tutorial and video below.**\n\n![Greek stuffed peppers](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-6.jpg)\n\nS**tuffed vegetables for the win!**\n-----------------------------------\n\nWe're obsessed with stuffing all the vegetables around here from [Greek](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/greek-stuffed-tomatoes-gemista/) and Spanish-style [stuffed tomatoes](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/stuffed-tomatoes-with-tuna/) to [eggplant](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/vegetarian-stuffed-eggplant/), [grape leaves](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/stuffed-grape-leaves-dolmades/), and even [stuffed squash](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/stuffed-delicata-squash/)!\n\nIn fact, stuffed vegetables are their very own class within Greek and Mediterranean cooking. In Greece, they are called _gemista_ or _yemista_ (γεμιστά), which means _things that are filled_.  And in the Middle East, they're called _mahshi_, which literally means _stuffed_!\n\nMy mom's signature Greek stuffed peppers recipe is one of those comfort foods I have always loved, and I've added my own twist on her recipe.\n\n**About this stuffed peppers recipe**\n-------------------------------------\n\nThese stuffed bell peppers are dairy free and gluten free. They are delicious and totally hit all the right flavor notes for me. And it all comes down to two things: the tasty Greek-style stuffing and how you prepare the bell peppers.\n\n**The stuffing or filling mixture** is dairy free and gluten free made of well-seasoned meat mixture with rice, chickpeas, and fresh parsley. For spices, I used a combination of allspice, sweet paprika and garlic powder (although 2 minced garlic cloves do the job, if you don't have all-natural garlic powder). For this recipe I do cook this meat mixture first before stuffing the peppers.\n\n**The bell peppers**. I use a variety of mild peppers here--green, red, and yellow. They do not all taste the same. Green peppers are a bit more on the savory/bitter side while red peppers tend to be sweeter. Choose what you like. **For a Greek style bell peppers recipe, here is how you prepare the peppers:**\n\n*   **Core the peppers but leave them whole.** Lay each pepper on its side and cut only the top part where the stem is.\n*   **Cook the peppers well until tender.** In Greek style stuffed peppers (and throughout the Mediterranean) the peppers must be cooked until fully tender, they can not be crunchy or taste raw in any way. To accomplish this, before they're stuffed, grill the peppers for a few minutes (gas grill or indoor griddle will work) until they gain a nice char all around (great flavor)! Then, once stuffed, the peppers finish cooking in the oven, covered. A little bit of liquid in the baking dish creates some steam that cooks the peppers until they are nice and super tender.\n\n![Stuffed peppers on a serving platter](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-10.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients**\n---------------\n\n*   **Extra virgin olive oil-** I used Private Reserve Greek extra virgin olive oil\n*   **Onion-** 1 small yellow onion is sauteed in extra virgin olive oil to begin making the meat mixture for the stuffing.\n*   **Ground beef**\\- ½ pound of lean ground beef (you can also use ground turkey or ground chicken). The meat will be fully browned or cooked before using in the stuffing.\n*   **Spices-** 1 teaspoon ground allspice, 1 teaspoon garlic powder (or 2 minced garlic cloves) 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika, kosher salt and black pepper to taste. The spices are used at different times in creating the stuffing or the meat and rice mixture that we use to fill the bell peppers\n*   **Chickpeas-** 1 cup of already cooked chickpeas (or from can).\n*   **Rice**\\- 1 cup of white rice. Tip: wash the rice well and let it soak in plenty of water for 20 to 30 minutes or until you are able to break one grain of rice easily. This helps cook the rice quickly and evenly.\n*   **Parsley-** 1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped (Or a mixture of chopped fresh parsley and fresh dill)\n*   **Liquid: Tomato sauce and water-** in order for the rice to cook well with the ground meat and chickpeas, you will need some liquid. ½ cup tomato sauce and 2 ½ cups of water provides that. The tomato sauce adds more of umami and a subtle color to the stuffing mixture, so don't skip it if you can. You can also use ½ cup of diced tomatoes from a can in place of the tomato sauce, if you like.\n*   **Bell peppers-** 6 large bell peppers, any color you choose. Like I mentioned earlier, you only need to remove the stem and the seeds, leaving the actual peppers pretty much whole.\n*   **Broth-** A little more liquid is needed to bake the peppers once stuffed. I like to use ¾ cup of broth or water in the baking dish.\n\n**How to Make Stuffed Peppers**\n-------------------------------\n\nTime needed: 55 minutes\n\n**Guide for how to make these Greek-style stuffed peppers (print-friendly recipe below)**\n\n1.  **Cook the meat and chickpeas for the stuffing mixture**\n    \n    The stuffing for our bell peppers begins with meat and chickpeas. To cook them, heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a pot and add chopped onions to cook briefly, then add the ground beef and cook till fully browned. Season with kosher salt, pepper and ground allspice. Add the chickpeas and toss around to cook briefly.![ground beef and chickpeas cooked for stuffing mixture](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-1.jpg)\n    \n2.  **Add the rice u0026 remaining stuffing ingredients and cook**\n    \n    Add the chopped parsley, rice (after you've soaked the rice in water for 20 minutes or so and drained it well), paprika and tomato sauce. Add 2 ½ cups of water and bring to a high simmer until the liquid is reduced by ½ (you want the water to reduce well enough that it is barely covering the rice mixture). Turn the heat to low and cover. Cook for 20 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the moisture and is fully cooked through (the rice should not be hard nor too sticky). ![Rice stuffing for stuffed bell peppers](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-5.jpg)\n    \n3.  **Grill the bell peppers**\n    \n    While the rice mixture is cooking, work on preparing the bell peppers. Use 6 large bell peppers. Remove the tops and seeds so that you have bell pepper shells to carry the stuffing.  \n    Heat a grill or indoor griddle (brushed with a little olive oil) to medium-high heat and grill the bell peppers, covered for 10 minutes or so. You will need to uncover and turn the bell peppers around frequently until they have softened a bit and gained a nice color on all sides. (Tip: You can skip grilling the peppers but allow more time for baking, they do need to be quite tender to serve).  \n    ![bell peppers on the grill](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-2.jpg)\n    \n4.  **Assemble bell pepper shells**\n    \n    Grab a baking dish that's large enough to fit the bell peppers standing up. Put ¾ cup of broth (or water) in the baking dish. Add the bell peppers open side up.![Bell peppers cored and ready for stuffing](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-4.jpg)\n    \n5.  **Stuff the bell peppers**\n    \n    Now, stuff each pepper with the rice mixture (and since the mixture is already cooked, you do not need to worry about making too much room for it to expand, you can fill the peppers all the way up pretty much).  \n    ![Bell peppers are assembled and stuffed with rice mixture before baking](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-7.jpg)\n    \n6.  **Bake u0026 serve stuffed bell peppers**\n    \n    Cover with foil and bake in a 350 degree F heated oven for 20 minutes or until the peppers are fully tender (make sure to tent the foil so it does not touch the stuffed peppers).  \n    ![Baked stuffed bell peppers ready to serve](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-9.jpg)\n    \n\n**Do you have to cook the meat before stuffing the peppers?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor this recipe, I do like to cook the meat before hand. And you'll notice, the entire stuffing mixture of meat, rice and chickpeas is fully cooked before adding to the stuffed bell peppers. This is really a fool-proof way that ensures the stuffing is cooked well and evenly and reduces the risk of having it be under-cooked or too mushy.\n\n**Variations**\n--------------\n\nYou can totally make this recipe your own. Here are a few variations you can try on this Greek stuffed peppers recipe:\n\n*   **Change up the meat.** If you like, replace ground beef with ground chicken or turkey. Adjust seasoning to your taste\n*   **Need a vegetarian stuffed peppers option?** Omit the meat all together. Cook the onions, chickpeas and rice the same way but without the meat! (Or try my [vegetarian stuffed peppers](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/vegetarian-stuffed-peppers/) with orzo and [basil vinaigrette](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/basil-vinaigrette/))\n*   **Change up the herbs and seasoning.** Instead of using just parsley, use a bit of parsley and fresh dill. And in place of allspice, you can try a little ground cumin or even Italian seasoning. Always taste the cooked stuffing mixture and adjust seasoning to your liking.\n*   **Add cheese!** This is a diary-free recipe, but if you're in the mood for cheese, a little crumbled feta for garnish just before serving will work.\n\nFor another meaty stuffed pepper recipe, don't miss our [Italian Stuffed Peppers](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/italian-stuffed-peppers/). Every bit as hearty and delicious as this Greek version!\n\n**Make ahead option**\n---------------------\n\nYou can work on this recipe one night ahead. You can prepare and cook the stuffing fully (that's the meat, rice and chickpea mixture) and you can also core and grill the bell peppers. Let everything cool and store each separately in the fridge.\n\nThe next day, proceed with the recipe and stuff and assemble the bell peppers for baking. It helps to bring things to room temperature in preparation for baking, but that's optional.\n\n![peppers on a serving platter ](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stuffed-peppers-recipe-10-683x1024.jpg)\n\n**Can you freeze stuffed peppers?**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you end up with leftovers, you can freeze these dairy free stuffed peppers.\n\nFirst, be sure to cool the stuffed peppers completely.

Thaw in fridge overnight, and warm up in a medium-heated oven (it helps to add a little bit of liquid to your baking dish, and cover the peppers before placing in oven.)\n*   **Visit our [Online Shop](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/)** to browse quality Mediterranean ingredients including [extra virgin olive oils](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product-category/olive-oil/) and all-natural and organic [spices](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product-category/spices/) used in this recipe\n\n*   Prep Time: 15 mins\n*   Cook Time: 50 mins\n*   Category: Entree\n*   Cuisine: Greek/Mediterranean\n\n\\*This post originally appeared on The Mediterranean Dish in 2018 and has been recently updated with new information and media for readers' benefit.\n\nI'm Suzy; born and bred right on the shores of the Mediterranean.

With plenty of mini pumpkins already on hand, I thought about what delicious combination of flavors to stuff inside them. Sausage, sweet onion, mushrooms, pecans, cranberries, kale, Parmigiano-Reggiano, seasonal spices, and of course, rice came together for a flavor combination that’s quintessentially fall.\n\n![Sausage, Rice, and Cranberry Mini Stuffed Pumpkins | inspiredbycharm.com](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rice-Sausage-Cranberry-Stuffed-Mini-Pumpkins-681x1024.jpg)\n\nNow stuff all of that goodness into a mini pumpkin, and what’s not to love?\n\nWhile combining all of these flavors is bound to be delicious, this dish also wins on presentation.

Stuffed pumpkins like this are basically like a healthier versions of a bread bowl (one of my personal favorite indulgences). The filling in the pumpkin bowls, with a mix of Gruyère cheese, stale bread, sautéed vegetables and ground turkey, is like a savory bread pudding.\n\nAs you eat the stuffed pumpkins, scrape the sweet flesh from the sides of the roasted pumpkin shell and devour each bite of the filling for an all-in-one twist on thanksgiving dinner. This version of Thanksgiving food is perfect for smaller holiday gatherings where roasting a whole turkey may not make sense. You still get all the holiday flavors in this dish throughout the stuffed pumpkin recipe without the day-long prep.\n\nGround Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffed Pumpkins\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### Table of contents\n\n*   [Ground Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffing Filled Roasted Mini Pumpkins](#h-ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins)\n    *   [Key Ingredients in This Recipe](#h-key-ingredients-in-this-recipe)\n    *   [How to Make Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffing Filled Roast Pumpkins](#h-how-to-make-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roast-pumpkins)\n    *   [Tips and Tricks for This Recipe](#h-tips-and-tricks-for-this-recipe)\n    *   [Other Recipes to Try](#h-other-recipes-to-try)\n\n[![small sugar pie pumpkin baguette celery sage and yellow onions](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_6039524d4b1cf.jpg)](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/2017-ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins/ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins-ingredients-shot/)\n\n### Key Ingredients in This Recipe\n\n*   **Pumpkin –** “Sugar”, “sugar pie” or “pie pumpkins” are the best types of pumpkins to use for baking. Larger varieties used for carving often have a much tougher texture and lack the sweetness of the smaller pumpkins. It acts as both the vessel and additional vegetables.\n*   **Turkey –** Ground turkey is typically made from both light and dark meat. The ground turkey in this stuffed pumpkin recipe can be swapped with ground chicken or pork though it’s not as seasonal.\n*   **Mirepoix –** A combination of carrots, celery and onion are sautéed to create the flavorful base of stuffing. This combination is referred to as sofrito in Italian and is often called a mirepoix in French cooking.\n*   **Sage –** The chopped fresh sage leaves are fried in butter to add a nutty and more complex flavor to the filling.\n*   **Gruyère cheese** – Gruyère is a hard cheese with a nutty, sweet flavor from Switzerland. The fact that it melts well (due to a high water to oil ratio) mixed with t’s distinct flavor makes it the perfect addition to anything from sandwiches to mac and cheese or fondue. If you can’t find Gruyère, I recommend substituting with another Swiss cheese like Emmental.\n\n### How to Make Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffed Pumpkins\n\n![cut open sugar pie pumpkins with seeds scooped out](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-4-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 1: Cut pumpkins.\n\nPreheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Turn each pumpkin on its side, and use a sharp knife to slice the top, including the stem, off the pumpkin, about 1-inch down. Use a spoon to remove the seeds and discard or reserve for another use.\n\n##### Step 2: Roast pumpkins. \n\nRub the inside of the pumpkins with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper then arrange the pumpkins and cut off tops on a baking sheet. Roast until the meat is soft, about 35 minutes. Set aside.\n\n![roasted sugar pumpkins with tops cut off and scooped out on baking sheet](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-19-683x1024.webp)\n\n![sautéed carrots, onions and celery in cast iron skillet](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-11-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 3: Sauté vegetables. \n\nHeat a large sauté pan over medium-low heat, add the remaining oil and heat through. Add the carrots, onion and celery and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes.\n\n##### Step 4: Cook the turkey. \n\nAdd the ground turkey to the pan and sauté, stirring occasionally and using a wooden spoon to break up any large pieces, until the meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper then remove the turkey mixture to a large mixing bowl and toss with the bread.\n\n![sautéed vegetables and ground turkey](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-13-683x1024.webp)\n\n![fried chopped sage in brown butter ](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-15-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 5: Make sage butter. \n\nLower the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).Return the pan to medium-low heat, add the butter and allow to melt. Add the sage to the pan and cook until the butter is nutty and fragrant, about 4 minutes.\n\n##### Step 6: Combine filling. \n\nAdd the sage butter to the turkey mixture.

This recipe combines sweet, spicy, and smoky flavors to create a seriously flavorful chicken bowl! The chipotle chicken marinade is quick and easy to make and goes beautifully with the sweet corn salsa and buttery avocados.\n\n![honey chipotle chicken bowls with brown rice, avocados, and corn salsa](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-1-710x1065.jpg)\n\nThat is some serious flavor right there!\n\nWe’re talking about chicken marinated in a honey chipotle mixture that’s slightly sweet, smoky, with a hint of spice, and nothing short of flavorful. It also happens to be one of the best things you can meal prep because it tastes better as it sits.\n\nWe’ll start by marinating the chicken and letting it hang out. This recipe is perfect to make on an outdoor grill in the summertime and equally delicious made on an indoor grill pan when you’re living in a tundra in the middle of winter. The marinade for this recipe is inspired by Chipotle’s vinaigrette recipe. We’ve just played around with the quantities to create a marinade rather than a dressing.\n\nThe sweet corn salsa is also inspired by Chipotle’s corn, which is totally a fiesta in your mouth. I start charring off a poblano pepper – totally optional. I know some people don’t mind the skin, but if I’m going to make this thing, I’m going to do it right. And then, we add in a squeeze of lemon juice, lime juice, a minced jalapeño, and lots of red onions. You can scoop it up with a tortilla chip, or you can serve it on top of this bowl; either way – it’s fantastic.\n\nServe it all up on a bed of your favorite rice, quinoa, or grains with slices of buttery avocados. And if you’re about to ask, doesn’t it need a sauce? You could totally do one, but honestly, it’s so flavorful that nope, we actually didn’t need one!\n\nA flavor explosion is coming at you in 3..2…1\n\n![honey chipotle diced chicken over rice](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-3-710x1065.jpg)\n\nIngredients for honey chipotle chicken bowls\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Chicken:** I used boneless skinless chicken thighs for this recipe because that’s what I had on hand. But usually, I prefer to use chicken breasts for my bowls. Needless to say, thighs, breasts, and tenders – any protein cut works for this bowl.\n*   **Chipotle Peppers:** I use a can of chipotles that are packed in adobo sauce. You’ll need 1-2 peppers for this recipe, depending on how much heat you want the recipe to have. We usually veer on the side of caution and go with one chipotle pepper, and it’s perfect that way. You’ll also want 1 tablespoons adobo sauce.\n*   **Olive oil:** You’ll need a bit of olive oil to add to the marinade. Since the marinade contains plenty of oil, I usually don’t spray my grill pan before cooking the chicken.\n*   **Red Wine Vinegar:** Goes into the chipotle marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Honey:** Adds a hint of sweetness to the marinade.\n*   **Seasonings:** You’ll need onion powder, oregano, salt, and peppers. Most of these will go into the marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Corn:** I like to use a bag of frozen corn that I’ll just zap in the microwave. Fresh corn that you char on the grill would be a dream if you’re making this during the summer. It’s one of my favorite additons to this [salad](https://littlespicejar.com/charred-corn-avocado-salad/).\n*   **Onions and Garlic:** Red onions go into the corn salsa, and the garlic is for the marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Peppers and cilantro:** I use a couple of different kinds of peppers. You’ll need a small poblano pepper and a jalapeño pepper. I usually remove all the ribs and seeds from the jalapeño before mincing it up. You’ll also want to char your poblano and remove the skin. This is optional, but I do think it gives the salsa a smokey, delicious flavor! You’ll also need a handful of cilantro to add to the corn salsa.\n*   **Lemon and Limes:** You’ll need both lemons and limes to add to the corn salsa.\n*   **Base and Toppings:** You’ll need cooked rice, quinoa, or your favorite grains to make the bowl. You’ll also need ripe avocados that are diced or sliced. I used regular fluffed brown rice, but you could also make this with [cilantro lime rice](https://littlespicejar.com/cilantro-lime-rice/) or [Mexican rice](https://littlespicejar.com/mexican-rice/) for more flavor!\n\n![chicken in marinade and grilled chicken](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-2-710x532.jpg)\n\n![corn salsa in bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\nHow to make honey chipotle chicken bowls\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Start with the marinade.** Add the minced chipotle peppers, adobo, vinegar, honey, oil, garlic, onion powder, oregano, salt, and pepper to a jar and shake or whisk it to combine. Pour the marinade over the chicken and let sit for at little as 30 minutes and, ideally, around 4 hours.\n2.  **Char the peppers.** While the chicken is marinating, you’ll want to cook the rice or grains; you’ll also want to char the peppers and prepare the corn salsa. Place the poblano over an open flame on the stove and keep a close eye on it. You’ll hear the pepper start to pop. The heat blisters the skin, chars, and loosens it. Keep cooking until charred all over. Then place it in a bowl and cover with a lid for 10 minutes before you peel it with a spoon. Then mince the pepper.\n3.  **Make corn salsa.** Add the defrosted corn, minced poblano, jalapeño, cilantro, red onions, lemon, and lime juice to a bowl. Stir to combine and season with a pinch of salt. Cover and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve the bowls.\n4.  **Cook the chicken.** Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook them for 8-10 minutes, flipping the chicken in the skillet around the halfway mark. When the chicken is done, remove it to a cutting board and let it rest for several minutes before you slice or dice it.\n5.  **Assemble and serve.** Serve up the fluffy rice, tender quinoa, or grains in a bowl topped with diced chicken, a scoop of corn salsa, and slices of avocado. And feel free to top it with chopped tomatoes, hot sauce, [pickled onions](https://littlespicejar.com/quick-pickled-onions/), or other fresh veggies!\n\n![chipotle chicken, rice avocados and corn salsa in bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-8-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### FAQs about this recipe\n\n****Are honey chipotle chicken bowls a good recipe for meal prep?**​**\n\nYes! The chicken is uber-flavorful and will easily last in the refrigerator for 4 days. I recommend placing the chicken and rice in [containers](https://amzn.to/3vFwJA6) and keeping the corn salsa separate. Add the corn salsa and the avocado to each bowl right before serving.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Honey Harissa Chicken Bowls](https://littlespicejar.com/honey-harissa-chicken-bowls/)\n*   [Steak Fajita Bowls with Garlic Lime Rice](https://littlespicejar.com/steak-fajita-bowls/)\n*   [​Beef Birria de Res](https://littlespicejar.com/birria-de-res/)\n*   [Mexican Street Corn Chicken Tacos](https://littlespicejar.com/mexican-street-corn-chicken-tacos/)\n*   [Creamy Mexican Corn Dip](https://littlespicejar.com/creamy-mexican-corn-dip-elotes-dip/)\n\n![hand holding bowl with chicken and toppings](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-9-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![honey chipotle chicken bowls with brown rice, avocados, and corn salsa](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-1-735x1103.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Bowls:\n\n*   1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken (thighs/breasts/tenders)\n*   1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (plus 1 tbsp adobo)\n*   1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar\n*   1 tablespoon honey\n*   3 tablespoons olive oil\n*   2 small garlic cloves, minced\n*   ½ teaspoon EACH: onion powder AND dried oregano\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   ¼ teaspoon pepper\n*   2 ½ cups prepared rice, quinoa, or grains\n*   Lime wedges and cilantro, for serving\n*   Slices avocados, for serving\n\n#### Corn Salsa:\n\n*   1 (16-ounce) bag frozen corn\n*   ⅓ cup red onion, finely chopped\n*   1 large poblano pepper, charred, peeled and finely chopped\n*   1 jalapeño pepper, finely minced\n*   ¼ cup cilantro, chopped\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon juice AND lime juice\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **COMBINE:** Mince the chipotle peppers finely and add to a mason jar.

    "markdown": "# 10-Minute Peach & Burrata Salad - Well Seasoned Studio\nIf there’s one dish we have on repeat all summer long, it’s for sure this light, refreshing **peach burrata salad!** Stone fruit season lasts roughly from June till September, so make this as often as you can — even though peaches are available year round in most places, they are **sweetest and juiciest** while in season! **Combine fresh peaches with room temperature burrata cheese** (room temp is key!) **and thinly sliced prosciutto**. This on its own would be heaven, but we’re adding **truffle oil** which makes this a next level peach salad, m’kay!\n\nHere’s why we love this salad so much:\n\n*   Makes for an **easy, light lunch!** It won’t weigh you down, but is so completely satisfying you’ll want to enjoy it every day!\n*   **No cooking required!** We adore a no cook lunch, especially when we’re busy.\n*   **Flavorrrr!** Fresh peaches, creamy burrata cheese, and silky prosciutto — when combined together, well… _swoon!_ Because there are so few ingredients, buy high quality for the best flavor.\n*   **Truffle oil!** Adding a drizzle of truffle oil to the salad is the perfect _je ne sais quoi_ that brings the ingredients together harmoniously. Finish it all off with flaky sea salt and black pepper, and you’ve got one hell of a salad!\n\nBe sure to try our [Grilled Peach Salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-peach-salad/) next or check out all our **[easy salad recipes](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/recipes/salad/).** If you’ve got any leftover peaches, give our [Peach Crumble](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/peach-crumble/) a try for dessert!\n\n![Ingredients for peach burrata truffle salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ingredients-for-peach-burrata-truffle-salad-683x1024.jpeg)\n\nIngredient Notes\n----------------\n\n*   Ripe peaches, _either freestone or clingstone_\n*   Burrata cheese, _room temperature_\n*   Prosciutto (_optional, but highly recommended!_)\n*   [Truffle oil](https://amzn.to/3xtHbcG)\n*   Basil\n*   [Flaky sea salt](https://amzn.to/3gDkoV0)\n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n\nYou can use any type of peach you like best (or just grab whatever is ripe and smells sweetest at the store!). When you’re making a dish with so few ingredients, it’s important to select high quality items. Make sure the peaches aren’t bruised or discolored. Buy fresh, creamy burrata cheese. And if you can get prosciutto from an Italian deli (or even behind the deli counter!), it’ll be 10x better than what comes in a package.\n\n![How to assemble a peach salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/How-to-assemble-a-peach-salad-1024x1020.jpg)\n\nHow To Make An Epic Peach Burrata Salad\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cut the peaches.** If using a **freestone peach**, use a knife to cut all the way around the fruit, ensuring that the knife is touching the pit the entire time. Use your hands to separate the halves from each other, then gently lift away the pit and discard. Cut each peach halve into slices about ½” thick. If using a **clingstone peach**, you’ll cut the peach the same way, but the pit will be more stubborn to remove. Use a [paring knife](https://amzn.to/3q5nQMx) to help separate the pit from the flesh of the peach, then pull the pit out and discard.\n2.  **Arrange the prosciutto.** Rip the prosciutto into small pieces, then arrange nestled in between the peaches.\n3.  **Rip the burrata.** Use your hands to gently tear the burrata into small bite size pieces, being careful to keep a bit of the creamy filling with each bite. Scatter around the plate.\n4.  **Season the salad.** Drizzle the entirely plate lightly with about 1 Tbsp of truffle oil (a little goes a long way), then season the peach slices and burrata with flaky sea salt and black pepper. Garnish with a few fresh basil leaves, then serve immediately.\n\n![Peach and burrata salad with prosciutto on a gray plate with fork.](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Peach-and-burrata-salad-with-prosciutto-on-a-gray-plate-with-fork.jpg)\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n**Freestone vs Clingstone peaches — what’s the difference?**\n\nThis refers to how much the fruit clings to the stone, or pit, of the peach. Freestone peaches have pits that easily life away, while clingstone peaches hold onto the pit more. For a sweet peach that you can eat out of hand, look for a **freestone.** Once exposed, the put will fall away easily. **Clingstone,** however, are sweeter and juicier!\n\n**What is burrata cheese?**\n\nIt’s a soft cow’s milk cheese that looks deceptively like mozzarella. In fact, that’s what the outer layer is! The inside is filled with straciatella and cream, and has a luxurious soft, wet texture. Check out our [braised beef pappardelle](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/braised-beef-pappardelle/), [burrata pizza](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/burrata-pizza/), and [grilled potato salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-potato-salad/), all featuring our favorite cheese: burrata!\n\n**Can I use mozzarella in place of burrata?**\n\nMozzarella won’t have the same creamy texture, but of course you can use it! We recommend tearing a freshly made ball of mozzarella into small bite size pieces. The pre-shredded or packaged cheeses won’t be as good here.\n\n**Truffle oil is expensive. Can I use something else?**\n\nThe truffle oil is really the signature flavor of this dish, so we think it’s worth it. If you don’t like or can’t find truffle oil, replace with a generous drizzle of a high quality finishing oil. [This](https://amzn.to/3iWPOsp) is our favorite!\n\n![Peach salad with basil and prosciutto on a plate](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Peach-salad-with-basil-and-prosciutto-on-a-plate-683x1024.jpg)\n\n**[Don’t forget to pin this for later!](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/24699497946669429/)**\n\nNot sure how many times we need to say this, but _damn,_ is this salad amazing!

Try this parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower! It’s got lots of flavor from the pesto and a nice salty bite from the parmesan cheese. Plus, you only need four ingredients to make it!_\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a plate with a bowl of pesto.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201360%201941'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n_This recipe and photos have been updated since the original post on 2/22/2017_\n\nThere’s about a 50/50 chance you’ll get a side dish with dinner at our house. If we have company there’s a good chance you’ll get one, but if it’s just me and my husband not so much. \n\nI have been trying to be better about it. My go-to side dish is generally some kind of roasted vegetable, like these [chili honey lime roasted brussels sprouts](https://reciperunner.com/chili-honey-lime-roasted-brussels-sprouts/) or this [sweet and spicy roasted butternut squash](https://reciperunner.com/sweet-spicy-roasted-butternut-squash/).\n\nWhatever side dish I’m making it has to be easy and something that will taste good the next day so I can repurpose it with another meal. This parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower checks both of those boxes and the flavor is next level!\n\n ![ingredients for Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201360%201922'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n**Ingredients For Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Cauliflower\n*   Pesto\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Lemon\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower with a bowl of pesto with a spoon in it.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201360%201944'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nThis side dish couldn’t be easier to make. Start by preheating your oven to 400° F. Rinse and dry the head of cauliflower and then cut out the core. Break it down into florets and put them on a rimmed sheet pan.\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with any cleanup, line your sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Lay the cauliflower florets onto the sheet pan. \n\nDollop on 3 or 4 tablespoons of pesto depending on how large your head of cauliflower was. Sprinkle with salt and pepper as well. \n\nUse clean hands to toss the cauliflower until all the florets are coated with pesto. Spread them out into a single layer and make sure there is some space in between them. This will allow them to brown and caramelize rather than steam.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201360%201991'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nRoast the pesto cauliflower for 10 minutes and then remove it from the oven. Use a spatula to toss it around and then sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Roast for another another 12-15 minutes or until it’s tender and caramelized.\n\nRemove it from the oven and squeeze the juice of half of a lemon all over it. Put it on a serving platter or in a bowl. I like to scrape up any of the crispy parmesan cheese that’s stuck to the pan and add it in. \n\nDollop on additional pesto and sprinkle on extra parmesan cheese if you’d like. \n\n ![spoon drizzling pesto on top of Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201360%201999'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n**Tips For Roasting Cauliflower**\n---------------------------------\n\n*   Roast the cauliflower at a high heat. I like to roast mine at 400° F., but you can also roast at 425° F. Just keep an eye on it as it likely won’t take as long to roast.\n*   Slice the cauliflower so that there are plenty of flat edges. Make sure the flat edges are in contact with the bottom of the pan. This will ensure that they get golden brown and caramelized on that side.\n*   Don’t overcrowd the pan. If the cauliflower is too close together or on top of each other it will steam and won’t get any of the crisp edges or caramelization.\n*   Be sure the cauliflower is completely coated in oil or in this case pesto. Pesto contains olive oil which is why I didn’t add any additional oil to this recipe. \n*   Flip the florets over with a spatula halfway through the cooking time. This will help to caramelize more surface area of the florets.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto.

It’s got all the right flavors, textures, and the perfect creamy dressing to finish it all off. \n\nWe enjoy this salad as a side dish, but it can be made into a main course meal by adding in some protein. Grilled and chopped chicken, thinly sliced steak, or even some lentils or quinoa would add plenty of protein and make it filling enough for a full meal. In fact, one of our favorite ways to enjoy Blackberry Salad is with some shredded rotisserie chicken added in.\n\n ![Ingredients being added into a blender jar, processed until smooth, with poppy seeds mixed in, and the final dressing being poured.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad tips\n---------------------\n\n*   When serving Blackberry Salad for a party, event, or holiday meal, I recommend **making the candied pecans and dressing a day or two in advance**. This makes the final assembly a breeze! It’s also a good idea so the pecans have sufficient time to harden and the dressing has a chance to thoroughly chill and for the flavors to intensify.\n*   Use a **good mayonnaise for the dressing–** the better the mayo, the better the dressing will taste. I love Hellman’s/Best Foods® (not sponsored) since it has a rich flavor without being too sweet or tangy.\n*   If you aren’t able to find **fresh or ripe pears** at the store, use whole canned pears and drain them. Thinly slice and use in the salad.\n*   Speaking of ripe pears, you can **test a pear for ripeness** by applying gentle pressure near the stem end. If there is a slight give, it is most likely ready to be sliced and added to the salad. And if you can’t smell any sweet pear-ness, it probably isn’t ready to use.\n*   If you have a fresh lemon on hand, squeeze a bit of **lemon juice on the pear to keep it from browning too quickly**. [Here are a few more tips for preparing the pears](https://usapears.org/pear-ripening-and-handling/).\n\n ![Thin slices of pears and fresh blackberries prepared for a salad, with added feta cheese, leading to the salad's final assembly.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow to use leftover candied pecans\n----------------------------------\n\nSince it’s a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly halve the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nHere are some of our favorite ways to use up leftover pecans from this Blackberry Salad:\n\n*   As a **snack**/**dessert**: Enjoy them plain or coarsely chopped as a topping for a [Yogurt Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/top-10-favorite-ways-top-yogurt-bowl/) or an [Acai Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/acai-bowl/)\n*   **In these sweet** **recipes**: [Carrot Cake](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-carrot-cake/) or [Carrot Cake Cupcakes](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/carrot-cake-cupcakes/)\n*   **In these savory** **recipes**: [Pear Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-pear-pomegranate-salad/), [Butternut Squash Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/butternut-squash-salad/), our favorite [Berry Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/berry-salad-with-a-raspberry-vinaigrette/), or this Fall [Spinach Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spinach-salad/). \n*   **By replacing the regular pecans for candied pecans in these recipes**: [Chicken Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-salad/), [Mexican Wedding Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/mexican-wedding-cookies/), or these [Chocolate Chip Snowball Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chocolate-chip-snowball-cookies/)\n\nYou can store leftover pecans in the freezer (in an airtight container) for up to 2 months. They only need 10-15 minutes at room temperature to thaw enough to eat. (At room temperature, candied pecans last for up to 2 weeks stored in a cool and dry space.)\n\n ![Blackberry salad featuring a drizzle of poppy seed dressing over a mix of blackberries, nuts, greens, and cheese.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad storage\n------------------------\n\nBlackberry Salad doesn’t sit or store well once dressed. Once you assemble it, plan to eat it soon; otherwise, the dressing wilts the lettuce, the pears begin to brown, and the pecans soften.\n\nIf you make Blackberry Salad in advance, store all the components separately. Slice the pear and assemble the salad right before eating.\n\nMore salad recipes\n------------------\n\n*   [Beet and Goat Cheese Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/beet-and-goat-cheese-salad/) _with an orange-honey vinaigrette_\n*   [Olive Garden Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spiralized-cucumber-salad-with-olive-garden-dressing-copycat-video/) _with an Italian vinaigrette_\n*   [Chicken Taco Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-taco-salad/) _with a cilantro-lime vinaigrette_\n*   [Cucumber Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/cucumber-salad/) _with a balsamic vinaigrette_\n*   [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/) _on a spring Cobb salad_\n\n### Salad\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups (5 oz) spring lettuce mix (8 cups is loosely measured)\n*   ▢ 1 package (6 oz.) fresh blackberries\n*   ▢ 2 Anjou pears, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup chopped candied pecans (recipe for a full batch below)\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup crumbled goat or feta cheese\n\n### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup regular (full fat) mayo (I recommend Best Foods/Hellmans)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons EACH: whole milk, heavy cream, white granulated sugar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n*   ▢ pinch of sea salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds\n\n### Candied Pecans (Note 1)\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup white sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n*   ▢ 1 large egg white\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon water\n*   ▢ 1 pound pecan halves\n\n#### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   Combine all of the dressing ingredients, except the poppy seeds, in a blender and process until combined. Taste and adjust any flavors to personal preference. If you'd like a sweeter dressing, add an additional 1-2 teaspoons white sugar. Stir in the poppy seeds. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to serve. (Dressing stays good for 1 week stored in an airtight container in the fridge.)\n    \n\n#### Candied Pecans\n\n*   Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the white sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Stir to combine.\n    \n*   In another bowl, whisk the egg whites, vanilla, and water until frothy. Toss the pecans into this mixture and then remove, using a slotted spoon. Put the nuts into the sugar mixture and toss until well coated. Spread coated pecans onto a baking sheet.\n    \n*   Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are evenly browned. This takes about 45-60 minutes total. Let stand for 30-45 minutes to allow the pecans to fully cool and solidify. Coarsely chop for the salad.\n    \n\n#### For the Salad\n\n*   In a large salad bowl, toss together the spring lettuce mix and fresh (washed and completely dried) blackberries. Thinly slice pears. Add to the salad.\n    \n*   Add the chopped candied pecans, goat or feta cheese, and the dressing. (You may not want all of the dressing on the salad, so add to personal preference.) Toss and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Note 1**: Prep/cook time doesn't include the preparation of the candied pecans.\n\nSince it's a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly half the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nServing: 8servings | Calories: 181kcal | Carbohydrates: 15.7g | Protein: 2.2g | Fat: 13g | Cholesterol: 12.1mg | Sodium: 134.8mg | Fiber: 2.6g | Sugar: 12.4g\n\nWe do our best to provide accurate nutritional analysis for our recipes.

    "markdown": "# Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps. - Half Baked Harvest\nThis post may contain affiliate links, please see our [privacy policy](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/privacy-policy/) for details.\n\nThis Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wrap is the perfect wrap to enjoy for lunch or dinner. Grilled chicken wrapped up with Caesar salad tossed greens, avocado, bacon, and basil pesto. This colorful grilled chicken wrap is simple to make, wholesome, and delicious. Use leftover grilled chicken or make my spicy black pepper chicken on the grill. The wraps are great either way and yummy served warmed or chilled.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-1.jpg)\n\nCan you believe this is basically the first wrap recipe I’ve ever shared? I’ve avoided things like wraps and burritos for the longest time. And for the silliest reason…they’re hard for me to photograph. I know, how dumb, but we all have our hang-ups in life.\n\nBut I’m moving beyond and embracing wraps this summer. They feel new and exciting to me and that’s just what I need. New, fun, and exciting.\n\nI made these the very last day before heading off to LA the other week. I wasn’t planning on being able to get these done in time. But I really wanted to try so that I’d be able to share them ahead of Memorial Day weekend. And I am so glad I did! They’re perfect for using up any leftover chicken or for grilling up on Memorial Day.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-2.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients for the wraps\n\n*   4 large tortillas or gluten free tortillas\n*   grilled chicken or rotisserie chicken\n*   shredded lettuce or spinach\n*   sliced or diced avocado\n*   fresh basil (consider an herb garden on your front steps or side yard for fresh herbs year round)\n*   basil pesto\n*   cooked bacon\n*   crumbled blue cheese or shredded cheddar\n*   (If you want to add more to your wrap, red onion, cucumbers, and tomatoes would be delicious)\n\n### Here are the quick details\n\nThe recipe calls for already cooked chicken. You can use whatever you have on hand. Or make the black pepper chicken I often grill during the warm weather months.\n\nIt’s simply chicken tenders, tossed with olive oil, either cajun seasoning or fajita seasoning, and black pepper. Literally just three ingredients, but this mix is a go-to for me. I gave you the recipe in the notes section, so you can use that, or as I said, use leftover chicken.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-3.jpg)\n\nThe reason I really wanted to make these? I wanted another recipe to use [my homemade tortillas](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/homemade-flour-tortillas/) with. If you guys haven’t made these yet, please make them soon! They are far superior to anything you might find at the store.\n\nVery soft, but with deliciously charred pockets and so much flavor. They’re perfect for this style of wrap because you can really taste the tortillas.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-4.jpg)\n\n### The salad\n\nFor the salad, I made a short-cut Caesar dressing and tossed it with some shredded romaine lettuce, cubed avocado, and fresh basil.\n\nThe dressing is obviously key, it adds creaminess plus flavor to each wrap.\n\nWhen you have the salad tossed, all that’s left is to roll the wraps. As I mentioned, I used my homemade tortillas, then layered on some basil pesto, the Caesar salad, grilled chicken, bacon, and some blue cheese. If you don’t enjoy blue cheese, you can use shredded cheddar or even just crumbled feta.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-5.jpg)\n\nThen, wrap and roll burrito style.\n\nSince I used fresh grilled chicken and warm tortillas off the skillet, I didn’t feel the need to warm my wraps. But if you like, you can cook them in a skillet with a little olive oil until warmed. Or serve them chilled – either way is honestly so delicious.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-6.jpg)\n\nThese would be really nice for your Memorial Day picnics…and any other summer outings to follow.\n\nI know Creighton wishes he had his own wrap will sitting here by the pool!\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-7.jpg)\n\n_Looking for other picnic-style sandwich recipes?

This year, in an attempt to eat better, and stay on top of meals so I don’t feel as much need to snack, or binge on junk, I have started making some meal prep bowls.\n\nOne of the ones I made was this Greek Chicken Meal Prep Bowls from Damn Delicious. It was delicious. I made it a few more times, and changed it slightly by adding a few things to the marinade, etc. But I loved it so I had to share it.\n\n### Look how easy it is:\n\nMy husband works out of town a lot, and so I like to make food for him when I can so he doesn’t have to eat fast food all the time.\n\nSo these meal prep bowls have really come in handy for that as well.

You have a [marinade for the chicken](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/the-best-greek-chicken-marinade/ \"The Best Greek Chicken Marinade\"). It is a super simple to make marinade, that offers great flavors in as little as 20 minutes. I loved how flavorful this chicken turned out.\n2.  Then you have the [cucumber salad](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/greek-cucumber-salad-2/ \"Greek Cucumber Salad\"). It is a pretty simple recipe that utilizes fresh cucumbers, lemon, and seasonings. I could eat a big bowl of this by itself.\n3.  Last, there is the [tzatziki](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/tzatziki/ \"Tzatziki\"), which I think just brings the whole dish to life with the fresh flavors, and smooth creaminess.\n\nThe chicken is tender and juicy, the veggies fresh, and the flavors are awesome. I was worried the cucumbers wouldn’t stay crisp, but if you use the English cucumbers, they should be good for the 3-5 days.\n\n![Greek Bowl: Insanely delicious Greek Chicken bowl recipes.

I love these because they are divided into 3 compartments, are washable (dishwasher safe) and reusable, and come in [black](https://amzn.to/2vGSDmo) or [green](https://amzn.to/2vGwkxj), so I can make one with more garlic for me and less garlic for the husband, and we can know which is which.\n*   For additional meal prep, check out this [cookbook featuring 100+ ideas](https://amzn.to/2iRhw6T) or try this recipe for [ITALIAN CHICKEN MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) or [TACO MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   I loved this [meal prep lunch bag](https://amzn.to/2jFBXaY) for keeping things cool and organized.\n*   Meal prep with multiple people and swap to avoid eating the same thing all week.\n*   This meal is best within 3 days, but is good up to 5 days.\n*    This does NOT have to be a meal prep, it also serves as a delicious family dinner option!\n*   Start your brown rice in a [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2iIkrE0), or use something like these [Ready To Serve Rice Bowls](https://amzn.to/2jTaTTC) to speed up meal prep.\n\n### More Meal Prep Ideas\n\nOther Easy Meals you May Enjoy and could work for Meal Prep:\n\n*   [Flank Steak Sheet Pan Fajitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-flank-steak-fajitas/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Garlic Chicken](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-garlic-chicken-veggies/)\n*   [Chicken and Veggie Pitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/10-minute-grilled-chicken-protein-pitas/)\n*   [Taco Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) \n\n![Greek chicken meal prep bowls are easy to make and deliciously healthy.](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/greek-chicken-meal-prep-3-1-320x320.jpg)\n\n#### Greek Chicken\n\n*   2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts\n*   1/4 cup olive oil\n*   3 Tbs garlic minced (Note, adjust to preference)\n*   1/3 cup fresh lemon juice\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1 Tbs dried oregano\n*   1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n#### Cucumber Salad\n\n*   2 English cucumbers peeled and sliced\n*   1/3 cup lemon juice\n*   2 Tbs olive oil\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1/2 Tbs minced garlic\n*   1/2 tsp dried oregano\n\n#### Tzatziki Sauce\n\n*   1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   1 English cucumber finely diced\n*   1 tsp \\- up to 1 Tbs minced garlic adjust to garlic preference\n*   1/2 Tbs dill weed or 1 Tbs fresh dill, chopped fine\n*   1 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tsp lemon zest\n*   1/2 tsp chopped fresh mint optional\n*   Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### The Rest\n\n*   3 cups cooked brown rice\n*   1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes halved\n*   1/2 cup red onion slices\n\n*   In a large plastic zip bag, combine olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, greek yogurts and salt and pepper. Massage to mix.\n    \n*   Add chicken into the bag.\n    \n*   Massage to make sure chicken is full covered and marinate for at least 20 minutes, up to 12 hours.\n    \n*   Drain the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade.\n    \n*   In a skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat.\n    \n*   I used my [Anolon Skillet](http://amzn.to/2vGtydc) which I love because it heats evenly, is metal utensil friendly, and can be used in the oven up to 400 degrees.\n    \n*   Add chicken when it is hot, and cook, flipping part way through. Cook approximately 3-4 minutes per side. Cooking time depends on thickness and size of the chicken. Cook until internal temp is 165 degrees.\n    \n*   Remove from pan, and let cool.\n    \n*   Once cool, cut into bite sized pieces. Just make sure you let it cool, or all the juice will run out.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, make cucumber salad by chunking the cucumbers, and tossing in a bowl with the lemon juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and oregano. Set aside\n    \n*   Make tzatziki sauce by combining the Greek yogurt, cucumber, garlic, dill weed, lemon juice, lemon zest in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. And add mint (optional)\n    \n*   Refrigerate while assembling your bowls.\n    \n*   Cook brown rice according to package directions. When finished cooking, divide between meal prep containers, 1/2 cup in each container, halve cherry tomatoes, and mix with red onion slices. Divide amongst the bowls.\n    \n*   Top with chicken, cucumber salad, and some tzatziki sauce.\n    \n*   Keep for 3- 5 days in airtight container, serve cold!\n    \n\n\\* Adjust garlic to your preference. I love garlic. Cut back if you don't (in marinade and tzatziki sauce)  \nThe marinade should be drained off, you don't want to eat all that garlic, just use it to flavor your chicken.  \n\\*\\* Another great meal prep option are these [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nRecipe adapted from [Damn Delicious](http://damndelicious.net/2016/11/16/greek-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nCalories: 521kcal | Carbohydrates: 40g | Protein: 43g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 97mg | Sodium: 109mg | Potassium: 1246mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 8g | Vitamin A: 725IU | Vitamin C: 44.1mg | Calcium: 126mg | Iron: 3mg\n\nOur recipe card software calculates these nutrition facts based on averages for the above ingredients, different brands, and quality of produce/meats may have different nutritional information, always calculate your own based on the specific products you use in order to achieve accurate macros for this recipe.\n\n![](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thumbnail_App-Icon.png) Try PrePear, my FREE Meal Planning App that allows you to save your recipes, plan meals, shop for groceries, and cook simply in one place.

Well, you know it was only a matter of time before I used it in a slow cooker recipe.\n\nAnd I’m combining some favorites here. The super popular [slow cooker garlic parmesan chicken and potatoes](https://damndelicious.net/2016/05/27/slow-cooker-garlic-parmesan-chicken-potatoes/) gets a bit of a makeover with more veggies and hello, the addition of the cream sauce.\n\nSo go ahead and sear your chicken thighs (for color and for caramelization), then let it cook low and slow with your potatoes before adding your broccoli in during the last 30 minutes or so.\n\nFrom there, you’ll make your cream sauce right in the crockpot. No babysitting, no stirring. Just dump it in and you’re set – main and sides and everything.\n\n_![Slow Cooker Creamy Garlic Chicken and Veggies - A one pot crockpot meal!

CAN I SUBSTITUTE SOMETHING ELSE?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely! You can substitute oregano or rosemary (dried or fresh!) or any other herb of your choosing. And because dried herbs are often more potent/concentrated than fresh herbs, you need less when using dry. The correct ratio is 1 tablespoon fresh herbs to 1 teaspoon dried herbs.\n\n*   6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n*   1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika\n*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n*   2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n*   2 pounds baby red potatoes, halved\n*   ¼ cup white wine\n*   ¼ cup chicken stock\n*   2 shallots, chopped\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 teaspoon dried thyme\n*   3 cups broccoli florets\n*   ½ cup heavy cream\n*   1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n*   1 tablespoon cornstarch\n\n*   Season chicken with paprika, salt and pepper, to taste.\n    \n*   Melt butter in a [large cast iron skillet](https://amzn.to/3UqkJfr) over medium high heat.

Stir in wine, chicken stock, shallots, garlic and thyme; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add chicken to the slow cooker in an even layer.\n    \n*   Cover and cook on low heat for 5-6 hours, or until the chicken is completely cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Add broccoli during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.\n    \n*   Remove chicken, potatoes and broccoli from the slow cooker, cover and keep warm.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, whisk together heavy cream, lemon juice and cornstarch. Stir into the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high heat for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.\n    \n*   Serve chicken, potatoes and broccoli immediately with cream sauce.\n    \n\nPost navigation\n---------------"

I mean, who doesn’t love throwing everything into a pot that cooks itself? SIGN ME UP.\n\nA solid slow cooker recipe is what all of us need in our hip pockets. Especially one that is as crazy tasty as this!\n\nSo why do you need this Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl? Let me count the ways…\n\n*   Oh so easy! Let the slow cooker do ALL the hard work\n*   Great flavors – chicken is cooked in tomatoes, jalapeño, cilantro, lime…not lacking in the flavor department over here!\n*   Lots of textures – i.e. corn, beans, avocado, cilantro…\n*   So versatile – mix and match to create the Chicken Burrito Bowl of your dreams\n*   Leftovers! This recipe makes at least 6 servings (depending on how hungry you are) and will probably give you lunch and dinner for another day or two!\n\n![Bowl filled with chicken, corn, black beans, shredded cheese, avocados, cilantro and la wedge of lime](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-1.jpg)\n\nAnd yes, it tastes as dreamy as it looks….\n\nCooking chicken in slow cooker or crockpot\n------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, let’s talk about how to make the chicken. Think of this as a slow cooker (or some call it crockpot) chicken recipe inspired by yummy Mexican flavors, so you will find all the good stuff such as jalapeños, cumin, chili powder, and cilantro involved.\n\nThe best part is, with a crockpot and all the delicious spices/sauces we are adding, making the chicken flavorful, tender and delicious requires almost zero efforts.\n\nWell, maybe a little effort. 😉 As little as combining all the ingredients into the slow cooker.\n\nThese ingredients are:\n\n*   chicken – I used chicken breast, but chicken thighs work as well\n*   chicken broth\n*   salsa (I like to use chunky salsa, but pick your favorite!)\n*   smoked paprika\n*   cumin\n*   chili powder\n*   BRIANNAS Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nJust dump it all in the slow cooker, cover, and let it do its thing for 4 hours on high.\n\nI do want to pause and take a moment to reflect on how much I’m loving BRIANNAS salad dressings. I recently discovered that they are not just amazing salad dressings, they actually have multiple super powers.\n\n![Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing in the background](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-5.jpg)\n\nSuper power #1: makes salads taste amazing. But we know that already.\n\nSuper power #2: it’s an INCREDIBLE marinade. And works like magic in the crockpot!\n\nThat is right. Made out of quality ingredients, they make amazing marinades for your favorite protein. Like mind-blowing, over-the-fence, cannot-get-enough kind of incredible.\n\nHere’s the best part: you can search for BRIANNAS dressings near you [HERE](https://www.briannas.com/where-to-buy/) and join in the fun!\n\nThis Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing has yummy flavors of jalapeño, cilantro and lime in it, and it takes the flavors of our slow cooker chicken to the next level. In addition (because why stop there?), it also gives the sauce a slightly thicker, creamier texture.\n\nTranslation: I love this dressing; I love this Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl. Lots of love going around.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooked on high for 4 hours, shred it. You will find that the chicken will easily fall apart.\n\n![Shredding chicken in a crockpot using a pair of tongs](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-7.jpg)\n\nShredded Chicken in the crockpot\n\nNext, let the shredded chicken sit for about 10 minutes so it soaks in the yummy juices. Yum yum yum.\n\n**All the ways to serve Chicken Burrito Bowl!**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSomething else I love – the versatility of Chicken Burrito Bowl.\n\nServe the chicken with some (or all) of these yummy ingredients. Mix and match to your heart’s content. Make the Chicken Burrito Bowl of your dream.\n\nBest of all, these ingredients take little to no time to prepare:\n\n*   Rice – white or brown rice, or grab a box of Spanish rice or Mexican rice!\n*   Beans\n*   Corn\n*   Avocado\n*   Cheese\n*   Tortilla Chips\n*   Tomatoes\n*   Pico de Gallo\n*   My [Quick 15 Minutes Queso](https://www.joyousapron.com/easy-15-minute-queso-cheese-dip/)\n*   My [Homemade Guacamole](https://www.joyousapron.com/homemade-chunky-guacamole/)\n*   Jalapeños, if you like it spicy!\n\nSqueeze some lime juice onto the bowl, drizzle it with more BRIANNAS’ Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nDIG IN and enjoy that lovely Chicken Burrito Bowl that you just tailor made for yourself!\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing on the side](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-3.jpg)\n\nFlavorful, so much texture, pretty healthy, and so much going on in a simple bowl. I adore this delicious Chicken Burrito Bowl made in the slow cooker, and I have a suspicion that you would too!\n\nTips and Tricks\n---------------\n\nHere are some additional tips and tricks when making Chicken Burrito Bowl using the crockpot:\n\n*   When shredding the chicken, use a pair of tongs and fork to shred it. It should come apart really easily!\n*   Taste the chicken after you shred it, and if needed add salt to open up the flavors. I did not add salt, but whether salt is needed will depend on the chicken broth and/or salsa used.\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-4.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can you freeze Slow Cooker Chicken?**\n\nAbsolutely! Store in an airtight container in either the refrigerator or freezer. If you are storing it in the refrigerator, consume within 5 days. They store really well and make great leftovers and meal prep! Store ingredients separately and tailor make your Chicken Burrito Bowl when ready to eat!\n\n**How do I make the chicken in the Instant pot?**\n\nPressure cook on high for 15 minutes in the Instant Pot.\n\n**How do I make this low carb?**\n\nUse cauliflower rice instead of white or brown rice.\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS RECIPE?

All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\n\n![Post Image](https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,g_center,w_730,h_913/k%2Farchive%2Ff33558b0c4da039b6315aa4ada2aa09939f2cad7)\n\nThis is my absolute favorite kind of [slow cooker recipe](https://www.thekitchn.com/slow-cooker-recipes-23076631) — one that takes less than five minutes to pull together and then rewards you with a delicious, healthy dinner at the end of the day. These burrito bowls are **full of chili-spiced [brown rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice-113856), [black beans,](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-black-bean-recipes-227509) [corn](https://www.thekitchn.com/corn-recipes-259912), and yes, tender bites of [shredded chicken](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-shredded-chicken-in-the-slow-cooker-231481)**. Everything gets cooked right in the pot, so all you need to do is dish yourself a bowl and sprinkle with cheese.\n\nTwo Stages of the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nI usually do this recipe in two stages. First, I get the [chicken](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-chicken-recipes-261543) going with some [broth](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-stock-and-broth-word-of-mouth-71199) and diced tomatoes, and then I add the [rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-rice-on-the-stove-44333), [beans](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-beans-on-the-stove-182717), and corn midway through cooking. This ensures that everything finishes cooking at the same time and the beans don’t get too mushy.\n\nIf I’m going to be gone for a while and won’t be home to add the rice, I just leave it out of the slow cooker and cook it separately on the stovetop just before serving. It dirties one more pot, but it gives me some flexibility with my schedule.\n\nKeep an Eye on the Rice\n-----------------------\n\nThe first few times you make this, pay special attention to the rice. I like using [brown rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/slow-cooker-brown-rice-259084) here because it holds its shape better over longer cooking, but it can be a bit hard to judge exactly when it will be done.\n\nI use a basic grocery-store brand of rice and it typically finishes cooking in 3 1/2 hours on low in this recipe; whichever brand or variety you use, I suggest checking it after about 2 1/2 hours to see how quickly it’s cooking and if it needs more liquid. (Speaking of liquid, you’ll get some from the [canned tomatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/25-ways-to-use-canned-tomatoes-261469), so you won’t need to add as much broth as you normally would if you were cooking the rice by itself. Even so, use your best judgement if you think more or less liquid is needed.)\n\nI use my small three-quart slow cooker for this recipe. It’s just big enough to fit everything at once and give the rice plenty of room to expand as it cooks. If you have a larger slow cooker, I’d suggest doubling the recipe and freezing half for other meals.\n\nWays To Enjoy the Chicken Burrito Bowl\n--------------------------------------\n\nOne of the best things about this recipe, aside from how easy it is to make, is the way all the flavors and ingredients mingle during cooking. The chicken cooks in a tomato-rich, cumin-spiked broth, which then gets absorbed by the rice later on. Every bite ends up deeply seasoned and fragrant with spices.\n\nEat it in a bowl with slices of [avocado](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-slice-an-avocado-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-200500) and a dollop of [sour cream](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-sour-cream-23386619), or roll it up in a [burrito](https://www.thekitchn.com/easy-bean-rice-burrito-recipe-23024697) for lunch. Either way, it’s a win. This simple slow-cooker meal has more than earned its spot in my regular lineup.\n\n[Comments](#comments-207333)\n\nThese chicken burrito bowls only require five minutes of hands-on prep time — the rest of the work is done by your slow cooker.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 to 1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken thighs, or a mix\n    \n*   1 (14.5-ounce) can\n    \n    diced tomatoes\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed\n    \n*   2 teaspoons\n    \n    chili powder\n    \n*   2 teaspoons\n    \n    salt\n    \n*   1 teaspoon\n    \n    ground cumin\n    \n*   1 (15-ounce) can\n    \n    black beans, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    uncooked brown rice\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    frozen corn kernels\n    \n*   _Optional toppings:_ shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, sour cream, diced avocado, salsa, hot sauce, diced green onions, shredded lettuce\n    \n\n1.  Combine the chicken, diced tomatoes and their juices, chicken broth, chili powder, salt, and cumin in a 2 1/2- to 3 1/2-quart slow cooker. Make sure the chicken is covered with liquid, adding additional broth as needed. Cover and cook on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours.\n    \n2.  Uncover and stir in the beans, rice, and corn. Cover and continue cooking on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours more. Check the rice periodically in the last hour of cooking, stirring once or twice to make sure the rice cooks evenly and adding more chicken broth if the mixture seems dry. Cooking is done when the rice is tender — if the rice is done but there is still liquid left in the slow cooker, uncover and cook on the HIGH setting to let the liquid evaporate.\n    \n3.  Use 2 forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. You can do this either in the slow cooker itself and then mix it into the rice, or you can transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board if you prefer to keep it separate. Taste and stir in more salt or other seasonings as needed. Serve burrito bowls with a selection of toppings.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Cooking the rice separately:** If you won't be home to add the rice to the slow cooker, you can skip this step and cook it separately on the stovetop just before serving (use [these directions](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice-113856)). To modify the recipe, combine the chicken, diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of stock, and spices in the slow cooker and cook for 6 to 8 hours on the LOW setting. Add the beans and corn and cook for 30 minutes more, or until warmed through, while you're cooking the rice (omit the remaining chicken broth).\n\n**Vegetarian burrito bowls:** Combine the diced tomatoes, 1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth, spices, rice, black beans, and corn in the slow cooker. Cook on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours, until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Stir once or twice toward the end of cooking to make sure the rice is cooking evenly.\n\n**Beyond burrito bowls**: Besides burrito bowls, you can use this filling to make regular tortilla-wrapped burritos or [freezer burritos](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-i-make-burritos-to-freeze-freezer-friendly-from-jessica-fisher-198682).\n\n**Storage:** The burrito mixture will keep for 1 week refrigerated or for 3 months in the freezer."

    "markdown": "# Slow Cooker Italian Beef Ragu - Vikalinka\n_**This rustic Italian Beef Ragu requires minimum skill or effort as it is made easily in a slow cooker. The rich and chunky ragu is packed with vibrant flavour and is so satisfying to eat. Use it with pasta or in lasagna and freeze the rest!**_\n\nNot planning to use a slow cooker? Check out my [Tuscan Ragu](https://vikalinka.com/tuscan-ragu/)!\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a piece of chunky bread and a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-3-Edit.jpg)\n\nI am going to admit openly that I am not a big fan of crock pots. Mine doesn’t get used very often, mostly because I enjoy the cooking process and am too much of a control freak to let the slow cooker take over.\n\nI also find meals cooked in a crock pot taste too similar to each other. They taste like stew. I like stew but not every day of the week.\n\nI am however, a HUGE fan of tender, melt-in-your-mouth, big and bold flavour meat. And if a slow cooker has to take the centre stage for this to happen, so be it. I suppose I can share the limelight…for one day.\n\n![Bowl of pasta in beef ragu](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-23-Edit.jpg)\n\nHave you ever had a really tasty and satisfying Italian beef ragu at your favourite Italian restaurant? I am talking about rich and satisfying meat based tomato sauce that’s been cooked for hours allowing for deep flavours to build and blend into a beautiful medley.\n\nI really love rustic dishes that look scruffy and taste earthy. While this may not exactly be food art it is a beautiful sight nonetheless. And I can’t even begin to describe how tender and flavourful this ragu is!\n\nTruth is, not all incredible food needs to be high cuisine. Sometimes all we need is kick-ass flavour to turn dinner into something special.\n\nAnd this ragu has heaps of flavour, with savoury beef, sweet and acidic tomatoes and rich red wine. Truly this is the king of pasta sauces!\n\n![close up of beef ragu in a pot](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MG_1602-3-682x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat is Italian Beef Ragu?\n--------------------------\n\nJust imagine a 4 pound hunk of beef smothered in plum Italian tomatoes, fresh rosemary and thyme. Then it is sprinkled with salt and pepper and minced garlic and drowned in half a bottle of Chianti. It is then left simmering slowly for 12…that’s right, 12 hours over low heat.\n\nHow can it not taste divine?\n\nItalian Beef Ragu and Bolognese sauces are twins but not exactly the same. There are differences but they are so subtle that many Italians use the words interchangeably.\n\nThe main characteristic of the beef ragu is it’s heavily meat-based sauce. If you see more meat than tomato, you’ve got yourself a proper Italian beef ragu.\n\nThe bold taste of this sauce will leave you gobsmacked. I mean in a complete disbelief that you barely lifted a finger for this awesomeness to come out of your kitchen. Crock pot, you win.\n\nBeef ragu pasta\n---------------\n\nYou are probably wondering how to eat this delicious sauce. Well, seeing that it’s Italian I served it with pappardelle pasta and and generous grating of parmesan cheese.\n\nActually you can serve this beef ragu with any pasta of your choice.  Just bear in mind that it’s a robust sauce, so your pasta should match it.\n\nNo delicate capellini or even spaghetti will do quite as well.  It will, however, taste great with rigatoni, penne or any other sturdy pasta.\n\n![Top down of a bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-25-Edit-2.jpg)\n\nRecipe tips and notes\n---------------------\n\n*   Because of the slow cooking process and the number of other flavours added to the beef, there isn’t a lot of benefit in buying an expensive cut of meat. This is a good recipe to save money on a cheap cut of meat, which will become tender and flavourful as it cooks.\n*   The red wine is an amazing source of flavour for a ragu and I always keep a bottle on hand to use in recipes like this. If you don’t want to cook with wine, it can be replaced with beef stock.\n*   Barley is optional, but is a great way to thicken the ragu while adding nutrition. Barley doesn’t add a lot of flavour beyond a subtle nuttiness, but makes the ragu creamier by releasing starch during the cooking process.\n*   A hearty pasta sauce needs a hearty pasta, so choose a thick pasta like pappardelle, fettuccine or tagliatelle.\n\nServing suggestions\n-------------------\n\nServing this ragu with pasta may be the most obvious way to go, but it also could be the best. The rich sauce and chunks of beef coat pasta beautifully, especially when using a thick and hearty pasta like pappardelle or tagliatelle.\n\nIt’s a rich pasta sauce, so is at its best when paired with something lighter that can cut through the beef. My go-to is a [caprese salad](https://vikalinka.com/tomato-salad-basil-mozzarella-caprese/) with sweet tomatoes and fresh basil, but a simple green salad will also do nicely. I also love adding [garlic bread](https://vikalinka.com/air-fryer-garlic-bread/) to soak up any remaining sauce.\n\nAlthough this delicious beef ragu is Italian by origin don’t let it stop you from serving it with anything you can think of. At the end of our dinner tonight, we all agreed this meat would taste absolutely amazing in a burrito, served on top of rice or even with some potatoes.\n\nStorage and leftovers\n---------------------\n\nThis Italian beef ragu incredibly versatile and because you cook a whole roast you are bound to have lots of leftovers.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to use leftover ragu other than serving it with pasta. I’ve actually used it in two different recipes: [Rustic Three Cheese Lasagna](https://vikalinka.com/2014/05/12/rustic-three-cheese-lasagna/) and [Italian Beef and Roasted Red Pepper Quesadillas](https://vikalinka.com/2014/03/19/italian-beef-and-roasted-red-pepper-quesadillas-with-tomato-and-basil-salsa/).\n\nThis ragu freezes absolutely beautifully!  And let me tell you, you will be so pleased to find a container of this goodness on a night when you can’t possibly face spending a long time in the kitchen!\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a piece of chunky bread and a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-3-Edit-320x320.jpg)\n\nCrock Pot Rustic Italian Beef Ragu\n----------------------------------\n\nRich Italian beef ragu slowly simmered in your slow cooker for maximum flavour.

The long and slow cooking time makes all the flavors meld well. This is in addition to the rich combination of spices included in the marinade, make this dish irresistible.\n\nMy family and I discovered this dish while visiting India years ago, and we all loved it. Of course, I had to try and make it. And if I do say so myself, the results are even better than the one we tried! The trick to this recipe is the slow cooker. Letting it do all the work for you while you go on your day is awesome, and you get to return to a delicious meal at the end of the day!\n\nI start by marinating my chicken the night before. Just leave it in the fridge to soak up all the flavors. Then, before I leave for the day, I sauté it and put it in the slow cooker with the sauce to cook while I am out. If you need your chicken sooner, you can cook it on high for three to four hours. However, for the best flavor and most tender chicken, I recommend cooking on low for six to seven hours.\n\nWhy you will love this recipe\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **It is so easy:** Marinate the chicken the night before. Then sauté the chicken and toss it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients before enjoying your day. Then, you can come back to a delicious but easy meal.\n*   **Authentic flavor:** If your goal is to serve an authentic Indian meal, this one you should definitely try.\n*   **Leftovers taste incredible:** Some recipes taste better the next day. This crockpot butter chicken is one of them. Save some for lunch or dinner tomorrow.\n*   **Make it your way:** Although I prefer this dish just the way it is, sometimes I like to mix it up by adding or removing some of the ingredients. For example, when I have people sensitive to spicy foods, I leave out chili powder and garam masala.\n\n![a wooden spoon with creamy Indian butter chicken](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals3-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nWhat you’ll need to make slow cooker butter chicken\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Special items:\n\n*   **Slow cooker** – Whether you have a slow cooker or crockpot, the directions are the same.\n*   **Large skillet** – For sautéing the chicken. \n*   **Wooden spoon –** I prefer wooden utensils because they do not scratch the ceramic in my slow cooker.\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n*   **Chicken –** I use skinless boneless chicken thighs because they are easy to prepare, and my family prefers white meat. Whatever meat you use, just cut it into two-inch cubes.\n*   **Yogurt**—Plain Greek yogurt is my preference for this marinade. It adds a nice, mellow acid with a mild, creamy flavor.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Garlic powder**—I put garlic powder in just about everything, and it is perfect for marinating chicken because it is concentrated and will add more garlic taste.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Turmeric –** A popular curry spice, turmeric adds an earthy background with hints of pepper, ginger, and sweetness. Some say it tastes similar to mustard. It can also be somewhat bitter if you use too much.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red chili powder and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your marinade a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer to use sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n\n### For the sauce:\n\n*   **Olive oil –** I always use extra virgin olive oil because it is light and has a mild flavor**.** In this recipe, it is used to sauté the chicken.\n*   **Butter**—Because butter is the star of this dish, I only use the highest-quality butter without salt. If your butter has salt, remove it from the sauce ingredients.\n*   **Onion –** Minced and sauteed to add a fresh onion flavor without any bitterness that the powder has.\n*   **Garlic –** Also minced and sauteed, fresh garlic gives your sauce a deep, rich garlic taste.\n*   **Tomato sauce**—Another important ingredient. I prefer to use organic tomatoes to make my own, but you can use your favorite brand.\n*   **Evaporated milk –** Any kind of evaporated milk will do, but the better the quality, the better the flavor.\n*   **Heavy cream**—Do not substitute this ingredient unless you really have to because it gives your sauce the creaminess it needs to taste authentic.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your sauce a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n*   **Black pepper –** Grind your own from fresh peppercorns for the best taste.\n*   **Sugar –** I use granulated white sugar for sweetness, but you could use honey or maple syrup.\n\nHow to make slow cooker butter chicken?\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** The night before (or at least 30 minutes before), mix all of the marinade ingredients in a heavy-duty zipper baggie and add chicken. Put it in the fridge to marinate.\n2.  **Sauté the chicken:** When ready to begin, heat a large skillet with oil over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add chicken in batches so you don’t crowd the pan. Cook for about three to five minutes, or until it is brown on each side. Set it aside on a plate and cover with foil.\n3.  **Make the sauce:** Now, add the butter to the pan and let it melt before adding the garlic, onion, and ginger. Continue to stir and cook for two minutes. Add the paprika, sugar, red chili powder, garam masala, and cumin, and cook for another minute.\n4.  **Transfer to the pot:** Next, pour the sauce into your slow cooker and stir in the chicken. Add the evaporated milk and tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste.\n5.  **Cook the chicken:** Turn your pot to low and cook for six to seven hours or on high for three to four hours. About 30 minutes before the cooking time is up, stir in the heavy cream.\n6.  **Serve:** Finally, serve your butter chicken with whatever side dishes you like.\n\nExpert tip\n----------\n\n### Finding your own garam masala\n\nBecause there are many different garam masala blends, it is good to find your favorite before you cook with it. The most common variety is made with black peppercorns, green and black cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and mace. Some other types have fennel seeds, bay leaves, coriander, and chili powder. Others have only pepper, cloves, cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom.\n\nAll varieties and blends of garam masala are considered authentic Indian spices, so it is up to you to decide which mixture you prefer. Kosher garam masala has organic pepper, coriander, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom. Each spice, such as cardamom and fennel, can be ground into a powder or left as whole seeds or pods.\n\nBiryani masala is another variety of spices made with caraway seeds and anise. Another kind you may see on the market is chaat masala, which has dried mango powder added for a bit of sweet tanginess. You can also make your own, so you only get the spices you like and the right amounts.\n\n![slow cooker butter chicken served with rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals5-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nRecipe variations and add-ins:\n------------------------------\n\n*   **Different cuts:** Instead of skinless boneless chicken breast, you could also use thighs. Dark meat has a more robust flavor and is always juicy.\n*   **Different meat:** If your butcher does not have fresh organic chicken, you could use a different meat. I have tried pork, turkey. They are all truly delicious in their way.\n*   **Cheesy butter chicken:** Another way to change this recipe is to add some shredded cheese. I have tried cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.\n*   **Make it spicy:** Even with the garam masala and chili powder, this dish is not that spicy. If you want to add some heat, add red pepper flakes to the marinade and toss chopped jalapenos into the sauce.\n\nServing suggestions:\n--------------------\n\nSlow-cooker butter chicken goes great with all sorts of side dishes. Here are some ideas my family loves:\n\n*   To make this a whole meal in one pot, add some baby red potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.\n*   I like to serve my saucy butter chicken on top of some [perfect fluffy rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/how-to-cook-perfect-rice-in-the-instant-pot/) and garlic naan on the side.\n*   Any kind of side dish would pair nicely with this dish, but for an Indian theme, try it with chutney, chana masala, naan, or [grilled eggplant](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-eggplant-recipe/).\n*   Add a light salad on the side, like this [strawberry broccoli salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/strawberry-broccoli-salad-recipe/) or [grilled zucchini salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-zucchini-salad-recipe/).\n*   To help soak that delicious sauce, serve with some crusty French bread or rolls like my [Amish potato dinner rolls](https://urls.grow.me/https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/amish-potato-dinner-rolls-recipe/%23growSource=search&growReferrer=true).\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Why is my slow cooker butter chicken watery?\n\nFirst, the most common reason for watery butter chicken is too much liquid. That may be the obvious thing, but many people overlook it. Keep an eye on your measuring to make sure the amounts are all correct. Another problem could be that you added the cream and butter too soon. Try waiting for the sauce to cool before adding them. Thicken up your sauce with a bit of cornstarch slurry.\n\n### How long do I cook chicken in a slow cooker?\n\nThe time to cook chicken in a slow cooker depends on the cut of meat and how large it is. If you are cooking a whole chicken, you may have to let it cook for six hours on low or up to nine hours on high. Chicken breasts can be finished in six or seven hours on low or three to four on high. Chopped chicken, like in this dish, can cook even faster, so make sure you check the internal temp early. Once it reaches 160 degrees F, you can shut off the crockpot, which will continue to cook, reaching 165 degrees F quickly.\n\n### How do I make my butter chicken tender?\n\nNo chicken should be chewy or rubbery, but it happens sometimes. It can happen if your chicken was not cooked long enough or when it is cooked too long. You have to get it to the correct temperature for eating, which is 165 degrees F, without going over that number. Using the marinade in this recipe should keep your chicken from drying out, especially since you are cooking it low and slow in a creamy sauce.\n\n### Why did my butter chicken sauce crack?\n\nGetting the sauce perfect can be difficult if you do not follow the directions carefully. If you overcook it after adding the butter, it will separate. If it simmers too long, the water can evaporate, and the sauce will dry and crack. Another thing to be careful of is to add the yogurt while it is not too hot, or it will curdle. The same goes for the cream. Do not mix the cream in until the last step so it will blend seamlessly. \n\n![crockpot butter chicken with a wooden spoon into the mixture](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals2-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nHow to store:\n-------------\n\n*   **Refrigerate:** After cooled to room temperature, put your crockpot butter chicken in a sealed container. It will stay fresh for up to 10 days. \n*   **Freezing:** If you want to keep it longer, you must freeze it. Once it has cooled, pour it into a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, and it can stay frozen for four to six months. \n*   **Defrost:** Remove your frozen leftovers from the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you plan to serve them.\n*   **Reheating:** Heat in a saucepan on the stove for 10 minutes or in the microwave for one or two minutes. \n\nRecipe tips:\n------------\n\n*   To easily remove cardamom pods after cooking, use a needle and thread to tie them together. Then, before serving, lift the thread out to remove all the pods at once.\n*   If your chicken is too thin, add some cornstarch slurry and heat it a little longer. You can make a slurry by mixing one tablespoon of cornstarch with one cup of warm water.\n*   If it has an acid taste, add another tablespoon of sugar or honey.\n*   I usually double the sauce recipe because I like to use it when reheating. It also tastes great on tacos, pasta, and bread.\n*   When freezing, put your leftovers in small freezer-safe containers to take out just what you need when you need it.\n\nSlow Cooker Butter Chicken is made with tender, perfectly seasoned chicken and a rich curry sauce made with tomato and cream. This combination is nothing short of mouthwateringly delicious and so easy to make—the slow cooker does all the work. \n\n![image of slow cooker butter chicken](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals1-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\n### Chicken Marinade:\n\n*   ▢ 2 lbs chicken breasts or thighs cut into 2-inch cubes\n*   ▢ 1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon fresh minced ginger\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon garam masala\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon turmeric\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon of salt\n\n### Sauce:\n\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons butter\n*   ▢ 1 large onion diced\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic minced\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon ginger minced\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garam masala\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon sugar\n*   ▢ 14 oz tomato sauce\n*   ▢ 1 1/4 teaspoons salt or to taste\n*   ▢ 1 cup evaporated milk\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup heavy cream\n\n### Chicken Marinade:\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    In a bowl or large ziplock bag, combine chicken pieces with all of the MARINADE ingredients, cover with plastic wrap, and let marinate for 30 minutes or overnight in the fridge.\n    \n\n### Saute the Chicken:\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    Place a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Just like my awesome [15-Minute Queso (Cheese Dip)](https://www.joyousapron.com/easy-15-minute-queso-cheese-dip/) recipe, which seem like a complete different food item, but in many ways it is not, chicken broth brings another dimension of flavor to the creamy sauce and elevates it.\n*   Creamy but not crazy heavy – this is a creamy and thick potato dish, but not so much that the cream overpower the potatoes. I like to think that the creaminess and cheese enhances the scalloped potatoes, and not overtake it completely.\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nHere is the full ingredient list to make cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n*   potatoes – My favorite potatoes to use for cheesy scalloped potatoes are Yukon gold potatoes, russets or Idaho. Basically middle to high starch potatoes are perfect for this.\n*   garlic – use fresh garlic because garlic powder is just not as flavorful if you really want the garlic flavors to come through.\n*   cheese – using three cheeses in this cheesy scalloped potatoes: mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan. You can opt for other cheeses as well.\n*   butter\n*   onion – sweet, yellow or white onions\n*   flour – used to thicken the sauce\n*   milk – i typically use 2% milk.\n*   chicken broth – important ingredient for another layer of flavor\n*   thyme – dried or fresh thyme works fine. Fresh will be more flavorful but it’s not necessary\n\n![A casserole of Cheesy Garlic Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-3.jpg)\n\nHow to make Garlic Scalloped Potatoes\n-------------------------------------\n\nNext, I’m going to show you how easy it is to make these cheesy scalloped potatoes!\n\n### Prepare Potatoes\n\nFirst, we are going to prepare the potatoes by slicing them into thin slices. Make sure they are nice and thin (~ 1/8 inch in thickness) so that they cook easily and soften quickly.\n\nHere are two reasons why it’s so easy to make garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n*   no boiling potatoes beforehand\n*   no peeling potatoes\n\nJust make sure you slice those potatoes super thinly and that’s all there is to it when it comes to preparing your potatoes.\n\n![Potatoes sliced thinly](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cheesy-scalloped-potatoes-683x1024.jpg)\n\n_Thinly sliced potatoes_\n\n### Prepare Cheese Sauce\n\nNext we make that delicious garlic cheese sauce, another essential part of our cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes. Gosh I love it so much.\n\nHeat a medium pot to medium heat and add butter.\n\nOnce butter is melted, add diced onions and minced garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until they are soft and fragrant.\n\nAdd flour and stir to combine. Once combined, add milk, chicken broth, thyme and salt. Whisk mixture continuously as it comes to a boil. It’s important to whisk it so that the flour clumps will dissolve.\n\nContinue stirring and cook for a few minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly.\n\nTurn off heat and add shredded cheddar, shredded mozzarella and parmesan. Stir to combine. \n\n![Making cheese sauce in a pot on stove](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cheesy-Scalloped-Potatoes-Process-Shots-1024x439.jpg)\n\nRemove from heat promptly and set aside.\n\nNext we will be layering the potatoes and cheese sauce to form a casserole dish full of cheesy scalloped potatoes.\n\n### Layer Casserole\n\nHere’s how we layer the cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n1.  place 1/3 of the potatoes in [a 9″ x 13″ casserole dish](https://www.joyousapron.com/recommends/baking-dish-rectangular/ \"Baking Dish Rectangular\")\n2.  add 1/3 of the cheese sauce\n3.  repeat 1) and 2) until everything is gone.\n\n![Adding cheese sauce to potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-1.jpg)\n\nTip: As you layer the potatoes, make sure to spread them out and cover each of them well with sauce to ensure all your cheesy scalloped potatoes are fully cooked. Potatoes not covered with sauce are more difficult to cook through and will not be as soft.\n\n### Bake casserole\n\nOnce you have three layers of potatoes and cheese sauce, send your cheesy scalloped potatoes to the oven to bake!\n\nWhen cheesy scalloped potatoes are done, they should be bubbly with a slightly golden brown top. Potatoes should be soft and coated in that rich and creamy cheese sauce.\n\n![A rectangular casserole of Cheesy Garlic Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-2.jpg)\n\nCheese. Potatoes. Cheese. Potatoes.\n\nWith garlic flavored goodness all around it.\n\nMy heart is full. My stomach is full.\n\nThe cheese on the top will be slightly brown and crusty. Dig a spoon into it, and the creamy, velvety cheese will ooze out, along with the now tender and soft slices of potatoes.\n\nOkay YUUUUMMMM.\n\nThis lovely cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes makes the best side to any main dishes. If you truly must, it can also be consumed by itself.\n\nStorage and Reheat\n------------------\n\nCheesy garlic scalloped potatoes are the perfect dish to make ahead. Storage it covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\nTo reheat, simply cover and bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes at 350℉.\n\n![Scooping out some cheesy potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-5.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can I use other cheeses?**\n\nYes! Colby jack, Monterey jack, or any of your favorite blends work great! Make sure out of the cheeses you use, some of them melts easily (soft cheeses).\n\n**Can I freeze cooked scalloped potatoes?**\n\nYes! When ready to reheat, bring it to the refrigerator the night before so that it defrost completely. Then follow the reheating instructions to reheat.\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS RECIPE?

Don’t cram the veggies in! **Why? ⇢** Giving the veggies room to breathe allows steam to escape as they bake. This helps ensure the cauliflower & sweet potatoes get nice & crispy rather than soggy.\n\n2\n\n**Roast in the oven.** Roast the cauliflower & sweet potatoes for about 25 minutes, or until they’re tender through the center & beginning to get crispy around the edges. **Roasted veggies tip! ⇢** Be sure to shake the pan halfway through to ensure everything gets evenly charred.\n\n3\n\n**Cook the black beans.** Just before the veggies finish roasting, add the drained black beans to the pan & pop it back in the oven. **Why? ⇢** Since canned black beans are already fully cooked, the goal is just to warm them through, which takes a couple minutes, tops.\n\n![A close up shot of seasoned and roasted cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato for roasted veggie tacos are arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet.

Nuts feature tons of healthy fats, which are great for making things creamy. When blended with a liquid like water, the rich fats in cashews transform into a beautifully thick, smooth sauce. As a bonus, cashews also have a pretty neutral taste, making them the perfect vehicle for other flavorful ingredients.\n\n![An overhead shot of Smoky Chipotle Cashew Crema ingredients inside a high-speed blender carafe. Including raw cashews, garlic, chipotle pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika, ground cumin, lemon & lime juice, water, kosher salt & ground black pepper.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-11.jpg)\n\n![An open mason jar filled with Smoky Chipotle Vegan Cashew Crema sits on top of a light blue surface.

A few tips…\n\n*   **A high-speed blender** is a must for a super smooth cashew crema. We love the [Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100317571-13767625?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zwilling.com%2Fus%2F53100-900-0.html&cjsku=53100-900), which is the perfect size for whipping up a small-batch sauce! \n*   **Blend the crema longer than you think you need to.** We’re after a totally smooth & creamy sauce, which is achieved after a good 45 seconds – 1 minute of blending. If you notice bits & pieces of cashews in your crema, let the blender go a little longer, until the sauce is totally smooth.\n*   **Adjust to your liking.** The measurements included in this recipe yield my ideal consistency – seriously creamy but easy to drizzle over the roasted vegetable tacos. If you prefer a thicker crema, blend in some extra cashews. Or if you prefer a thinner sauce, add a little more water.\n*   **Allergic to cashews? ⇢** No worries! Feel free to prep your crema using dairy-free yogurt (to keep the tacos vegan) or creamy Greek yogurt. \n\n**_No high-speed blender? No problem!_ ⇢** If you do not have a high-speed blender, soak the cashews in boiling-hot water for 10-15 minutes, which helps them break down much more easily in a less powerful blender.

The edges of the tortilla get a little crispy – a fantastic contrasting texture for the tender roasted veggies & creamy cashew crema – & the littlest bit of char creates an extra layer of smoky flavor for these cauliflower & sweet potato tacos.\n\n![Charred corn tortillas are arranged atop a metal baking sheet pan that sits atop a creamy white textured surface. The baking sheet pan is surrounded by a white plateful of roasted veggie taco filling, loose lime halves, a small glass jar filled with chipotle cashew crema, and a small white bowl filled with smashed avocado.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-1-960x1440.jpg)\n\n_Full Recipe Directions, including step-by-step photos, are included in the Recipe Card, below._\n\nPlus, it makes the tortillas pretty picture perfect, & it couldn’t be easier. Here’s what you’ll do…\n\n1\n\n**Pop a tortilla directly over the open flame of a gas burner.** Once you see a little smoke coming off the edges, carefully rotate it with tongs. While you can toast up flour tortillas using this method, I suggest opting for corn tortillas.\n\n2\n\n**Continue until both sides are evenly charred**, but be careful not to overdo it. Too much cooking will completely dry the tortillas out. All you need is a little color!\n\n3\n\n**Repeat with more tortillas**, until you have enough for your taco feast. To keep your charred tortillas pliable & warm for taco assembly, pop them into a handy [tortilla warmer](https://rstyle.me/+9pxfjAMnR6SNU2RngeQwdw) until you’re ready to serve. If you do not have a tortilla warmer, try wrapping the tortillas with a damp paper towel. When you’re ready for taco assembly, simply pop them in the microwave for 30-40 seconds. The moisture in the paper towel steams the tortillas so they stay nice & pliable.\n\n**_No gas burner? No problem!_ ⇢** Many PWWB readers have replicated this charred effect by toasting their tortillas on a griddle or a hot heavy-bottomed pan, such as a large skillet. Follow the same process laid out above, toasting until your tortillas have as much char as you like – easy!\n\n**Taco Assembly + More Easy Topping Ideas**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the best parts about making tacos is assembling them – it’s when all of the flavorful components come together to create a bit of magic. ✨ Try to assemble only as many tacos you know you’ll eat – leftovers keep very well, but ideally need to be stored separately.\n\n![An overhead shot of sweet potato and cauliflower tacos in charred corn tortillas.

Next, pile on a big hearty spoonful of smoky black bean & roasted veggie taco filling. All that’s left to do? Finish it off with a generous drizzling of chipotle cashew crema (trust us, you’ll want a big spoonful here!).\n\n#### **More Easy Taco Topping Ideas**\n\nOf course, a few extra toppings never hurt on taco night! 🥰 If you feel like finishing your roasted veggie tacos off with a little something extra, try…\n\n*   **Finely chopped cilantro** for a little extra freshness or an extra squeeze of **lime juice** for a little brightness\n*   [Pickled red onions](https://playswellwithbutter.com/quick-pickled-red-onions/) for bright acidity, plus the most gorgeous bright pink pop of color.\n*   Our favorite simple [Everyday Slaw](https://playswellwithbutter.com/simple-slaw-recipe/) provides tons of texture & flavor from cabbage, peppers, & freesh herbs.

Whether you’re a longtime vegan, new to a plant-based lifestyle, or you’re simply a meat eater looking to add a few more veggie-forward recipes into your meal plan, you’re in for such a treat!\n\nWhat makes this recipe so special is how its components come together to create layers of flavor & texture that make for a particularly satisfying meal: spiced roasted veggies, hearty black beans, irresistibly creamy dairy-free crema, & smoky charred tortillas.\n\nA few tips to keep in mind along the way…\n\n*   Roast the veggies on a large sheet pan.

Drizzle the olive oil over top, then season with the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, dried oregano, 1 teaspoon kosher salt & ground black pepper as desired. Toss to combine well, then arrange in a uniform layer on the baking sheet, giving the individual veggies plenty of breathing room to roast up nicely.![How to make cauliflower and sweet potato tacos, step 1: season the cauliflower and sweet potatoes.

Roast 30 minutes, giving the pan a good shake halfway through to promote even browning, or until the veggies are tender throughout & crispy at the edges.

The consistency of your cashew crema will depend on how much juice your lime yields, so feel free to adjust as needed to reach your desired consistency (i.e. blend in more cashews for a thicker sauce, stir in a little more water for a thinner sauce). If you do not have a high-speed blender, you may want to soak your cashews for 10-15 minutes in boiling-hot water, which helps them break down much more easily in a less powerful blender. **_More tips & tricks!_** **⇢** [Easy Vegan Cashew Crema](https://playswellwithbutter.com/cashew-crema/).\n    *   **Charred corn tortillas:** To char corn tortillas on the stovetop, pop a tortilla directly over open flame on a gas burner. Once you see a little smoke coming off the tortilla, then continue to rotate it until it’s lightly charred. Continue until both sides of the tortillas are evenly charred. It’s very important not to over-do it as this will completely dry the tortillas out – just aim for a little color! Once it’s as charred as desired, transfer to a tortilla warmer or wrap it in a damp paper towel to prevent it from drying out until you’re ready to serve.\n*   **Storage & Reheating:** Leftover roasted sweet potatoes & cauliflower will keep, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for 3-5 days. Reheat leftovers in the microwave until warmed through, or under the broiler for 3-4 minutes if you like a little extra crispy-char. Leftover chipotle cashew crema will keep, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. Enjoy leftovers with more roasted veggie tacos, or use it as an all-purpose sauce for any other meals or salads. \n*   **15-Minute Meal Prep:** One of our favorite things about this roasted cauliflower sweet potato tacos recipe is how easy it is to throw together – especially if you’ve done a little bit of meal prep ahead of time. By chopping the veggies in advance, you can jump right into cooking during the week – easy!

    "markdown": "# Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower - Kirbie's Cravings\nJanuary 19, 2016\n\nby Kirbie\n\nHoney Garlic Cauliflower is an easy and delicious weeknight meal. Crunchy baked breaded cauliflower pieces are coated with honey garlic sauce.\n\n![photo of honey being drizzled over a bowl of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PeLMcZclikA/Vp3ka9dlv6I/AAAAAAAFQeA/fO_aoGOBt90/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-9.jpg)\n\nI can’t get enough of this honey garlic sauce. It’s savory, spicy, and sweet, all at the same time. And crunchy bites of cauliflower are the perfect vehicle for soaking up the thick sauce. The sauce is so versatile, too. I’ve used it to make [Honey Garlic Shrimp](https://kirbiecravings.com/honey-garlic-shrimp/) which are delicious, too.\n\nLast week we had a pretty packed schedule. Dinners with out-of-town friends, a wedding rehearsal dinner, a weekend trip for my friend’s wedding, and more. Now we’re trying to get back to a normal and healthier eating schedule. It’s definitely hard, but this tasty honey garlic cauliflower dish made things a little easier. This sauce was so delicious that I was tempted to lick my bowl clean.\n\nI like that you can serve this dish as a side dish, appetizer, or snack. We also make it as a main dish. It’s great with cooked rice or [cauliflower rice](https://kirbiecravings.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice/). \n\n![close-up photo of a piece of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-metlEgKiXpo/Vp3rOS02qxI/AAAAAAAFQeY/DyPKj5yj3E4/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-015.jpg)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   Cauliflower florets\n*   Panko bread crumbs\n*   Cooking spray\n*   Whisked eggs\n*   Sliced scallions or green onions\n*   Honey\n*   Minced garlic\n*   Onion powder\n*   Cornstarch and water\n*   Soy sauce\n*   Sriracha sauce\n\n**Cauliflower:** I use one small head of cauliflower and break it down into bite-sized florets. The florets should be about the same size so they cook evenly.\n\n**Panko:** I always measure out a little more panko than I think I’ll need because it’s easier to coat the cauliflower if there’s extra in the bowl.\n\n**Cornstarch:** This thickens the sauce. Before you add it, you will mix it with some water to dissolve it. This cornstarch mixture prevents the cornstarch from clumping up when you add it to the sauce.\n\n**Soy sauce:** I like to use low-sodium soy sauce.\n\n**Sriracha:** You can use your favorite hot sauce that is similar.\n\n![overhead photo of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9nluamvtSyo/Vp3rP0Ec9kI/AAAAAAAFQek/JK6FiktGXBs/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-009.jpg)\n\nRecipe Tips\n-----------\n\nIf the head of cauliflower you use is larger, you should double the sauce so there’s enough to coat the florets.\n\nThe sauce is very flexible, so you can adjust the ingredients to your liking. Sometimes I add more soy sauce or I add different seasonings. If you add more liquid, just be sure to increase the amount of cornstarch so your sauce is thick enough.\n\nIf you want to serve this as a main dish, you can add a cooked vegetable, green salad, or rice on the side.\n\n![close-up photo of a bowl of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ejsD_bZLmgs/Vp3kZwOcLkI/AAAAAAAFQeA/lrTYTT1a-XA/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-5.jpg)\n\nMore Cauliflower Recipes\n------------------------\n\n*   [Baked Orange Cauliflower](https://kirbiecravings.com/2015/06/baked-orange-cauliflower.html)\n*   [Lemon Cauliflower](https://kirbiecravings.com/2016/10/lemon-cauliflower.html)\n*   [Bang Bang Cauliflower](https://kirbiecravings.com/2015/01/bang-bang-cauliflower.html)\n*   [Cauliflower Tots](https://kirbiecravings.com/cauliflower-tots/)\n*   [Buffalo Cauliflower Bites](https://kirbiecravings.com/buffalo-cauliflower-bites/)\n\nRecipe now updated with video!

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread panko crumbs in a thin even layer across the surface of the baking sheet. Spray panko crumbs with cooking oil spray. Bake crumbs about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. \n    \n*   Set whisked eggs aside in a small bowl. Line another large baking sheet with parchment paper.\n    \n*   Dip cauliflower in egg mixture and then shake a few times so that excess egg drips off. You don't want to dampen your breadcrumbs with excess egg because then they won't stick to the cauliflower. Then place into sheet with panko crumbs. Cover cauliflower with panko, pressing the crumbs gently against the cauliflower to help them stick. Place coated cauliflower on empty prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all cauliflower is coated. \n    \n*   Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until cauliflower is cooked and the coating is a dark golden brown. \n    \n*   While the cauliflower is cooking, make sauce on the stove. In a small bowl, completely dissolve cornstarch in water and set aside. \n    \n*   Add all sauce ingredients except the cornstarch + water to a small pot or saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer and stir a few times until ingredients are mixed. This should only take a few seconds. Then add cornstarch water to the sauce. Stir immediately to dissolve cornstarch into the sauce. Stir occasionally and let sauce come to a simmer (make sure to stir otherwise the cornstarch will clump up) and cook until sauce starts to thicken (about 2 minutes). \n    \n*   Allow sauce to cool a few minutes and thicken even more. Drizzle over cauliflower. If you wish to completely coat cauliflower in sauce, it's best to double the sauce and brush it on with a pastry brush. Garnish with scallions.\n    \n\n*   You most likely won't need all of the panko breadcrumbs, but to ensure the cauliflower is completely coated it's easier to start with more than you need. The nutrition estimate was calculated with 1 cup of panko and does not include the excess.\n*   The recipe above makes just enough sauce to drizzle over a small head's worth of cauliflower florets. If you are using a medium or large head of cauliflower or you wish to coat the cauliflower completely in sauce, you should double the sauce.\n*   If you make any adjustments to the sauce (i.e. add more soy sauce or other liquids) you may need to also add more cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Remember to dissolve any additional cornstarch in a little water before adding it.\n\nServing: 0.25of recipe, Calories: 227kcal, Carbohydrates: 43g, Protein: 7g, Fat: 3g, Saturated Fat: 1g, Sodium: 416mg, Fiber: 2g, Sugar: 28g, NET CARBS: 41\n\nThe nutrition information provided are only estimates based on an online nutritional calculator.

Or you could use pears or figs.\n*   **Dried cranberries or raisins** add sweetness.\n*   **Nuts and seeds**: pecans, walnuts, or roasted pumpkin seeds add crunch, flavor, and healthy fats.\n*   **Crumbled feta cheese, goat, or blue cheese**\n*   **Apple cider vinaigrette**: a simple yet flavorful dressing made of honey, Dijon mustard, garlic, apple cider vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil\n*   **Protein**: toss in some shredded chicken or chickpeas (optional)\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n*   One butternut squash _peeled, seeded and diced_\n*   ½ tablespoon oil of choice\n*   salt and freshly ground pepper\n*   1/2 cup quinoa or Rice \n*   2 cups chopped kale leaves\n*   Two small apples, pears, or figs sliced or dice\n\n**Toppings:**\n\n*   ¼ cup dried cranberries\n*   ¼ cup pecans roughly chopped\n*   ⅓ cup reduced-fat crumbled feta cheese\n*   2 tbsp nuts or seeds\n\n**For the apple cider vinaigrette:**\n\n*   3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n*   2 tbsp apple cider vinegarette\n*   1 tbsp maple syrup or honey\n*   1.5 tsp Dijon mustard\n*   One garlic clove minced\n\n**Directions**\n\n**Roast the butternut squash.** Toss with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n\n**Cook the quinoa** and let it cool.\n\n**Make dressing.** Put all the ingredients in a jar and shake until combined.\n\n**Massage the kale**. Kale can be tough and bitter. Massage it with half of the dressing to bring out the sweetness and make it more tender.

Check out the Recipe Notes, below, for more guidance.\n\n**Step-by-Step Video**\n----------------------\n\n**Roast Veggie Tacos Filling**\n------------------------------\n\nThese tacos are filled with roasted sweet potatoes, cauliflower florets, and black beans. So much flavor and texture with really minimal effort – aside from tossing everything together in a homemade taco spice blend, the oven does all the work! 🙌🏼\n\n1\n\n**Season the cauliflower and sweet potatoes.** Toss the chopped veggies with the spices and some olive oil in a large mixing bowl, then spread them out on a large sheet pan. Don’t cram the veggies in! **Why? ⇢** Giving the veggies room to breathe allows steam to escape as they bake. This helps ensure the cauliflower and sweet potatoes get nice and crispy rather than soggy.\n\n2\n\n**Roast in the oven.** Roast the cauliflower and sweet potatoes for about 25 minutes, or until they’re tender through the center and beginning to get crispy around the edges. **Roasted veggies tip! ⇢** Be sure to shake the pan halfway through to ensure everything gets evenly charred.\n\n3\n\n**Cook the black beans.** Just before the veggies finish roasting, add the drained black beans to the pan and pop it back in the oven. **Why? ⇢** Since canned black beans are already fully cooked, the goal is just to warm them through, which takes a couple minutes, tops.\n\n![A close up shot of seasoned and roasted cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato for roasted veggie tacos are arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet. Drained black beans are added to the sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-7.jpg)\n\n**Smoky Chipotle Cashew Crema**\n-------------------------------\n\nThe best part of this veggie tacos recipe is easily drenching the tacos in smoky chipotle lime crema, which is completely vegan and dairy-free thanks to cashews!\n\nIf you’re new to the world of plant-based cooking, cashews are an awesome solution to creating irresistibly creamy vegan sauces like [cashew crema](https://playswellwithbutter.com/cashew-crema/). Nuts feature tons of healthy fats, which are great for making things creamy. When blended with a liquid like water, the rich fats in cashews transform into a beautifully thick, smooth sauce. As a bonus, cashews also have a pretty neutral taste, making them the perfect vehicle for other flavorful ingredients.\n\n**Smoky Chipotle Cashew Crema. ⇢** Simply combine unsalted cashews, chipotle pepper, garlic, chili powder, smoked paprika, lime juice, and water in a high-speed blender, blending until the mixture is totally smooth and creamy – easy! A few tips…\n\n*   **A high-speed blender** is a must for a super smooth cashew crema. We love the [Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100317571-13767625?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zwilling.com%2Fus%2F53100-900-0.html&cjsku=53100-900), which is the perfect size for whipping up a small-batch sauce! \n*   **Blend the crema longer than you think you need to.** We’re after a totally smooth and creamy sauce, which is achieved after a good 45 seconds – 1 minute of blending. If you notice bits and pieces of cashews in your crema, let the blender go a little longer, until the sauce is totally smooth.\n*   **Adjust to your liking.** The measurements included in this recipe yield my ideal consistency – seriously creamy but easy to drizzle over the roasted vegetable tacos. If you prefer a thicker crema, blend in some extra cashews. Or if you prefer a thinner sauce, add a little more water.\n*   **Allergic to cashews? ⇢** No worries! Feel free to prep your crema using dairy-free yogurt (to keep the tacos vegan) or creamy Greek yogurt. \n\n**_No high-speed blender? No problem!_ ⇢** If you do not have a high-speed blender, soak the cashews in boiling-hot water for 10-15 minutes, which helps them break down much more easily in a less powerful blender.

A spoon has been dipped into the vegan crema and is being pulled out covered in the orange-colored creamy sauce & falling off the spoon back into the mason jar.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-15.jpg)\n\n**How to Char Corn Tortillas**\n------------------------------\n\nOne of our favorite taco night tricks is taking plain ol’ store-bought tortillas to the next level with a light char over the flame of a gas burner. The edges of the tortilla get a little crispy – a fantastic contrasting texture for the tender roasted veggies and creamy cashew crema – and the littlest bit of char creates an extra layer of smoky flavor for these cauliflower and sweet potato tacos.\n\n![Charred corn tortillas are arranged atop a metal baking sheet pan that sits atop a creamy white textured surface.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-1-960x1440.jpg)\n\nPlus, it makes the tortillas pretty picture-perfect, and it couldn’t be easier. Here’s what you’ll do…\n\n1\n\n**Pop a tortilla directly over the open flame of a gas burner.** Once you see a little smoke coming off the edges, carefully rotate it with tongs. While you can toast up flour tortillas using this method, I suggest opting for corn tortillas.\n\n2\n\n**Continue until both sides are evenly charred**, but be careful not to overdo it. Too much cooking will completely dry the tortillas out. All you need is a little color!\n\n3\n\n**Repeat with more tortillas**, until you have enough for your taco feast. To keep your charred tortillas pliable and warm for taco assembly, pop them into a handy [tortilla warmer](https://rstyle.me/+9pxfjAMnR6SNU2RngeQwdw) until you’re ready to serve. If you do not have a tortilla warmer, try wrapping the tortillas with a damp paper towel. When you’re ready for taco assembly, simply pop them in the microwave for 30-40 seconds. The moisture in the paper towel steams the tortillas so they stay nice and pliable.\n\n**_No gas burner? No problem!_ ⇢** Many PWWB readers have replicated this charred effect by toasting their tortillas on a griddle or a hot heavy-bottomed pan, such as a large skillet. Follow the same process laid out above, toasting until your tortillas have as much char as you like – easy!\n\n**Taco Assembly + More Easy Topping Ideas**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the best parts about making tacos is assembling them – it’s when all of the flavorful components come together to create a bit of magic. ✨ Try to assemble only as many tacos you know you’ll eat – leftovers keep very well, but ideally need to be stored separately.\n\n![An overhead shot of sweet potato and cauliflower tacos in charred corn tortillas and drizzled with chipotle cashew crema and garnished with fresh chopped cilantro atop a parchment lined baking sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-7.jpg)\n\n**Assembling the ideal roasted veggie taco. ⇢** Grab a charred corn tortilla (don’t forget to reheat them so the tacos aren’t too dry – see above!), then smear it with mashed avocado (I.e. a little avocado with some lime juice). Next, pile on a big hearty spoonful of smoky black bean and roasted veggie taco filling. All that’s left to do? Finish it off with a generous drizzling of chipotle cashew crema (trust us, you’ll want a big spoonful here!).\n\n#### **More Easy Taco Topping Ideas**\n\nOf course, a few extra toppings never hurt on taco night! 🥰 If you feel like finishing your roasted veggie tacos off with a little something extra, try…\n\n*   **Finely chopped cilantro** for a little extra freshness or an extra squeeze of **lime juice** for a little brightness\n*   [Pickled red onions](https://playswellwithbutter.com/quick-pickled-red-onions/) for bright acidity, plus the most gorgeous bright pink pop of color.\n*   Our favorite simple [Everyday Slaw](https://playswellwithbutter.com/simple-slaw-recipe/) provides tons of texture and flavor from cabbage, peppers, and fresh herbs. Plus, it’s made with minimal mayo (or fabanaise, if made vegan) – easy!\n\n![A side angle shot of roasted veggie tacos drizzled with chipotle cashew crema and fresh chopped cilantro arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-12.jpg)\n\nWe can’t wait for you to try these **Sweet Potato and Cauliflower Tacos**!

Gather and prep all ingredients according to Ingredients List, above (e.g. break down the cauliflower, dice the sweet potato, measure the spices, etc.).![Cauliflower florets, sweet potato, olive oil, chili powder, ground cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, dried oregano, black beans, roasted unsalted cashews, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, garlic, and lime arranged on a light peach colored surface and a wooden cutting board.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-2-595x397.jpg)\n2.  **Season the cauliflower and sweet potatoes:** Place the cauliflower florets and sweet potato in a large bowl or on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the olive oil over top, then season with the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, dried oregano, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and ground black pepper as desired. Toss to combine well, then arrange in a uniform layer on the baking sheet, giving the individual veggies plenty of breathing room to roast up nicely.![Cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with spices are arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet.

Roast 30 minutes, giving the pan a good shake halfway through to promote even browning, or until the veggies are tender throughout and crispy at the edges. In the last 5 minutes of roasting, place the drained black beans on the sheet pan, allowing them to warm up as the veggies finish cooking. Remove from the oven. Squeeze the lime juice over the surface of the sheet pan and set aside.![Seasoned and roasted cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato are arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet.

Combine all listed ingredients in a high-speed blender. Blend until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender canister as needed. Transfer to a bowl and set aside, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. (At my house, we like to enjoy these tacos with a simple smashed avocado (avocado + lime + salt) and charred tortillas (more notes on this in the Recipe Notes, below) – this is a great time to prepare both of these components as well.)\n    \n    [![Raw cashews, garlic, chipotle pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika, ground cumin, lemon & lime juice, water, kosher salt & ground black pepper inside a high-speed blender carafe.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-10.jpg)](https://playswellwithbutter.com/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-with-chipotle-cashew-crema-10/)\n    \n    [![An overhead shot of blended chipotle cashew crema inside of an open high-speed blender carafe.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-12.jpg)](https://playswellwithbutter.com/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-with-chipotle-cashew-crema-12/)\n    \n5.  **Assemble and serve:** Pile the roasted veggies and black beans into a tortilla, with smashed avocado and a good drizzle of cashew crema as desired. Finish with any other toppings of choice – cashew crema, chopped cilantro, lime juice, salsa – whatever your taco-lovin’ heart desires. Enjoy!![A close up shot of sweet potato tacos with cauliflower drizzled with chipotle cashew crema and fresh chopped cilantro arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-16-595x397.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Ingredient Notes:**\n    *   **Cashews:** If you cannot find roasted, unsalted cashews, feel free to use raw cashews for your cashew crema. The consistency of your cashew crema will depend on how much juice your lime yields, so feel free to adjust as needed to reach your desired consistency (i.e. blend in more cashews for a thicker sauce, stir in a little more water for a thinner sauce). If you do not have a high-speed blender, you may want to soak your cashews for 10-15 minutes in boiling-hot water, which helps them break down much more easily in a less powerful blender. **_More tips and tricks!_** **⇢** [Easy Vegan Cashew Crema](https://playswellwithbutter.com/cashew-crema/).\n    *   **Charred corn tortillas:** To char corn tortillas on the stovetop, pop a tortilla directly over open flame on a gas burner. Once you see a little smoke coming off the tortilla, then continue to rotate it until it’s lightly charred. Continue until both sides of the tortillas are evenly charred. It’s very important not to over-do it as this will completely dry the tortillas out – just aim for a little color! Once it’s as charred as desired, transfer to a tortilla warmer or wrap it in a damp paper towel to prevent it from drying out until you’re ready to serve.\n*   **Storage and Reheating:** Leftover roasted sweet potatoes and cauliflower will keep, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for 3-5 days. Reheat leftovers in the microwave until warmed through, or under the broiler for 3-4 minutes if you like a little extra crispy-char. Leftover chipotle cashew crema will keep, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. Enjoy leftovers with more roasted veggie tacos, or use it as an all-purpose sauce for any other meals or salads. \n*   **15-Minute Meal Prep:** One of our favorite things about this roasted cauliflower sweet potato tacos recipe is how easy it is to throw together – especially if you’ve done a little bit of meal prep ahead of time. By chopping the veggies in advance, you can jump right into cooking during the week – easy! Here’s what you’ll do…\n    *   **_Roasted veggie prep:_** Chop the cauliflower and dice sweet potato according to the Ingredients List, above.

With diced sweet potatoes, fluffy quinoa, fresh spinach, creamy avocado, and a delightful combination of dried cranberries and slivered almonds, this **Roasted Sweet Potato, Spinach and Quinoa Salad** offers a burst of flavors and textures.\n\n![bowl of roasted sweet potato, spinach & quinoa salad](https://happilyunprocessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/roasted-sweet-potato-spinach-quinoa-salad.jpg)\n\nWHY THIS SALAD WORKS:\n---------------------\n\nDrizzled with a zesty lemon vinaigrette, every bite is a harmonious blend of tanginess and earthiness. The roasted sweet potatoes, cooked quinoa, and vibrant greens create a satisfying base, while the addition of red onion and garlic-infused dressing takes it to the next level. It all gets tossed together and is served immediately for a vibrant and nourishing meal.\n\nHow to Make It:\n---------------\n\n1.  To start, we roast the sweet potatoes until they’re tender and perfectly caramelized.\n2.  Meanwhile, the quinoa cooks in a flavorful chicken or vegetable stock, absorbing all the deliciousness. Once ready, we combine the roasted sweet potatoes, fluffy quinoa, chopped spinach, dried cranberries, sliced red onion, creamy avocado, and crunchy slivered almonds in a large bowl.\n3.  Now, let’s talk about the star of the show – the Lemon Vinaigrette. This zesty dressing brings everything together, adding a tangy and refreshing element to the salad. It combines red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, dried oregano, fresh basil, roasted garlic, organic lemon juice, olive oil, sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Whisking it all together creates a flavorful and emulsified dressing that perfectly complements the salad’s ingredients.\n4.  Remember, this salad is best served immediately to retain its freshness and crunch. The lemon vinaigrette adds a delightful tang, but be mindful not to overdress the salad, as it can cause the greens to wilt.\n\nNourishing Bliss\n----------------\n\nOur Wholesome Sweet Potato Quinoa Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette is not only a feast for the taste buds but also a nutritional powerhouse. Sweet potatoes offer a dose of vitamins and fiber, quinoa provides protein and essential nutrients, and spinach adds a boost of iron and antioxidants. It’s a salad that nourishes both the body and the soul.\n\n[![bowl of roasted sweet potato, spinach & quinoa salad](https://happilyunprocessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Quinoa-Salad-2pic.jpg)](https://happilyunprocessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Quinoa-Salad-2pic.jpg)\n\nNot only does this delicious satisfy your taste buds with its vibrant and refreshing flavors, but it also nourishes your body and uplifts your soul.

Peel and dice the sweet potato in even cubes.  Toss them in a bowl along with the garlic and drizzle them with the olive oil.  Season liberally with salt and pepper.  Place them on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper or a Silpat.  If you crowd all the potatoes together they steam vs roast.  Roast for 15 minutes, give them a stir and check for doneness.  Roast another 5-10 minutes or until done but not mushy.\n3.  Meanwhile add the chicken (or veg) stock to a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the rinsed quinoa, cover and lower the heat to a simmer.   Cook for approx. 15 minutes or until all the water has been absorbed.  When done, fluff with a fork and set a clean dish cloth over it to steam.   Peel the garlic and mash.\n4.  Next prepare the salad dressing by combining all the ingredients (including the peeled garlic) minus the olive oil.  Whisk vigorously and SLOWLY DRIZZLE in the olive oil until the dressing is emulsified.\n5.  Add the sweet potatoes, quinoa, chopped spinach, dried cranberries, red onion, avocado and slivered almonds in a large bowl.  Toss the salad with the desired amount of dressing (there will be extra).  Serve immediately.\n6.  This salad will wilt if the dressing is left on too long.  It is best served immediately.\n\n**WHAT TO SERVE WITH THIS:**  \n[BETTER THAN BEEF TURKEY BURGERS](https://happilyunprocessed.com/better-than-beef-turkey-burgers/)\n\n**LOOKING FOR MORE GREAT RECIPES?**  \nSubscribe to our newsletter to get family friendly healthy recipes delivered to your inbox.

But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like.

    "markdown": "# Fajita Veggies (Chipotle Inspired) - It's a Veg World After All®\n_Learn how to make delicious homemade fajita veggies, inspired by the sautéed peppers and onions at Chipotle restaurant. These colorful vegetables are a key ingredient in fajitas but can be used in a variety of other ways!_\n\n![cooked fajita veggies in a cast iron skillet next to a spoon and napkin](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-4.jpg)\n\n_This post may contain affiliate links. For more information, see my [affiliate disclosure](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/privacy-policy/)._\n\nIn my college years, I absolutely LOVED Chipotle. When a new one popped up a mile down the road from my childhood house, my younger brother and I were frequent visitors when we were home for the summer. We sometimes went twice a week!\n\nI usually ordered a burrito bowl or tacos, but regardless of my order, I always made sure it had fajita veggies! If you’re not familiar with these veggies, they’re perfectly tender, slightly charred, and have the best Mexican seasoning.\n\nSeeing how much I love Chipotle’s vegetables, it’s only right that I devote a post to homemade fajita veggies. They’re very fitting for the Veg World, after all. Plus, since I no longer live close to a Chipotle, I need to get my fix somehow!\n\nIn this recipe, I use red, orange, and green bell [peppers](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/category/peppers/), red [onion](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/category/onions/), and a simple fajita seasoning made from oregano, salt, and cumin. Then I cook the veggies in a cast iron skillet to get the same texture and charring that you see at Chipotle and other Mexican restaurants. They turned out great IMO!\n\n![three bell peppers, a red onion, and a dish with seasonings on a counter](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-1.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Fajita Veggies\n--------------------------\n\n*   **How to cut bell peppers and onions for fajitas.** First, remove the stems and seeds from the peppers. Slice them in half, then cut them into thin strips. For the onion, remove the skin and ends. Slice it in half, then cut the halves into thin, half-moon pieces.\n*   **Cook the fajita veggies in hot oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.** For firmer veggies, cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. I prefer to cook the veggies for 10 to 15 minutes so that they’re softer and more charred. Add the seasonings in the beginning and sprinkle with salt throughout the cooking process.\n\nOnce the veggies are cooked to your liking, serve them with tortillas, other fajita fillings (like chicken, beef, or beans), and an assortment of your favorite toppings (like sour cream, guac, or cheese).\n\n*   ![thinly sliced red and orange bell peppers on a cutting board with a chef's knife](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-2.jpg)\n    \n*   ![sliced peppers and onions dusted with seasonings in a large cast iron skillet](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-3.jpg)\n    \n\nExpert Tips\n-----------\n\n*   **Any kind of bell peppers will work for this recipe**, but I prefer to use a variety of colors! For an extra kick, consider adding some sliced [jalapenos](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/category/jalapenos/).\n*   **For best results, use a large [cast iron skillet](https://amzn.to/3fbrddI)**. The skillet will be exceptionally full when you add the veggies, but they will cook down. Stir the veggies occasionally with a wooden spoon, and scrape up any charred bits that stick to the pan.\n*   **What to do with leftover fajita veggies.** Add them to salads, eggs, and bowls (like my [Healthy Chicken Fajita Bowl](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/healthy-chicken-fajita-bowl/)!!!). They will last for 3 to 5 days in an airtight container in the fridge.\n\n![close shot of fajita peppers and onions in a cast iron skillet](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fajita-Veggies-5.jpg)\n\nMore Mexican-Inspired Vegetable Dishes\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   [Spinach Basil Pesto Quesadillas](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/pesto-quesadillas/)\n*   [Veggie-Loaded Slow Cooker Mexican Shredded Chicken](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/veggie-slow-cooker-mexican-chicken/)\n*   [Ancho Chile Sweet Potato Black Bean Tacos](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/black-bean-sweet-potato-tacos/)\n*   [Double Pepper Mango Salsa](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/double-pepper-mango-salsa/)\n*   [Loaded Radish Chip Nachos](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/loaded-radish-chip-nachos/)\n*   [Spaghetti Squash Burrito Bowls](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/spaghetti-squash-burrito-bowls/)\n*   [Radish and Black Bean Tacos with Avocado Crema](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/radish-and-black-bean-tacos/)\n*   [Healthy Creamy Jalapeno Sauce](https://itsavegworldafterall.com/healthy-creamy-jalapeno-sauce/)\n\n**I’d love to hear how you like this recipe!

Season with more salt as desired.\n    \n*   Remove from heat and serve in fajitas, tacos, or burritos.\n    \n\n*   To make this recipe spicier, add sliced jalapenos.\n*   Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 5 days. You can eat them cold, or you can reheat them in the microwave on high for 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nServing: 1serving | Calories: 89kcal | Carbohydrates: 5g | Protein: 1g | Fat: 7g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 100mg | Potassium: 152mg | Fiber: 2g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 1863IU | Vitamin C: 77mg | Calcium: 8mg | Iron: 1mg\n\n_Enjoy! – Lizzie_\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

    "markdown": "# Fall Quinoa Spinach Salad - Eating Bird Food\nThis post may include [affiliate links](#). Thank you for your support.\n\n> This quinoa spinach salad is loaded with fall favorites like butternut squash, chopped apples and quinoa. It is packed with nutrition and flavor and you’ll love the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing!\n\nI typically go crazy with pumpkin recipes as soon as fall hits, but today I have a pumpkin-less recipe that features more fall produce favorites – butternut squash, apples and greens. I’ve been eating these things separately or in other dishes, but finally decided to throw them all together for a tasty meal-sized salad.\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples. A fork of on the plate and a dish towel to the side.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fall-harvest-salad-updated.jpg)\n\nHearty fall salads are seriously the best! In this Quinoa Spinach Salad, the [roasted butternut squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/web-stories/how-to-make-roasted-butternut-squash/) makes it sweet and satisfying, while the apple and pepitas add a nice crunch. Quinoa adds some staying power and the spinach nourishes the body in a way that no other food (besides other leafy greens) can. If you like my [garlicky kale salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/garlicky-kale/), you’ll love this one because the dressing is almost exactly the same – I just added a little maple syrup to sweeten it up a bit. And if you enjoy this salad, you should also check out my full roundup of [quinoa salad recipes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/easy-quinoa-salad/).\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad.jpg)\n\nHealth Benefits of Quinoa\n-------------------------\n\nI love using quinoa as a base for salads. It’s naturally gluten-free, high in protein and one of few plant foods that contain all nine essential amino acids ([source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-quinoa)). Not only that, but it’s also high in fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin E and various beneficial antioxidants! Talk about a powerhouse ingredient!\n\nUnfamiliar with making quinoa? I’ve got a great guide on [how to cook quinoa](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/) and it’s loaded with information about this little seed too.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being fully mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-2.jpg)\n\nHere’s What You Need\n--------------------\n\n*   **baby spinach** and **quinoa** – the base of this [meal-sized salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-build-a-healthy-salad/). You’ll need 1 1/2 cups of cooked quinoa which is 1/2 cup dry quinoa.\n*   **butternut squash** – cut the squash into uniform, bite-size pieces so they roast evenly.\n*   **apple** –  I prefer to use Honeycrisp, Pink Lady or Fuji apples, but any variety will work. Uniform, bite sized pieces are ideal here too so you can get a bite with all the flavors together!\n*   **pepitas** – pepitas are pumpkin seeds without the shell, but if you can’t find them you can use regular pumpkin seeds or even pecans for a nice added crunch. Roast them alongside the butternut squash for a roasted flavor boost.\n*   **dried cranberries** – I love adding dried fruit to my salads for a little touch of sweetness and texture. Raisins would also be great in this recipe.\n*   **tahini apple cider vinegar dressing** – tahini, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, tamari, nutritional yeast, garlic and a touch of maple syrup make up this delicious salad dressing.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest salad in a glass bowl being tossed with the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-3.jpg)\n\nSteps to Build This Salad\n-------------------------\n\n**Prep butternut squash** – Prepare the squash by peeling it, cutting it in half and scraping out the seeds, then cut the squash into bite-size cubes. You can also buy pre-cut butternut squash to skip this step! Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and roast at 400°F for 30-40 minutes, turning once or twice, until all the pieces are tender and have a few small brown spots.\n\n**Roast pepitas** – If your pepitas or pecans are raw, you can toast them in the oven with the roasting squash. Spread seeds/nuts on a separate baking sheet and add to the oven with the butternut squash for 5 to 10 minutes or until the seeds/nuts are golden and crunchy, then remove from the pan to cool. Be sure to watch the seeds/nuts carefully because they can burn quickly. The pepitas will take less time to toast than the pecans because they’re smaller.\n\n**Assemble salad** – While roasting the squash, toss together spinach, cooked quinoa, apple and cranberries in a large salad bowl. Add cooled pepitas (or pecans) once they’ve been toasted. Once the butternut squash is done roasting, allow it to cool and then place into the salad bowl with the other ingredients.\n\n**Make dressing** – While while butternut squash is roasting, prepare the dressing by placing all remaining ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n**Serve** – Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.\n\n![Tossed fall harvest spinach salad in a glass bowl with wooden spoons.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nSwitch it up!\n-------------\n\nYou can easily swap some of the ingredients in this salad and get an entirely different meal that will be equally delicious!\n\n*   **Baby spinach** – use another dark, leafy green like kale or collard greens. Arugula is a great salad base as well.\n*   **Butternut squash** – try [roasted sweet potatoes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/coconut-oil-roasted-sweet-potatoes/) instead, or even [cinnamon maple roasted Kabocha Squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-roasted-kabocha-squash/).\n*   **Apple** – instead of apple, you could use pears or even [jicama](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/jicama-nutrition-benefits).\n*   **Pepitas** – as mentioned above, you can also use pumpkin seeds or pecans. The idea here is to add some crunch so any kind of nut or seed will do!\n*   **Dried cranberries** – raisins or dried cherries would also be tasty!\n\nHow to Serve Fall Quinoa Spinach Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nFor me, this is a meal-sized salad I would eat on its own. But it would also make a great side salad if you want to serve it to more people! Here are some great ideas to serve alongside this salad:\n\n*   [Apple Cider Vinegar Chicken](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/apple-cider-vinegar-chicken/)\n*   [Pumpkin Spice Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/pumpkin-spice-salmon/)\n*   [Eggplant Casserole with Ground Turkey](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/eggplant-casserole/)\n*   [Maple Glazed Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-soy-broiled-salmon/)\n*   [Butternut Squash Soup](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/butternut-squash-soup/)\n*   [Healthy Turkey Chili](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/turkey-chili/)\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples.

This healthy salad is make ahead friendly for quick lunches. Goat cheese, avocado, and a honey lemon dressing bring lots of flavor to this gluten free power salad! kristineskitchenblog.com\")\n\nI am vowing once again to make lunchtime more interesting. When it comes to [healthy dinners](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/category/main-dish/30-minute-dinners/), I have tons of favorite easy recipes to rely on. I’m also always sure to make a healthy breakfast, usually either [overnight oats](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/strawberry-chia-overnight-oats/), eggs and toast, or these [Healthy Greek Yogurt Pancakes](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/lemon-greek-yogurt-pancakes/).\n\nBut when it comes to lunch, I never quite have a plan and we usually end up eating a sandwich or quesadilla. I thought about my [Healthy Broccoli Salad](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/no-mayo-broccoli-salad-blueberries-apple/) or [Tabouli](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/tabouli-salad/). Some days (like today) I plan ahead and chop some veggies to eat with our favorite [white bean dip](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/easy-white-bean-dip/), but more often than I care to admit I eat a boring peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.\n\n![Kale Salad ingredients in white bowl including avocado, quinoa, blueberries, almonds and goat cheese. ](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kale-superfood-salad-1200-7521.jpg?resize=600%2C900&ssl=1 \"This Kale Salad with Quinoa, Blueberries and Avocado is loaded with super foods! This healthy salad is make ahead friendly for quick lunches. Goat cheese, avocado, and a honey lemon dressing bring lots of flavor to this gluten free power salad! kristineskitchenblog.com\")\n\nThe key, I’ve discovered, is to prep make ahead lunches that we can then enjoy throughout the week. The middle of the day is a super busy time when I’m at home with the kids, so lunch has to come together FAST. On work and school days, the best options are those that are ready to grab and go, like leftovers or make ahead salads.\n\nYou can make the quinoa ahead of time by following my [How to Cook Quinoa guide.](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/)\n\nLast week was my first week of summer break from teaching, so I promised myself I was going to get creative in the kitchen and make us a salad that Brad and I could enjoy for a few days’ worth of lunches. I knew I wanted it to have quinoa and blueberries in it. Then I decided it had to have avocado. And almonds.\n\nWe had lots of kale washed and ready to go in our refrigerator since I had just recorded the video for [how to wash kale](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/how-to-wash-and-store-kale-for-smoothies-and-salads/).

The quinoa provides a good amount of protein as well. I’m listing the chickpeas as optional in the ingredient list, as this salad is delicious both with and without them.\n\nYou can make this Kale Quinoa Salad with Blueberries ahead of time for grab and go work lunches. I recommend waiting to add the avocado and almonds right before serving, to keep the avocado fresh and the almonds crunchy.\n\n![tossed kale quinoa salad with avocado, blueberries, goat cheese and almonds](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kale-superfood-salad-1200-7578.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&ssl=1 \"This Kale Salad with Quinoa, Blueberries and Avocado is loaded with super foods!

Kale is low in calories, high in fiber, and has nearly 3 grams of protein per cup. Blueberries have one of the highest levels of antioxidants among all foods.

Place quinoa and 2 cups water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook for about 15 minutes until water is absorbed. Transfer to a large bowl to cool.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, make the dressing. Whisk together all dressing ingredients in a large salad bowl. Add the kale and, using your hands, toss it with the dressing.\n    \n*   Once the quinoa is cool, add it to the bowl with the kale, along with the chickpeas (if using), blueberries, goat cheese, almonds, and avocado. Toss gently to combine. Serve.\n    \n\nMake Ahead Instructions: Salad will last for 3 days in the refrigerator, making it a great option for make-ahead lunches.

    "markdown": "# California Roasted Sweet Potato Kale Salad | Ambitious Kitchen\nWHOA. Before we get into all the adjectives and descriptives about this salad, let me just say… YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS! Completely and utterly obsessed is simply an understatement.\n\nI shared this salad a couple of years back and just had to bring it out again. This salad was inspired by one of my [go-to take out spots](https://docbsrestaurant.com/locations/chicago-river-north/) in Chicago and their fabulous kale salad. I simply can’t get enough. It’s made with the most ridiculously good garlic tahini dressing, plus there are roasted sweet potatoes, crunchy wasabi peas (or you can sub roasted chickpeas!), sweet cranberries, creamy avocado and my special touch: sweet and spicy toasted pistachios.\n\nNow, doesn’t this **sweet potato kale salad** just sound fabulous? Well, trust your girl and make this salad. I crave it all the time. It’s perfect with a hearty protein like chicken or salmon, or lovely on its own. Bonus: it’s delicious even after a few days in the fridge!

This vegan sweet potato kale salad is bursting with flavor and easy to customize with additional protein! The perfect veggie-packed lunch or dinner during the week.\")\n\nWhat you’ll need to make this sweet potato kale salad\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nGet ready to fall in love with the textures and flavors in this vegan kale sweet potato salad. From the creamy dressing to the tender sweet potatoes and crunch from pistachios, every bite gets better than the next. Here’s what you’ll need to make it:\n\n*   **For the dressing:** we’re making a simple maple tahini dressing with [tahini](https://amzn.to/3Jh7s5F), [garlic powder](https://amzn.to/42fqiTp), lemon juice, [maple syrup](https://www.amazon.com/Butternut-Mountain-Farm-Vermont-Natural/dp/B00248E7ZK?crid=V8VGUXNGF423&keywords=pure+maple+syrup&qid=1678816808&sprefix=pure+maple+syrup%2Caps%2C142&sr=8-2&linkCode=sl1&tag=ambitkitch06-20&linkId=cb998ba83af243063defa21445d0b4e9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), [dijon mustard](https://amzn.to/3sXWr07), salt & pepper.\n*   **For the salad base:** you’ll need a large sweet potato & [olive oil](https://amzn.to/3FpYUYR) for roasting, plus a bunch of kale. We prefer to use Tuscan kale in this recipe!\n*   **For the pistachios:** I love adding some flavor to these [pistachios](https://amzn.to/2M18kBy) by toasting them with maple syrup, [cayenne pepper](https://amzn.to/3l7do9n) and a bit of sea salt.\n*   **Extra toppings:** finish it off with [dried cranberries](https://amzn.to/2YgoklT), avocado and yummy [wasabi peas](https://amzn.to/3a3Qd63) for extra crunch. Be sure to check the label of your wasabi peas to ensure that they’re certified gluten free if you need the salad to be gluten free.\n\n![roasted sweet potatoes on a baking sheet](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/California-Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Kale-Salad-1.jpg \"Gorgeous California roasted sweet potato kale salad with dried cranberries, avocado, sweet & spicy pistachios and a creamy tahini dressing. This vegan sweet potato kale salad is bursting with flavor and easy to customize with additional protein! The perfect veggie-packed lunch or dinner during the week.\")\n\nCustomize your salad\n--------------------\n\nThis roasted sweet potato kale salad is naturally vegan, gluten free & grain free and paleo friendly, but it’s easy to customize with other veggies or pantry staples you might have on hand, too. Here’s what I can suggest:\n\n*   **Mix up the produce:** feel free to use butternut squash in place of the sweet potato.\n*   **Try a new dressing:** if you don’t have tahini, try my [feta yogurt dressing](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/feta-yogurt-dressing/ \"Creamy Feta Yogurt Dressing (or dip!)\") or even my [greek yogurt ranch](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-greek-yogurt-ranch-dressing/ \"Healthy Greek Yogurt Ranch Dressing\"). But trust me the tahini dressing is a GAME changer.\n*   **Add a new sweetness:** chopped dates, raisins, dried cherries and even apple slices are the perfect swap for the cranberries.\n*   **Swap the crunch:** out of pistachios and/or wasabi peas? Make sweet & spicy cashews instead, and try roasted salted chickpeas! I recommend these swaps if you can’t find gluten free wasabi peas.\n*   **Make it paleo:** feel free to omit the wasabi peas, too, to keep the salad paleo.\n\n![pouring tahini dressing onto a bowl of kale](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/California-Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Kale-Salad-2.jpg \"Gorgeous California roasted sweet potato kale salad with dried cranberries, avocado, sweet & spicy pistachios and a creamy tahini dressing.

You can even do this with your hands and “massage” the dressing in so that all of the kale is well coated.\n*   Let it marinate! That’s right, you’ll want to let the dressed kale sit for at least 15 minutes before adding the other toppings so that it soaks up all of the flavor. It makes all the difference.\n\n![vegan sweet potato kale salad in a bowl](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/California-Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Kale-Salad-4.jpg \"Gorgeous California roasted sweet potato kale salad with dried cranberries, avocado, sweet & spicy pistachios and a creamy tahini dressing.

The kale, dressing, and sweet potato cubes can be kept in the fridge while everything else can be kept at room temp until ready to toss together and serve.\n\nThat being said, the salad can also be tossed together ahead of time too if you prefer to do this; it’s great even a few days later! I recommend just leaving out the avocado until ready to serve.\n\n![roasted sweet potato kale salad on a plate with avocado](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/California-Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Kale-Salad-7.jpg \"Gorgeous California roasted sweet potato kale salad with dried cranberries, avocado, sweet & spicy pistachios and a creamy tahini dressing.

This vegan sweet potato kale salad is bursting with flavor and easy to customize with additional protein! The perfect veggie-packed lunch or dinner during the week.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   **For the dressing:**\n*   ¼ cup tahini\n*   ½ teaspoon garlic powder\n*   2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n*   1 teaspoon pure maple syrup\n*   ½ teaspoon dijon mustard\n*   ½ teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n*   Lots of freshly ground black pepper\n*   2-3 tablespoons warm water, to thin the dressing\n*   **For the salad:**\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   1 medium to large sweet potato, cut into ½ inch cubes (or 2 cups cubed sweet potato)\n*   1 bunch of Tuscan kale, stems removed and very finely chopped (or 8-10 cups chopped kale)\n*   ½ cup dried cranberries\n*   1 avocado, sliced or diced\n*   ½ cup wasabi peas\\* (or roasted salted chickpeas), for crunch\n*   **For the sweet and spicy pistachios:**\n*   ½ cup shelled roasted pistachios\n*   1 tablespoon pure maple syrup\n*   ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper\n*   Sprinkle of sea salt\n\n### Instructions\n\n*   Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Add cubed sweet potatoes onto the pan and drizzle with olive oil; toss well to coat the sweet potatoes in oil. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until tender, flipping halfway through.\n    \n*   In a medium bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the dressing: tahini, garlic powder, fresh lemon juice, pure maple syrup, dijon mustard, salt, pepper and water. I like to start with 2 tablespoons of water, but you may need 3 total tablespoons to achieve a creamy dressing that is easily pourable. You’ll want to be able to coat all of the kale nicely so a thinner dressing is better. Set dressing aside.\n    \n*   Add the finely chopped kale to a large bowl and pour the dressing over. Use a tongs to coat the kale with the dressing; you REALLY want to get it mixed well so toss together for a few minutes to help breakdown the kale. Allow the dressing to sit with the kale for 15 minutes or longer to help the kale marinate with the dressing. Add in your roasted sweet potato cubes, cranberries, avocado and wasabi peas or roasted chickpeas. Give the salad a gentle toss to combine.\n    \n*   Finally make your sweet and spicy pistachios: place pistachio in a skillet over medium heat. Toast nutes for 4-6 minutes, stirring frequently until they turn just slightly golden then turn off heat and immediately add in maple syrup, cayenne pepper and sea salt. Stir for 15 more seconds to coat pistachios, then transfer to a piece of parchment paper to cool for a few minutes. Pistachios may stick together so try to spread them in an even layer when they are cooling. Slightly chop once they’re a little cool and place them on the salad. Enjoy! Salad keeps well for 3-4 days. Serves 4-6\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\nFeel free to make this salad heartier by adding chopped chicken breast or chopped bacon. Or both!\n\nFor a vegetarian hearty salad option, feel free to add in 1 cup cooked quinoa.\n\n**\\*To make paleo:** simply omit the wasabi peas.\n\n**\\*To ensure gluten free:** check your label to make sure your wasabi peas are gluten free, or check the full post for ways to swap them out for a different crunch.\n\n### Nutrition\n\nServing: 1serving (based on 6)Calories: 330calCarbohydrates: 40.1gProtein: 9gFat: 18.3gSaturated Fat: 2.6gFiber: 9.3gSugar: 14.6g\n\nRecipe by: Monique Volz // Ambitious Kitchen | Photography by: [Eat Love Eats](https://eatloveeats.com/)\n\n_This post was originally published on January 26th, 2021, and republished on March 15th, 2023._"

I start with a few ingredients and then I keep adding more and adding more. I just can’t stop! I figure, we need to make the most of summer and enjoy ALL of the freshest produce we possibly can. I don’t want any fruits and veggies to feel left out:) Plus, we need to be tasting the rainbow every day!\n\nThis **Summer Farro Salad** is summer perfection.

If you haven’t had farro, you really need to join the farro fan club. It is one of my favorite whole grains. It is similar to barley in texture and has a nutty flavor. It is a good source of fiber, protein, magnesium, and iron.\n\nI like to cook farro on Sunday so I can add it to my salads all week long. This way it is already cooked and ready to go. Farro is easy to meal prep, just keep it in the fridge in a container until you are ready to use it. It will last all week. You can also freeze it for up to a month.\n\nAll of Your Favorite Summer Ingredients\n---------------------------------------\n\nI love this salad because it is loaded with summer goodness. It makes a great side dish to any meal, but it is hearty enough to be the meal. I often eat this salad for lunch and it always hits the spot! The salad ingredients include:\n\n*   farro\n*   greens (use your favorite)\n*   peaches\n*   blueberries\n*   tomatoes\n*   sweet corn\n*   basil\n*   feta cheese\n*   lemon dressing\n\nYep, this salad screams summer!

Cook the farro according to package instructions. Pro tip-Trader Joe’s sells quick cooking farro that will save you some time and it’s really good.\n*   Use the freshest produce you can find. This is a summer salad so it should be easy! Shop your farmers market or get the ingredients from your garden, or your neighbor’s garden:)\n*   You don’t have to cook the sweet corn. Just cut of the corn kernels with a sharp knife and add the corn to the salad. Raw corn is so good!\n*   You can use grape or cherry tomatoes for this salad. If you have larger garden tomatoes that you need to use up, you can chop them and add them to the salad.\n*   Use your favorite greens, kale, spinach, mixed greens or arugula are all great options.\n*   I love the addition of feta cheese, but goat cheese would be good too! If you need the salad to be vegan or dairy-free you can leave out the cheese. It will still have plenty of flavor.\n*   If you need the salad to be gluten-free, you can use quinoa instead of farro.\n*   Feel free to throw in additional herbs from your garden. Fresh mint and chives would be nice.\n\nOk, are you guys ready to ROCK your summer salad? You are going to LOVE this one! If you take it to a summer potluck, I bet everyone will beg you for the recipe and you will leave with an empty bowl. It is a summer star!\n\n### More Summer Salads\n\n*   [Black Bean Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/black-bean-salad/)\n*   [Easy Pasta Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/easy-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Southwest Pasta Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/southwest-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Blueberry Corn Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/blueberry-corn-salad/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken Blueberry Feta Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/grilled-chicken-blueberry-feta-salad-with-lemon-poppy-seed-dressing/)\n*   [Tomato Peach and Corn Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/tomato-peach-corn-salad/)\n\n![Easy Summer Farro Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMMER-FARRO-SALAD-4.jpg \"Summer Farro Salad With All Of The Best Summer Ingredients: Peaches, Blueberries, Corn, Tomatoes, And Basil.

Tossed in a lemon basil vinaigrette, it’s an easy and delicious salad to serve this summer!_\n\n![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad in a white serving bowl with two spoons and a bowl of the vinaigrette behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-pic-680x1018.jpg)\n\nIn the middle of summer it can be hard to find the motivation to cook, especially on a hot day. On days like those I gravitate towards using the grill to make my favorite [chipotle maple grilled salmon](https://reciperunner.com/chipotle-maple-grilled-salmon/) or [grilled pesto chicken skewers](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-pesto-chicken-skewers/).\n\nI always have to have some sort of refreshing salad to go with whatever I grill. During peach season, especially Colorado peach season, I love to make this Blueberry Peach Feta Salad. It’s sweet from the peaches and blueberries, a little salty from the feta and has a fresh crisp crunch from the Persian cucumbers.\n\nThe salad is tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and is an absolute dream to eat on a hot summer day! It goes great with pretty much any grilled protein and is a wonderful side dish to bring to a barbecue.\n\n ![Ingredients used to make blueberry peach feta salad on a sheet pan.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20972'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nIngredients For Blueberry Peach Feta Salad\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   blueberries\n*   peaches\n*   Persian cucumbers or an English cucumber\n*   feta\n*   lemon\n*   dijon mustard\n*   honey\n*   fresh basil\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl. Serving spoons are next to the salad and a bowl of the vinaigrette is behind it.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20967'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow To Make Blueberry Peach Feta Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nMaking this salad is as easy as making a simple everyday lettuce salad. Dice the peaches, slice the cucumbers, and add them to a serving bowl along with the blueberries.\n\nWhenever I make a recipe with feta, I prefer to use block feta and crumble it myself. I feel that the flavor is better, it isn’t as dry and it doesn’t have any of the anti-caking agent in it that pre-crumbled and pre-shredded cheeses contain. For this salad recipe you can crumble or cube the feta cheese.\n\n ![A gray bowl filled with lemon basil vinaigrette.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20974'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nThe final step is to make the lemon vinaigrette. Combine the lemon juice, dijon, honey, olive oil, salt and pepper in a jar. Thinly slice the fresh basil, otherwise known as chiffonade and add it into the mix. Screw on the lid and shake it until it’s well combined. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad and gently toss everything together. You can eat the salad immediately or refrigerate it until you’re ready to serve.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%201008'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can I make the salad vegan?**\n\nYes. Simply omit the feta and substitute the honey in the lemon vinaigrette with maple syrup. You can also add a can of chickpeas to the salad to make it heartier.\n\n**How long will the salad keep?**\n\nThe salad keeps for a couple days in the refrigerator. You will notice that the peaches will get softer and the feta will start to break down the longer it’s in the fridge, but it still taste great.\n\n**Can I make the salad ahead of time?**\n\nParts of the salad can be made ahead of time. You can cut the peaches and combine them with the cucumbers and blueberries a day ahead of time. The vinaigrette can be made several days ahead of time. I would wait until the day you plan to eat the salad to add in the fresh basil, feta and toss the salad in the vinaigrette.\n\n ![closeup photo of Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers and basil.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%201012'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nIngredient Substitutions\n------------------------\n\n*   **Peaches** – If you aren’t a fan of peaches, substitute them with nectarines.\n*   **Feta** – Goat cheese is a good substitution for feta. You could also use [queso fresco](https://www.thekitchn.com/queso-fresco-the-cheesemonger-91408) or [ricotta salata](https://www.belgioioso.com/Products/Ricotta-Salata)\n*   **Persian Cucumbers** – I love to use Persian cucumbers, which may also be called snacking cucumbers, because they’re extra crunchy and you don’t have to peel them. If you can’t find these, use an English cucumber instead. You may want to scoop out the seeds if you go this route, but you won’t need to peel it.\n*   **Blueberries** – Strawberries or blackberries would be a good substitute for blueberries. As with the blueberries and peaches, make sure they are the sweetest and freshest ones you can find to have the best results with this salad. You may find that the strawberries don’t hold up as long in the salad and get soft.\n*   **Honey** – Substitute with maple syrup.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl with a bowl of lemon basil dressing behind it.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20971'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nMore Peach Salad Recipes\n------------------------\n\n*   [Peach Tomato Caprese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-caprese-salad/)\n*   [Summer Chickpea Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken, Peach, Pecan and Goat Cheese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-chicken-peach-pecan-goat-cheese-salad/)\n*   [Peach, Tomato and Corn Panzanella](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-corn-panzanella/)\n*   [Summer Vegetable Orzo Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-vegetable-orzo-salad/)\n\n**Prep Time** 15 minutes\n\n**Total Time** 15 minutes\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 pint fresh blueberries\n*   2 peaches, diced\n*   2 Persian cucumbers, sliced\n*   1/2 cup crumbled feta\n*   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tablespoon dijon mustard\n*   1 tablespoon honey\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   1 tablespoon finely chopped basil\n*   Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.

It’s sweet from the peaches and blueberries, a little salty from the feta and has a fresh crisp crunch from the Persian cucumbers.\n\nThe salad is tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and is an absolute dream to eat on a hot summer day! It goes great with pretty much any grilled protein and is a wonderful side dish to bring to a barbecue.\n\n ![Ingredients used to make blueberry peach feta salad on a sheet pan.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-ingredients-photo-680x972.jpg)\n\nIngredients For Blueberry Peach Feta Salad\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   blueberries\n*   peaches\n*   Persian cucumbers or an English cucumber\n*   feta\n*   lemon\n*   dijon mustard\n*   honey\n*   fresh basil\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl. Serving spoons are next to the salad and a bowl of the vinaigrette is behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photo-680x967.jpg)\n\nHow To Make Blueberry Peach Feta Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nMaking this salad is as easy as making a simple everyday lettuce salad. Dice the peaches, slice the cucumbers, and add them to a serving bowl along with the blueberries.\n\nWhenever I make a recipe with feta, I prefer to use block feta and crumble it myself. I feel that the flavor is better, it isn’t as dry and it doesn’t have any of the anti-caking agent in it that pre-crumbled and pre-shredded cheeses contain. For this salad recipe you can crumble or cube the feta cheese.\n\n ![A gray bowl filled with lemon basil vinaigrette.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-picture-680x974.jpg)\n\nThe final step is to make the lemon vinaigrette. Combine the lemon juice, dijon, honey, olive oil, salt and pepper in a jar. Thinly slice the fresh basil, otherwise known as chiffonade and add it into the mix. Screw on the lid and shake it until it’s well combined. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad and gently toss everything together. You can eat the salad immediately or refrigerate it until you’re ready to serve.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photographs-680x1008.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can I make the salad vegan?**\n\nYes. Simply omit the feta and substitute the honey in the lemon vinaigrette with maple syrup. You can also add a can of chickpeas to the salad to make it heartier.\n\n**How long will the salad keep?**\n\nThe salad keeps for a couple days in the refrigerator. You will notice that the peaches will get softer and the feta will start to break down the longer it’s in the fridge, but it still taste great.\n\n**Can I make the salad ahead of time?**\n\nParts of the salad can be made ahead of time. You can cut the peaches and combine them with the cucumbers and blueberries a day ahead of time. The vinaigrette can be made several days ahead of time. I would wait until the day you plan to eat the salad to add in the fresh basil, feta and toss the salad in the vinaigrette.\n\n ![closeup photo of Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers and basil.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photos-680x1012.jpg)\n\nIngredient Substitutions\n------------------------\n\n*   **Peaches** – If you aren’t a fan of peaches, substitute them with nectarines.\n*   **Feta** – Goat cheese is a good substitution for feta. You could also use [queso fresco](https://www.thekitchn.com/queso-fresco-the-cheesemonger-91408) or [ricotta salata](https://www.belgioioso.com/Products/Ricotta-Salata)\n*   **Persian Cucumbers** – I love to use Persian cucumbers, which may also be called snacking cucumbers, because they’re extra crunchy and you don’t have to peel them. If you can’t find these, use an English cucumber instead. You may want to scoop out the seeds if you go this route, but you won’t need to peel it.\n*   **Blueberries** – Strawberries or blackberries would be a good substitute for blueberries. As with the blueberries and peaches, make sure they are the sweetest and freshest ones you can find to have the best results with this salad. You may find that the strawberries don’t hold up as long in the salad and get soft.\n*   **Honey** – Substitute with maple syrup.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl with a bowl of lemon basil dressing behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photograph-680x971.jpg)\n\nMore Peach Salad Recipes\n------------------------\n\n*   [Peach Tomato Caprese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-caprese-salad/)\n*   [Summer Chickpea Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken, Peach, Pecan and Goat Cheese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-chicken-peach-pecan-goat-cheese-salad/)\n*   [Peach, Tomato and Corn Panzanella](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-corn-panzanella/)\n*   [Summer Vegetable Orzo Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-vegetable-orzo-salad/)\n\n**Prep Time** 15 minutes\n\n**Total Time** 15 minutes\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 pint fresh blueberries\n*   2 peaches, diced\n*   2 Persian cucumbers, sliced\n*   1/2 cup crumbled feta\n*   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tablespoon dijon mustard\n*   1 tablespoon honey\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   1 tablespoon finely chopped basil\n*   Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Best EVER Spinach Orzo Salad - Barefeet In The Kitchen\nThis Spinach Orzo Salad is filled with cranberries, creamy goat cheese, tender pasta, and plenty of fresh spinach tossed in a tangy sweet dressing. The salad can be served immediately or kept in the refrigerator for 2-3 days – making this an awesome make-ahead meal for lunch or dinner.\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese in mixing bowl](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-6-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n#### Spinach Salad with Cranberries\n\nThe recipe was inspired by the Cranberry Orzo Salad that Princess Cruises serves in their International Cafe. It’s just so good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh, and delicious.\n\nI’ve included more cruise details at the bottom of the post here for anyone who is interested. As soon as I got home from [our cruise through the British Isles](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/monets-garden/), I immediately recreated the salad for my family.\n\nAs always, I loved the salad, but my guys? The kids decided that the fresh cranberries were too tart. (Crazy kids!)\n\nSo, the next time I made the salad, I went with dried cranberries and it was a win across the board. I like this salad every bit as much with dried cranberries as I do with fresh cranberries – and that’s an even bigger win, since fresh cranberries aren’t available more than a few weeks a year.\n\n(And unless you’re lucky enough to have [cranberries stashed in the freezer for this cake](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/cranberry-christmas-cake/), you’ll be stuck waiting until the holidays to try this awesome salad.)\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese - close up photo](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-2-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\nI took our salad to the next level by adding a generous portion of fresh baby spinach and warm chicken. Both the chicken and the spinach made it a heartier meal for my family.\n\nAnd as far as my guys are concerned, when I include meat that immediately elevates a pasta salad from side dish to main dish status.\n\nFor what it’s worth though, the chicken in this salad really is optional, the salad is delicious without it. I might even prefer it that way myself.\n\n![spinach salad with orzo, cranberries, and goat cheese](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-3-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\n### Spinach Orzo Salad Recipe\n\n_You’ll need the following ingredients to make this:_\n\n*   olive oil\n*   orzo pasta\n*   baby spinach\n*   sliced almonds\n*   dried cranberries\n*   crumbled goat cheese\n*   chicken, optional\n\n**Dressing Ingredients**\n\n*   olive oil\n*   white balsamic vinegar\n*   honey\n*   salt and pepper\n\n_I’ve used both plain goat cheese and a honey goat cheese for this pasta and they’re both delicious._\n\n_However, I really loved the added flavor from the hint of honey in the specialty goat cheese. If you can find it at your store, give it a try!_\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with almonds and cranberries](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-4-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n### Orzo Spinach Salad\n\nTo make this salad, you’ll begin by toasting the orzo over medium heat, about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add 4 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer, and cover with a lid for 7-8 minutes. Drain any liquid, fluff with fork.\n\nPlace the spinach in a large mixing bowl. Add the cooked orzo, cranberries, almonds, and cooked chicken – if desired.\n\nIn a small bowl or large measuring cup, combine the oil, vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well to coat.\n\nTop with goat cheese and toss lightly. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\n\n![orzo salad with spinach ](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-5-1-of-1-732x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Easy Salads with Spinach\n\nFresh sweet berries, crisp greens, crunchy pecans and a drizzle of creamy poppyseed dressing all add up to one of our favorite summer berry salads. While my boys haven’t always been the biggest salad fans, when this [Berry Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/berry-salad-recipe/) and [Poppyseed Dressing](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/creamy-poppyseed-dressing-recipe/) are on the table they are very happy to eat their salads.\n\nCrisp baby spinach, spring mix lettuces, tart apples, sweet raisins, crunchy almonds, and the ultimate honey cider salad dressing are combined to create a fantastic [Spinach Apple Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/carvers-salad-with-honey-cider-dressing/).\n\n[Strawberry Spinach Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/strawberry-spinach-salad/) is the perfect salad for a summer night. Packed with fresh greens and sweet strawberries, this salad is finished with sliced almonds for just the right amount of crunch.\n\nThis [Spinach Pasta Salad with Tomatoes](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/spinach-pasta-salad-recipe/) is a tangy, garlicky, peppery pasta salad that I can’t seem to stop making and eating on repeat. The combination of crisp, fresh spinach with the chewy pasta and the tangy dressing is simply irresistible.\n\nGet New Recipessent to your inbox!\n\nWe never share your information with third parties and will protect it in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/disclosure-and-privacy-policy/).\n\nServings: 6\n\n*   ▢ ½ tablespoon light olive oil\n*   ▢ 8 ounces orzo pasta\n*   ▢ 4 cups fresh baby spinach, roughly chopped\n*   ▢ ½ cup sliced almonds\n*   ▢ ½ cup Craisins or dried cranberries\n*   ▢ 2-4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\n*   ▢ Optional: 2 cups cooked chicken, chopped bite-size\n\n#### Dressing Ingredients\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup olive oil, divided\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoons white balsamic or champagne vinegar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon honey\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n*   Toast the orzo in ½ tablespoon oil over medium heat, about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add 4 cups water, and bring to a boil.

After hearing about it so much, the next time it was available, I had to try it.\n\nIt was so very good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh. and delicious.\n\nThe [International Cafe](https://www.princess.com/ships-and-experience/ships/products/dining-included/international-cafe.html) is part of the all-inclusive dining options onboard each cruise ship. The cafe is open 24 hours a day and it’s one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat each time we cruise.\n\nThe morning selections include pastries and fresh croissants, breakfast sandwiches, quiche, fresh fruit, yogurt parfaits, and more. Later in the day, you’ll find a selection of small-bite meals and other sweet and savory treats.\n\nThe selections change daily, so when you find your favorite food there, you’ll want to make the most of it.\n\nAsk me how I know this? <_cough> Nutella donuts <cough>_ I cruised 3x before I managed to snag a much-talked-about Nutella donut and it didn’t disappoint. I’ve learned now to check the selections daily.\n\nEdited to add: I cruised the Caribbean with my sister Jenny a couple of years ago and as soon as we were on the ship for our last cruise (literally, as soon as we embarked), she and I stopped by the International Cafe and picked up some of the pasta salad, along with a sandwich, and a couple of coffees to take to our room and snack on as we were getting unpacked and settled.\n\nI’m happy to tell you that Princess’s Cranberry Orzo Salad was every bit as delicious as I remembered. And fortunately, now we can all enjoy it at home too.\n\nWant to check out more of our [Medallion Class cruise](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/ocean-medallion/) through the Caribbean?

    "markdown": "# Spinach Salad with Pears, Pecans and Goat Cheese\nWho says salads have to be boring? This spinach salad with pears, pecans and goat cheese is easy to make and delicious!\n\n![A beige bowl full of spinach pear salad.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-with-goat-cheese.jpg)\n\nThis spinach pear salad isn't exactly new or ground-breaking, but it's really delicious.\n\nEven back when I didn't really enjoying eating salads, I would happily eat this one. The combination of sweet baby spinach, crunchy toasted pecans and juicy pears works together so well, you might even be able to convert the salad haters in your life!\n\n![A beige bowl with baby spinach, slices of pear, crumbled goat cheese and pecan peices.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-with-pecans.jpg)\n\n🍐 Ingredients\n--------------\n\nThis recipe is simple, but packs a ton of flavour. Here's what I used in my salad.\n\n*   Baby Spinach\n*   Pears\n*   Pecans\n*   Goat Cheese\n\nFor the dressing, I wanted a balance of sweet and tangy flavours. To achieve that, I went with a balsamic and Dijon mustard vinaigrette. Feel free to use your favourite homemade or store-bought vinaigrette instead, though.\n\n🥬 Substitutions\n----------------\n\nWhile baby spinach works best in this recipe, you can also make it with flat-leaf (also known as smooth leaf) spinach. This is a sweet type of spinach that is best served raw, and it's usually what you'll find in bags at the grocery store.\n\nI would avoid using savoy spinach (the crinkly ones), as those can be bitter and benefit from being cooked.\n\nFor the pears, you have a few options. Bartletts, [the most-common pear worldwide](https://www.ontario.ca/foodland/food/pears), have a soft juicy texture that works well in this spinach salad. If you prefer a firmer texture, a Bosc or Green Anjou pear would be good options.\n\nYou can substitute walnuts, sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds for the pecans, and blue cheese or feta for the goat cheese.\n\n![An overhead view of a beige bowl of spinach pecan salad with pears and goat cheese.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad.jpg)\n\n🥗 Making the Salad\n-------------------\n\nThis salad is super easy to prepare, even if you toast your own pecans and make the vinaigrette from scratch.\n\nIf you opt to buy pre-washed baby spinach, pre-toasted nuts and a bottled vinaigrette, you're that much closer to eating!\n\nEssentially, once you've washed your produce, all that's left to do is slice your pears, chop your pecans, and crumble your cheese. Assemble, top with your dressing, and you're ready to eat!\n\nIt's important to note that you don't have to peel the pears if you don't want to. Not only does this save time, but [the skin is also a good source of fibre](https://usapears.org/fiber/). Just be sure to give your pears a good wash before cutting them up.\n\nIf the skin on your pears is very tough (which is sometimes the case when you buy them out of season) you can go ahead and peel them. I had to do that when I took the photos for this recipe.\n\nI hope you try making this salad, and if you do let me know what you think of it in the comments below!\n\n🖨 Printable Recipe\n-------------------\n\n![A beige bowl with baby spinach, slices of pear, crumbled goat cheese and pecans.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-featured-image-360x360.jpg)\n\nThis delicious spinach salad gets crunch from toasted pecans, creaminess from goat cheese and sweetness from juicy ripe pears!\n\nPREP TIME: 15 minutes\n\nTOTAL TIME: 15 minutes\n\nSERVINGS: 4 Servings\n\n[PRINT RECIPE](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wprm_print/spinach-pear-salad-with-pecans-and-goat-cheese) [SAVE RECIPE](https://app.grow.me/) [RATE RECIPE](#commentform)\n\n#### For the Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ ½ cup olive oil\n*   ▢ ¼ cup balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, optional (helps to emulsify the dressing)\n*   ▢ pinch of salt and pepper\n\n#### For the Salad:\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups baby spinach, washed and dried\n*   ▢ ½ cup pecans, toasted and chopped\n*   ▢ 2 large ripe pears, washed and sliced into wedges (peeling optional)\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup plain goat cheese, crumbled\n\n#### For the Dressing:\n\n*   Place all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until combined. Alternatively, you can add the ingredients to a mason jar, screw the lid on tightly, and shake to combine.\n    \n\n#### For the Salad:\n\n*   Place spinach and pecans in a large bowl. Add a few spoonfuls of dressing, then use your hands to toss the salad to combine the ingredients. Add the pear slices to the salad, and toss again, gently.\n    \n*   Divide the salad among serving plates, and top with goat cheese and extra dressing as needed. Serve immediately.\n    \n\nIf you don't want to make the salad dressing, you can try this recipe with your favourite store-bought vinaigrette, or a simple homemade oil and vinegar vinaigrette. \n\nSubstitutions:\n\n*   Use flat-leaf (or smooth-leaf) spinach instead of baby spinach. Avoid crinkly savoy spinach, as it's best eaten cooked. \n*   Bartlett pears are great if you want a lot of juice and sweetness. Bosc or Green Anjou pears are better options if you want more crunch.\n*   Walnuts, sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds can be used instead of pecans.\n*   Blue cheese or feta can be used instead of goat cheese. \n\nPlease read the blog post for detailed tips and explanations.\n\nCourse: Salad\n\nCuisine: Canadian\n\nCalories: 453 kcal\n\nCalories: 453kcal | Carbohydrates: 20g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 40g | Saturated Fat: 7g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 6g | Monounsaturated Fat: 26g | Cholesterol: 9mg | Sodium: 136mg | Potassium: 514mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 12g | Vitamin A: 5852IU | Vitamin C: 21mg | Calcium: 108mg | Iron: 3mg\n\nNutrition Disclaimer: this nutritional information is only an estimate.

Here’s the rundown on how to make it:\n\n![Lemon Arugula and Couscous Salad with Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1-1200.jpg)\n\n**The base of our salad is couscous** — we particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous). It cooks quickly and **gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself**. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, barley, or other grains — farro is excellent in salads (see our [apple, arugula, and farro salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/43230/farro-salad-with-apples/) for inspiration).\n\nAdd crisp **cucumbers**, baby **arugula** (or other tender greens), and **feta** cheese to the couscous. The lemon vinaigrette is simple — just lemon juice, olive oil, and a little honey.\n\n**Tip:** Since the dressing is so simple, it’s easy to play with. If we have it on hand, we love throwing a tablespoon of minced preserved lemon to the party. You can buy it or make your own — we shared this [recipe for preserved lemon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/5543/olives-with-lemon-confit-and-chili-flakes/) a while back if you want to take a look.\n\n![Adding lemon vinaigrette to couscous for the arugula and couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arugula-Salad-Recipe-3-1200.jpg)\n\n**The real trick to this salad is assembling it:** toss most of the dressing with the warm couscous and let it cool slightly before adding other ingredients. We take the same approach when making potato salad (we toss warm potatoes with the dressing first). By doing this, the warm ingredient has a chance to absorb all the flavor in the dressing. A game changer.\n\nThe same idea applies if you swap the couscous for pasta or another grain. Toss the still-warm pasta/grain with the dressing first, let it absorb, and cool slightly. Then, move on to adding the rest of the ingredients.\n\n**This arugula salad would go really well next to** this [Seriously Good Turkey Burger](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/34790/seriously-good-turkey-burger/), our [Easy Lemon Garlic Baked Chicken Breasts](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28703/lemon-garlic-baked-chicken-breast-recipe/) and our [Perfectly Baked Salmon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/149/moms-oven-poached-salmon/) (inspired by my Mom).\n\n![Lemon Arugula Salad with Couscous, Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1200.jpg)\n\n**For more arugula recipes**, take a look at our [Fried Goat Cheese, Strawberry and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/648/fried-goat-cheese-arugula-salad/), our [Lemony White Bean and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/42176/white-bean-salad/), this lovely [Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad Recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12907/shaved-fennel-and-arugula-salad-recipe/) and these [Baked Chicken Thighs with Potatoes, Garlic and Arugula](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28824/baked-chicken-thighs-with-potatoes/).\n\nLemon Arugula Salad with Couscous and Feta\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   PREP 10mins\n*   COOK 10mins\n*   TOTAL 20mins\n\nOur arugula salad, made with an easy lemon vinaigrette, pearl couscous, cucumbers, and feta, is crave-worthy. Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again. We particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous) for this arugula salad. It cooks quickly and gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, or other cooked grains like barley or wheat berries.\n\nMakes 4 large servings\n\nWatch Us Make the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nYou Will Need\n-------------\n\nFor the Salad\n\n1 ½ cups dried pearl (Israeli) couscous, _about 3 cups cooked_\n\n3 ounces baby arugula or tender salad greens, _about 4 cups_\n\nHalf of a hothouse (seedless) cucumber, chopped\n\n2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled, _about 1/2 cup_\n\nFor the Dressing\n\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, _about 1/2 large lemon_\n\n4 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup\n\n1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon, _optional_\n\n1 teaspoon dried basil or a handful chopped fresh basil leaves, _optional_\n\nSea salt and fresh ground black pepper\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n1Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add couscous and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, then add to a large bowl.\n\n2Meanwhile, make the lemon vinaigrette. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, honey, preserved lemon, and basil until it looks thick and blended. Season to taste with salt and fresh ground black pepper (we add a generous pinch of each).\n\n3Toss the cooked and drained couscous with the dressing, then set aside for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly. Finish the salad by adding the arugula, cucumbers, and feta. Toss well, then serve.\n\nAdam and Joanne's Tips\n----------------------\n\n*   The salad will keep overnight in the fridge. As it sits, the greens may wilt slightly, but still will taste great.\n*   If you cannot find pearl (Israeli) couscous, substitute with a regular couscous, small pasta shape such as orzo or cooked grains like quinoa, wheat berries and barley.\n*   Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates. We have used the USDA database to calculate approximate values. We assumed 1/2 teaspoon of added salt.\n\n_If you make this recipe, snap a photo and hashtag it #inspiredtaste — We love to see your creations on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/inspiredtaste/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/inspiredtaste)!

I love freshly sliced peaches, but have you ever tried grilling them? If not, you have to do it soon!\n\n**Grilling peaches intensifies their sweetness** by caramelizing the natural sugars and adding a little bit of smokiness. In this grilled peach salad, the combination of warm peaches with crisp mixed greens and fresh berries is beyond delicious!\n\nGrilled peach salad is perhaps my favorite summer salad, and it’s **really easy to make**! The only “cooking” part involved is grilling the peaches, which takes just 8 minutes or less. In total, it takes about 20 minutes to make, so it’s a quick recipe.\n\nEvery ingredient adds so much **texture, flavor, and balance**.

It’s very easy and straightforward, and I also share tips and tricks on how to prevent them sticking to the grill.\n\n1.  **Preheat grill to medium-high heat:** Preheating is VERY important. If the grill grates are hot, the peaches will start developing grill marks immediately, which minimizes sticking. Oil the grates.\n2.  **Cut the peaches**, either into quarters or halves (remove the pit). **Brush** the flat side of the peaches, as well as the grill grates, with olive oil.\n3.  **Grill** cut-side down for 2 to 3 minutes UNDISTURBED per side. Removing them from the grill too early will cause them to stick.\n\n**How to Prevent Peaches from Sticking to Grill**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Find peaches that are ripe but also firm.** They need to be firm so they don’t get mushy, but also ripe for sweetness.\n*   **Size matters.** Bigger pieces of fruit work better. I’d recommend peach halves or quarters.\n*   Make sure the grill grates are **clean**.\n*   **Use medium-high heat.** This minimizes sticking to the grill. Brush the grill grates and peaches with **olive oil**.\n*   **Let them grill undisturbed** to get more defined grill marks. Check after 2-3 minutes and flip when ready.\n*   **Use a thin spatula:** It’s best to use a thin spatula to lift the peaches from underneath. Using tongs to flip peaches on the grill can sometimes rip the grill marks apart.\n*   **Outdoor grill, stovetop grill pan, or indoor electric grill:** I prefer cast iron, but if you’re worried about the fruit sticking to the grill, you can use a nonstick.\n\n![grilled peaches on mixed greens, berries, feta, and candied pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad2-min.jpg)\n\n**Ingredient Notes**\n--------------------\n\nGrilled peach salad is made with lots of great seasonal summer ingredients! Below I share a few ingredient notes from recipe testing. As always, the full ingredient quantity list can be found in the recipe card down below.\n\n**For the salad:**\n\n*   **Fresh peaches:** They should be ripe but firm. They need to be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but also relatively firm so that they don’t fall apart on the grill. The larger the peaches, the better.\n*   **Olive oil:** Brushing the peaches with olive oil helps prevent sticking.\n*   **Berries:** Use any fresh berries of your choice. Blackberries are my favorite for this recipe.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Choose a variety of mixed greens such as baby spinach, arugula, and romaine lettuce for texture.\n*   **Feta crumbles:** Adds fresh savory flavors. Other great choices are goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, and burrata cheese.\n\n**For the balsamic dressing:**\n\n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** For acidity and flavor.\n*   **Olive oil:** Use good extra virgin olive oil for better taste.\n*   **Minced garlic:** For flavor.\n*   **Honey:** To add sweetness and balance out the acidity.\n*   **Dijon mustard:** To help the vinegar and oil emulsify.\n*   **Salt and pepper** to taste\n\n![ingredients including water, salt, brown sugar, pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-balsamic-dressing-labeled.jpg)\n\n**For the Candied pecans:**\n\n**Brown sugar:** For sweetness. I use light brown sugar.  \n**Water:** To help the brown sugar melt and to thin it out.  \n**Pecan halves:** You can also use walnuts, if you prefer.  \n**A pinch of salt:** helps balance out the sweetness.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions**\n-----------------------------\n\nThis grilled peach salad takes about 20 minutes to make. Here’s a tutorial so you can see how easy it is!\n\n### **Step 1 | Make the candied pecans**\n\nIn a small skillet, melt the brown sugar with the water over medium-low heat. Add the pecan halves plus a pinch of salt. Stir to coat for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Want to spice them up? Add a little bit of ground cinnamon or cayenne pepper.\n\n![candied pecans in a small non-stick skillet](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/candied-pecans-for-salad-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 2 | Make the balsamic dressing**\n\nIn a mason jar, combine all the balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar and shake vigorously until emulsified or evenly combined.\n\n![prepared balsamic dressing in a mason jar](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/homemade-balsamic-peach-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 3 | Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n[Cut the peaches](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/) into thick wedges or halves, making sure they are about the same size (remove the pit).\n\nGet your grill preheated to medium-high. Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Brush the peaches with olive oil to prevent them from sticking. Grill the peaches on each flat side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed, or until they develop grill marks. Using a thin spatula, flip and grill the other side for another 2-3 minutes.\n\n### **Step 4 | Assemble the peach salad**\n\nArrange a bed of mixed greens on a large platter. Top with the berries, the prepared candied pecans, crumbled feta, and grilled peaches. Drizzle the assembled grilled peach salad with the prepared balsamic dressing…and ENJOY!\n\n**Prep Ahead Tips**\n-------------------\n\nI wouldn’t recommend making the entire peach salad in advance, but you can certainly prep a few components ahead. If you do this, you can make the entire salad in less than 20 minutes!\n\n*   **Make the candied pecans the day before** and let them cool on the counter overnight. Keep them in a container or in a covered bowl.\n*   **Make the balsamic dressing** up to 2 days in advance and refrigerate. Before using, let it sit at room temp and shake it vigorously again before using.\n*   **Note:** I wouldn’t recommend cutting the peaches until ready to grill. They will release lots of juices, and turn soft and brown overnight.\n\n**Substitutions and Variations**\n--------------------------------\n\nHere are my favorite substitutions for my grilled peach salad:\n\n*   **Greens:** I use a simple blend of mixed greens. You can also use baby spinach, arugula, or your favorite lettuce. For some crunch, use romaine or little gem lettuce.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts work great too! Also try toasted pine nuts, pistachios, or almonds.\n*   **Peaches:** If you can’t find peaches, nectarines are a great substitute.\n*   **Berries:** Mix and match! Try blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Cheese**: Try goat cheese, gorgonzola, blue cheese, mozzarella, or burrata.\n*   **Dressing:** For a creamier texture, try my [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://cookingformysoul.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/). Other great dressings are raspberry vinaigrette and basil vinaigrette.\n*   **Other favorite add-ins:** Avocado, fresh grilled corn, prosciutto, pickled red onions.\n\n![grilled peaches with berries, mixed greens, pecans, and feta](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad4-min.jpg)\n\n**Pairings and Serving Ideas**\n------------------------------\n\nServe this grilled peach salad with [grilled chicken breast](https://cookingformysoul.com/easy-lemon-chicken-marinade/) to make it a whole meal!

Apricots may be a bit too small to grill properly, but you can.\n\n**Do you peel the peaches?**\n\nI personally prefer to keep the skin on, but you can peel them off if desired. I provide instructions in my [peach prep tutorial](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/).\n\n**How can I prevent the peaches from sticking to the grill?**\n\nMake sure the grill is HOT, brush the sliced peaches with oil, let them cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes before flipping, and use a thin spatula to lift and release the peaches from underneath the grill. Try not to use tongs.\n\n**Can I make this salad ahead?**\n\nGrilled peaches don’t store well, so I’d say no. However, you can make the balsamic dressing and the candied pecans in advance.\n\n**Tips for Success**\n--------------------\n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for sweetness but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **Don’t overcook** the peaches on the grill to prevent them from becoming mushy.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:** 1) Make sure the grill is HOT, 2) brush peaches with oil, and 3) let them grill undisturbed. 4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath. This will help maintain the grill marks on the peaches.\n\nI’d love to hear from you! If you loved my recipe, please consider leaving a 5-star rating and a comment down below.

Set aside.\n    \n\n#### **Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n*   [**Cut the peaches**](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/)**:** Insert a sharp knife along the natural line coming from the stem of the peach until you hit the pit in the center, and cut in half in this direction by rotating it around the knife. Separate each half and remove the pit. Then, cut each half into 2 or 3 thick wedges.\n    \n*   **Grill the peaches:** Preheat grill to medium-high heat (it needs to be hot to minimize sticking) and oil the grates. Brush the sliced peaches on both sides with some olive oil. Grill each side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed to allow grill marks to develop. Once ready, transfer to a plate. _**Tip:**_ _To flip the peaches, use a thin spatula and lift the peach from underneath to preserve the grill marks. Try not to use tongs._\n    \n\n#### **Assemble the salad**\n\n*   On a large platter, arrange a bed of mixed greens and top with the blackberries, blueberries, grilled peaches, candied pecans, and crumbled feta. Drizzle with the prepared honey balsamic vinegar to taste. Enjoy!\n    \n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:**  \n    1) Make sure the grill is preheated  \n    2) Brush the peaches and grill grates with olive oil  \n    3) Let them cook undisturbed until they get grill marks  \n    4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath. This will help maintain the grill marks on the peaches.\n*   **Prep ahead:** The dressing can be made up to 2 or 3 days in advance. The candied pecans can also be made up to 2 days ahead.  \n    Store leftovers in a container in the fridge for up to 3 days.\n\n**Substitutions:**\n\n*   **Peaches**: nectarines.\n*   **Berries:** Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Romaine, arugula, or a mix of various greens.\n\n_Nutritional values per serving are estimates only._\n\nCalories: 356kcal | Carbohydrates: 30g | Protein: 6g | Fat: 26g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 7mg | Sodium: 237mg | Potassium: 282mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 24g | Vitamin A: 636IU | Vitamin C: 14mg | Calcium: 34mg | Iron: 1mg"

These black beans give you a little change up and introduce a little sweet and spice thanks to the ginger.\n*   The dressing that goes along with it helps add to the simple flavors of the sautéed black beans and shallots.\n*   This bowl also happens to be **vegan, gluten-free and nut free!** It’s also pretty easy to customize to preference.\n*   **Takes less than 30 minutes to make** and is **super easy to through together** for a quick meal.\n\n**Key Ingredients**\n-------------------\n\n*   **Ginger:** We use both fresh and dried for this recipe\n*   **Garlic:** Also, both fresh and dried\n*   **Black Beans:** Canned to make this come together quickly\n*   **Soy Sauce:** For some simple umami flavors\n*   **Lime:** A bright burst of citrus flavor to complement the ginger and sriracha\n*   **Tahini:** For the creamy factor of the dressing\n*   **Sriracha:** Get a little nice spicy element to the dish\n\n**How to make this nourish bowl**\n---------------------------------\n\nStart by prepping your beans. Rinse and drain your beans really well and set aside. In a pan, start by sautéing your shallots with a little oil until mostly softened. Then add in your garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant.\n\n*   ![Pan with sauced shallots and black beans.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_1.jpg)\n    \n*   ![black beans being stirred together with spinach.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_2.jpg)\n    \n\nThrow in your beans and continue to sauté to help incorporate more of the garlic and ginger flavors with the beans. Add in spinach and a little soy sauce and allow spinach to wilt.\n\n*   ![Ginger sriracha sauce being mixed together in a jar.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_3.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Bowl of ginger black beans with rice and sliced cucumber topped with ginger sriracha sauce and cilantro.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_4.jpg)\n    \n\nPrepare the sauce by mixing all of the dressing ingredients together. Adjust consistency by adding small amounts of water at a time until desired consistency is achieved.\n\n**Tips for making the perfect bowl**\n------------------------------------\n\n*   Canned beans make this dish come together really fast. It’s important to make sure you rinse your beans really well to remove the sauce that coats them. Not only will it make it easier to sauté the beans with your shallots and ginger, but it will also remove excess starches that are responsible for excess gas in your guts.\n*   Make sure you use a good quality tahini for your dressing. Good quality tahini should not taste bitter. It should be mild and smooth, so that it has an easier time highlighting the main flavors without taking away from them. My preferred brand is by Soom Foods.\n\n**How long will the dressing keep for?**\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe dressing can be stored in an airtight container or jar for up to 4 days. Before using after refrigeration, give it a good stir and adjust consistency with additional water if needed. Make sure to use very little additional water as the dressing will loosen up a little bit more as it comes to room temperature.\n\n**What to pair with your beans in your nourish bowl**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe beans and sauce go really well with rice or quinoa. You can also add in some baked tofu for more protein if desired. Cooling vegetables like cucumber go really well with this bowl as well. Top with some fresh herbs like cilantro and some avocado on the side make for an extra enjoyable bowl.\n\n**More Nourish Bowls to Try**\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Almond Miso Chickpea Nourish Bowl](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/02/almond-miso-chickpea-nourish-bowl/)\n*   [Edamame Crunch Salad](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/03/edamame-crunch-salad-with-sesame-cashew-lime-dressing/)\n*   [Tahini Ranch Tofu Sheet Pan](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/01/tahini-ranch-tofu-sheet-pan/)\n\n![Side of the black bean nourish bowl with a spoon tucked into it.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_5.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/04/black-bean-nourish-bowl/print/4059/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\nThis Black Bean Nourish Bowl gives you a new and fun way to flavor your black beans by using a creamy ginger and sriracha infused dressing.

Capri is an island in Italy and this salad is called ‘Insalata Caprese’ which translates to the salad of Capri.\n\n**Can I omit the balsamic?**\n\nIf you would like to. You can opt to season with only salt, pepper and olive oil. I find this works best when tomatoes are at their peak during the summertime. The balsamic adds additional flavor during months where tomatoes are not in season.\n\n**What kind of tomatoes are best for Caprese?**\n\nFor this chopped Caprese salad, I prefer halved cherry tomatoes although grape tomatoes work as well. If you are layering slices of the salad, heirloom tomatoes are popular.\n\n**Can I substitute the fresh mozzarella cheese?**\n\nFresh mozzarella is a key ingredient in this salad. You could try fresh burrata cheese but I would not use low moisture or part-skim mozzarella as it will change the texture of the salad and add additional salt.\n\n![Tomato basil mozzarella salad in white bowl.](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Caprese-salad-2.jpg \"This easy Caprese salad is filled with ripe tomatoes, mozzarella balls, fresh basil and then topped with a homemade balsamic glaze for the most delicious combination.

Make it once and your family will request it again and again!_\n\n![Overhead closeup view of a white bowl filled with brown rice and topped with basil chicken in coconut curry sauce with extra fresh basil on top and recipe title at top of image](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-New-Lead-683x1024.jpg)\n\n_(This recipe for Basil Chicken in Coconut Curry Sauce was originally published in February 2010, but was updated with new photos in 2019)._\n\nSometimes I spend more time trying to decide what to make for dinner than I do actually making dinner. But when I just can't decide what to make, I usually head over to my favorite blogs and just browse.\n\nYou all know I'm obsessed with Martha Stewart and everything she does, but her website is not easy to navigate for inspiration.\n\nMost blogs are much easier to browse and find yummy dishes to make. One of my favorite blogs to browse is Simply Recipes. I can head over there when I have NO idea what to make and usually come away with at least three ideas in no time at all.\n\nThis time one of those ideas was [Basil Chicken in Coconut Curry Sauce](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/basil_chicken_in_coconut_curry_sauce/). It went on my must-make list immediately. Basil Chicken is good, but basil chicken curry is way, way better, especially if that curry is a coconut curry sauce!\n\nShould I Use Chicken Breasts or Chicken Thighs?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nYou can use either chicken breasts or chicken thighs for this recipe, so it's totally up to you. Though chicken breasts have fewer calories and less fat (including saturated fat) than chicken thighs ([source](https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines-and-myplate/breasts-vs-thighs-which-is-more-nutritious)) and are often more expensive than thighs, a lot of people like the flavor of thighs better.\n\nThough the original basil chicken curry recipe called for thighs, I opted for breasts and I have to tell you that this dish makes chicken breasts taste absolutely incredibly!\n\nI totally get how people often think they're dry, bland, and boring, but this recipe really makes them delicious (if you're looking for another great chicken breast recipe, try my [Panko Crusted Chicken](https://wearenotmartha.com/panko-crusted-chicken/)). That said, I'm absolutely positive thighs would be amazing, too.\n\nIf you happen to have chicken legs on hand, try these [chicken leg quarter recipes](https://www.orwhateveryoudo.com/2020/03/sweet-chili-chicken-leg-quarters.html)!\n\nWhy is There No Curry Powder in This Coconut Curry Sauce?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nA couple people have commented on this recipe and asked why there is no curry powder or garam masala listed in the recipe ingredients. That's because curry powder is really just a blend of spices and rather simply use curry powder here, we're making our own custom spice mixture.\n\nDo you have to do this? Well, no. If you don't have these spices in your pantry and prefer to keep things simple, you can use curry powder or garam masala and end up with a fairly similar recipe.\n\nHowever, I've found that the blend of spices used in this recipe makes my ideal coconut curry sauce, which is why I'm sharing it here.\n\nIn fact, you might try this recipe and decide you'd adjust the spice mixture next time due to your own personal preferences.\n\nFeel free to experiment and come up a spice mixture that appeals to you and your family best!\n\nIs the Curry Sauce Spicy?\n-------------------------\n\nThere are many different kinds of curry sauce and some are spicy and some aren't. This particular coconut curry sauce isn't very spicy (there's just a little chili powder in it), but because there are jalapeño peppers in the dish, it can get a little spicy.\n\nIf you're not a fan of spice or are serving this dish to kids, I recommend being sure to scrape the seeds out of the jalapeños before chopping. The seeds hold most of the heat, so if you just include the pepper part, you'll mainly be getting the flavor.\n\nHowever, you can always cut down on the amount of jalapeño, too.\n\nWith all that said, please don't be intimidated by the seemingly long list of ingredients in this basil chicken curry recipe. Lots of them are spices that you probably already have in your pantry (if not, you should because you'll definitely use them again!).\n\nDespite all those ingredients (spices), this basil chicken in coconut curry sauce is so, so easy.\n\nStart by mixing all those beautiful spices together in a small bowl. Then put your chicken pieces in a large bowl and sprinkle the spice mixture all over it. Let the chicken rest for about 30 minutes.\n\nHeat 1 Tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and jalapeño and cook for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook for one more minute.\n\nRemove the vegetables from the pan and put in a medium sized bowl and set aside.\n\n![Collage showing process for making basil chicken in coconut curry sauce, including curry spices in a white bowl, onion and jalapeño cooking in a skillet, and onion and jalapeño with garlic cooked and resting in a bowl](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-Making.jpg)\n\nUsing the same pan, add another Tbsp of oil and add half of the chicken pieces, spreading them out to make sure they're not overcrowded. Cook for a few minutes on each side to brown.\n\nWhen they're cooked through, remove from the pan and add them to the bowl of onion/jalapeño. Repeat with remaining chicken and remove that to the bowl, too.\n\n![Cubed chicken breasts covered in spice cooking in oil in a skillet](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Chicken-Cooking-2-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nNow for the coconut curry sauce! Add the coconut milk to the skillet and cook on medium-high and stir until it thickens a bit and gets bubbly.\n\nThen mix in the Worcestershire sauce.\n\nAdd the chicken and onion/jalapeño, along with basil and ginger and cook for 2 more minutes.\n\n![Overhead view of coconut curry sauce with chicken and basil cooking in it](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-Cooking-4-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nServe the basil chicken curry over rice... brown is always best! But obviously you can use whatever kind of rice you want. Or even quinoa. Or cauliflower rice.\n\nHeck, eat it right out of the skillet with a spoon if you want with nothing on the side. I won't tell.\n\nOh my goodness, this basil chicken in coconut curry sauce is so incredibly flavorful and satisfying! I didn't scrape the seeds out of my jalapeños (because we love heat in my house!), so this definitely had an extra kick to it.\n\n![Head on view of basil chicken in coconut curry sauce sitting on a bed of brown rice in a white bowl](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-9-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nI also decided to add more fresh basil over the top since I legit love fresh basil so much. And since this dish is called basil chicken curry and all, I figured it needed some extra!\n\nI've never actually attempted making my own curry, but this coconut curry sauce is something I'll most definitely be making again.\n\nThere are sooo many things that can be done with curry and I love it so much.\n\nThere are also so many kinds of curry and I want to make them all!\n\n![Landscape view of a white bowl filled with brown rice that's topped with basil chicken in coconut curry sauce with fresh basil on top](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-3-2-2-1024x683.jpg)\n\nLike I mentioned, you can definitely use chicken thighs for this recipe, but I was really happy I used chicken breasts because they ended up being so moist and flavorful when cooked in the spices and in the coconut curry sauce.\n\nSome people prefer using chicken thighs to breasts because breasts can be drier and less flavorful, but that is not the case with this recipe!\n\nMore Easy Chicken Dinner Recipes\n--------------------------------\n\nThere are so many boring chicken recipes out there, so I've made it one of my goals to only share chicken recipes that are incredibly flavorful and delicious. Oh, and they have to be easy, too!

This **Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini and Squash** is a super easy, super flavorful, one pan chicken and veggie recipe everyone in the family will love! It’s a hearty, bright and lemony dinner that makes great leftovers._\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with lemon wedges and sliced squash](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-2.jpg)\n\nChances are if you’re growing a garden or live by someone growing a garden, then right about now you have a bunch of zucchini and squash you need to use up. This healthy chicken recipe is the perfect use for it!\n\nMy brother, sister and mother-in-law all have gardens (I’m failing this year, someday I need to make time a grow a real deal garden. Last year I had one small box garden, I felt pretty cool) but they are are all generously sharing so much from their gardens (thank you!).\n\nMy brother was just telling me how quickly the zucchini and squash grow and he said he planted way too many, so lucky for me I get a bunch of them too. This skillet chicken recipe will be a new go-to use for all the summer squash and zucchini for me.\n\nThis lemon Parmesan chicken recipe is about as easy as it gets! Just some quick dicing for prep, then the chicken cooks in about 6 minutes and you set that aside and in the same skillet saute the zucchini and squash for about 4 minutes.\n\nThis is how you do simple weeknight dinners! Just be careful not to overcook the veggies as they will go from perfectly tender to mush in what seems like the blink of an eye.\n\nI just can’t get enough of these buttery-herb and lemony, garlic-Parmesan flavors! Make it soon, you’ll be glad you did!\n\nWatch the Video!\n----------------\n\n![Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini and Squash garnished with Parmesan and parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-9.jpg)\n\nLemon Parmesan Chicken Ingredients\n----------------------------------\n\nFor the chicken and zucchini skillet, you’ll need:\n\n*   Chicken breasts\n*   Olive oil\n*   Butter\n*   Salt and pepper\n*   Herbs and spices (Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder)\n*   Lemon zest and juice\n*   Zucchini\n*   Yellow squash\n*   Shredded Parmesan\n*   Fresh parsley\n\nHow to Cook Chicken in a Skillet\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Season diced chicken with herbs, spices and lemon zest, then cook in hot skillet with olive oil and butter.\n*   Transfer cooked chicken to plate and tent with foil to keep warm.\n*   Sauté zucchini and squash in that same skillet, seasoning with the same blend of herbs and spices.\n*   Return chicken to pan and drizzle in lemon juice. Sprinkle on Parmesan and garnish with fresh parsley, then toss to combine.\n*   Serve with your choice of rice, orzo, pasta, and more!\n\nCan I Use Chicken Thighs Instead of Breasts?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYes, you can use any cut of chicken you’d like here. I prefer using boneless, skinless chicken in this recipe, but feel free to use whatever you see fit.\n\nJust keep in mind that you may need to adjust the cook time slightly depending on how large you dice the chicken and what cut of meat you use.\n\nCan I Add More Veggies to This Chicken Skillet?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOf course! Lemon Parmesan chicken pairs well with almost any vegetable. I recommend using seasonal produce that cooks at roughly the same rate as the zucchini and squash (that way you’re not having to take ingredients in and out of the skillet to accommodate different cook times).\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with sliced zucchini and squash garnished with parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-6.jpg)\n\nTips for the Best Skillet Chicken and Veggies\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   Before cooking the chicken, dab it dry — preferably on both sides — and use a hot skillet. Try to give the pieces some space so you can get that nice golden brown sear for added flavor.\n*   Use shredded Parmesan cheese for the best texture and flavor, and not the cheese that comes in a shaker can.\n*   Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the brightest, freshest flavor.\n\nMore Healthy Chicken Recipes You’ll Love:\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*   [Grilled Greek Lemon Chicken](https://www.cookingclassy.com/grilled-cilantro-lime-chicken-with-avocado-salsa/)\n*   [Cilantro Lime Chicken with Avocado Salsa](https://www.cookingclassy.com/baked-sweet-potato-fries/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Hawaiian Chicken](https://www.cookingclassy.com/sheet-pan-hawaiian-chicken/)\n*   [Honey Lime Chicken Skewers](https://www.cookingclassy.com/honey-lime-chicken-skewers/)\n*   [Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps](https://www.cookingclassy.com/thai-chicken-lettuce-wraps/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas](https://www.cookingclassy.com/sheet-pan-chicken-fajitas/)\n\n16 Quick & Easy 30 Minute Recipes!

    "markdown": "# Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini - Cooking Classy\n_A healthy Chicken recipe! This **Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini and Squash** is a super easy, super flavorful, one pan chicken and veggie recipe everyone in the family will love! It’s a hearty, bright and lemony dinner that makes great leftovers._\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with lemon wedges and sliced squash](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-2.jpg)\n\nChances are if you’re growing a garden or live by someone growing a garden, then right about now you have a bunch of zucchini and squash you need to use up. This healthy chicken recipe is the perfect use for it!\n\nMy brother, sister and mother-in-law all have gardens (I’m failing this year, someday I need to make time a grow a real deal garden. Last year I had one small box garden, I felt pretty cool) but they are are all generously sharing so much from their gardens (thank you!).\n\nMy brother was just telling me how quickly the zucchini and squash grow and he said he planted way too many, so lucky for me I get a bunch of them too. This skillet chicken recipe will be a new go-to use for all the summer squash and zucchini for me.\n\nThis lemon Parmesan chicken recipe is about as easy as it gets! Just some quick dicing for prep, then the chicken cooks in about 6 minutes and you set that aside and in the same skillet saute the zucchini and squash for about 4 minutes.\n\nThis is how you do simple weeknight dinners! Just be careful not to overcook the veggies as they will go from perfectly tender to mush in what seems like the blink of an eye.\n\nI just can’t get enough of these buttery-herb and lemony, garlic-Parmesan flavors! Make it soon, you’ll be glad you did!\n\nWatch the Video!\n----------------\n\n![Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini and Squash garnished with Parmesan and parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-9.jpg)\n\nLemon Parmesan Chicken Ingredients\n----------------------------------\n\nFor the chicken and zucchini skillet, you’ll need:\n\n*   Chicken breasts\n*   Olive oil\n*   Butter\n*   Salt and pepper\n*   Herbs and spices (Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder)\n*   Lemon zest and juice\n*   Zucchini\n*   Yellow squash\n*   Shredded Parmesan\n*   Fresh parsley\n\nHow to Cook Chicken in a Skillet\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Season diced chicken with herbs, spices and lemon zest, then cook in hot skillet with olive oil and butter.\n*   Transfer cooked chicken to plate and tent with foil to keep warm.\n*   Sauté zucchini and squash in that same skillet, seasoning with the same blend of herbs and spices.\n*   Return chicken to pan and drizzle in lemon juice. Sprinkle on Parmesan and garnish with fresh parsley, then toss to combine.\n*   Serve with your choice of rice, orzo, pasta, and more!\n\nCan I Use Chicken Thighs Instead of Breasts?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYes, you can use any cut of chicken you’d like here. I prefer using boneless, skinless chicken in this recipe, but feel free to use whatever you see fit.\n\nJust keep in mind that you may need to adjust the cook time slightly depending on how large you dice the chicken and what cut of meat you use.\n\nCan I Add More Veggies to This Chicken Skillet?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOf course! Lemon Parmesan chicken pairs well with almost any vegetable. I recommend using seasonal produce that cooks at roughly the same rate as the zucchini and squash (that way you’re not having to take ingredients in and out of the skillet to accommodate different cook times).\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with sliced zucchini and squash garnished with parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-6.jpg)\n\nTips for the Best Skillet Chicken and Veggies\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   Before cooking the chicken, dab it dry — preferably on both sides — and use a hot skillet. Try to give the pieces some space so you can get that nice golden brown sear for added flavor.\n*   Use shredded Parmesan cheese for the best texture and flavor, and not the cheese that comes in a shaker can.\n*   Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the brightest, freshest flavor.\n\nMore Healthy Chicken Recipes You’ll Love:\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*   [Grilled Greek Lemon Chicken](https://www.cookingclassy.com/grilled-cilantro-lime-chicken-with-avocado-salsa/)\n*   [Cilantro Lime Chicken with Avocado Salsa](https://www.cookingclassy.com/baked-sweet-potato-fries/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Hawaiian Chicken](https://www.cookingclassy.com/sheet-pan-hawaiian-chicken/)\n*   [Honey Lime Chicken Skewers](https://www.cookingclassy.com/honey-lime-chicken-skewers/)\n*   [Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps](https://www.cookingclassy.com/thai-chicken-lettuce-wraps/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas](https://www.cookingclassy.com/sheet-pan-chicken-fajitas/)\n\n16 Quick & Easy 30 Minute Recipes!

My personal favorite is Yukon gold mashed potatoes because they are rich, flavorful, and super creamy when mashed. Russet potatoes will be lighter and fluffier. Or, get the best of both worlds and use half Yukon gold and half Russet potatoes. You can also use red potatoes, but the mashed potatoes will be heavier and less creamy and fluffy.\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n![recipe ingredients: chopped yukon gold potatoes, butter, milk and salt in bowls](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mashed-potatoes-ingredients-488.jpg?resize=1800%2C1200&ssl=1 \"Mashed potatoes ingredients. The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\n*   **Potatoes:** Yukon golds or Russets.\n*   **Butter:** You want the butter to be softened but not melted. Room temperature butter will melt into the potatoes easily.\n*   **Salt and Pepper:** You’ll add some salt to the cooking water and then more salt, to taste, after cooking. \n*   **Milk:** Whole milk makes the best rich and creamy mashed potatoes, but you can use skim milk if that’s what you have on hand. Warm the milk before stirring it into the potatoes. This keeps the potatoes from cooling off too much and helps to make creamy potatoes.\n\nHow to Make Mashed Potatoes\n---------------------------\n\n_Here’s an overview of the recipe steps. Find the full recipe with ingredient amounts and instructions in the recipe card below._\n\nScrub the potatoes. Whether or not to peel the potatoes is up to you. I usually peel Russet potatoes but not Yukon golds. Yukon gold potatoes have thin skins and the skins add nice texture.\n\nCut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Try to make the pieces about the same size so that they will cook evenly. Put the potatoes in a pot of cold water and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat.\n\nHow Long to Boil Potatoes for Mashed Potatoes\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBoil potatoes for 12-15 minutes, until they are very tender when pierced with a fork. To avoid lumpy potatoes, be sure to cook them until very tender. However, you don’t want to cook the potatoes so much that they are falling apart.\n\nPour the potatoes into a colander and drain them well. Then put the potatoes back into the hot pot for 2-3 minutes to allow extra moisture to evaporate.  This step gives you fluffier, creamier mashed potatoes.\n\n![side by side photos: potatoes and butter in pot and mashed potatoes, milk, salt and pepper in pot](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes.jpg?resize=1205%2C900&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\nAdd the butter and use a potato masher to mash the potatoes. The butter will melt into the potatoes as you mash them. Stir in the warm milk. Potatoes can vary in how thirsty they are, so add milk until the mashed potatoes reach your desired creaminess. Season to taste with salt and pepper, serve and enjoy!\n\nRecipe Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Start the potatoes in cold water and then bring it to a boil. Using a cold start promotes even cooking, so the outsides of the potatoes won’t overcook by the time the insides are done. Even cooking is also why you want to cut potatoes before boiling, instead of boiling them whole. \n*   Adding salt to the cooking water flavors the potatoes from the beginning. It really does make a difference!\n*   To avoid lumps, cook the potatoes until they are very soft and tender when pierced with a fork or knife. Lumpy mashed potatoes are usually caused by mashing undercooked potatoes.\n*   I recommend mashing your potatoes by hand for fluffy mashed potatoes. Using an electric mixer is easy, but it can result in a gummy or gluey texture because it makes it too easy to overwork the potatoes. The same goes for when you are mashing and stirring by hand – be careful to not overwork the potatoes.\n*   Be sure to use softened butter and warm milk (or cream).\n\n![serving dish with mashed potatoes topped with melted butter and chives](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mashed-potatoes-recipe-474.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\nHow to Reheat Mashed Potatoes\n-----------------------------\n\n*   Potatoes tend to dry out over time, so **add more milk** to make them creamy again.\n*   **In the microwave:** Microwave on high power, stirring occasionally, until hot. Add more milk as needed.\n*   **In the oven:** Stir a bit of milk into the potatoes and put them in a baking dish. Cover with foil and bake at 350° F until hot, stirring once or twice.\n*   **Make ahead:** You can make this recipe up to two hours ahead and then keep the potatoes warm in a slow cooker using the warm setting.\n\nRecipe Variations\n-----------------\n\n*   **Extra Rich and Creamy:** Instead of milk, use half and half or heavy cream for richer mashed potatoes.\n*   **Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes:** Substitute buttermilk for the milk. Do not warm the buttermilk or it may curdle. You’ll love the tangy buttermilk flavor!\n*   **Cream Cheese:** Add 4 ounces of cream cheese per 3 pounds of potatoes. Soften the cream cheese to room temperature and then mash it into the potatoes along with the butter.\n*   **Sour Cream:** Add 2 tablespoons of sour cream, plus more to taste if desired. Sour cream makes the potatoes extra creamy and adds a slightly tangy flavor.\n*   **Garlic Mashed Potatoes:** For easy garlic mashed potatoes, stir in garlic powder, starting with 1/4 teaspoon and then adding more to taste or try my [garlic mashed potatoes](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/garlic-mashed-potatoes/) recipe with [roasted garlic](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/roasted-garlic/). \n*   **Herb Mashed Potatoes:** Chives are a classic addition to mashed potatoes. Or, add other fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme or sage. If you want to add dried herbs, oregano, thyme and basil are good options.\n*   **Bacon:** Because everything is better with bacon! Cook chopped bacon in a skillet and then top mashed potatoes with the cooked bacon crumbles.\n*   **Loaded Mashed Potatoes:** The ultimate comfort food!

These meatballs are tender to the core! Nestled in a rich and creamy lemon sauce, they are perfect to serve over pasta, quinoa, or fluffy rice!\n\n![greek chicken meatballs in lemon cream sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-12-710x1065.jpg)\n\nWarm, hearty and deliciously creamy!\n\nThese tender, seared chicken meatballs are rolling around in a creamy lemon sauce that has a nice little zing! They’re warm and comforting but still offer a bright and beautiful lemony flavor that doesn’t leave you feeling heavy. Don’t be surprised if you catch the fam eating right out of the skillet while the sauce is still warm and tangy.\n\nIt’s the perfect transitional meal to take us from summer right into fall or from winter into spring. I’m not quite ready to let go of all the summer flavors, but with the gloomy weather we’ve been having lately, I’m ready for warm bowls of food again. Greek chicken meatballs totally fit the bill.\n\n![chicken meatballs in lemon sauce with cooked orzo in speckled bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**What do you need to make the Greek chicken meatballs?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Garlic + herbs:** minced garlic, chopped parsley, and dried oregano help add flavor the meatballs. You can use fresh or dried herbs for this recipe. Keep in mind you need roughly double the amount if you’re using fresh herbs.\n*   **Lemon zest:** brightens up the meatballs and adds just a fresh flavor to them\n*   **breadcrumbs:** are used for binding. I prefer to use [Panko](https://amzn.to/31UtFlz) breadcrumbs because they melt right into the meatballs and you don’t even realize they’re there.\n*   **Feta cheese:** adds tang and aids in binding the meatballs as well. Before this recipe, I had never added feta cheese to homemade meatballs, and I love the flavor they add.\n*   **An egg:** Acts as a binder to hold everything together.\n*   **Ground chicken:** I prefer to use ground chicken breasts, but I would think if you like chicken thighs, you might want to use ground thighs here. They would certainly add more flavor and retain extra moisture as well!\n\n![ingredients for the meatball ball mixture in stainless steel bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-17-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### **How to portion chicken meatballs:**\n\nOnce you’ve made the meatball mixture, divide it into 24-28 portions. I like to use a [cookie scoop](https://amzn.to/3jSfROH) so that the meatballs are all the same size. Doing this also cuts down on the guesswork for cooking the meatballs because they cook up in roughly the same amount of time when they’re the same size.\n\n### **What if the meatball mixture sticks to my hands?**\n\nIf the meatball mixture sticks to your hands when you’re rolling them, just spray the inside of your hands with a little cooking spray before grabbing the meat mixture. This should keep the mixture from sticking to your hands!\n\n![close up of cooked chicken meatball in lemon cream sauce on a spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-4-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**How to make Greek chicken meatballs:**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  In a bowl, combine everything but the meat mixture along with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. I use a fork to mix all the ingredients together.\n2.  When the ingredients are mix, add the ground chicken and mix until just combined. You don’t want to overwork the meat mixture or you’ll be left with tough and dry meatballs. Portion the meatballs using a cookie scoop into roughly 1 ½ tablespoon portions. \n3.  Add a drizzle of oil to a hot skillet and cook the meatballs for about 5-7 minutes or until they cook all the way through. You want to flip them so that they brown evenly on all sides. Be sure to not overcrowd the pan or they won’t brown!\n\n> **TIP:** At this point, you can allow the meatballs to cool and freeze them for later. If you plan on making this midweek and don’t have the time to fry the meatballs the day of, just freeze the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment. When frozen, transfer to a freezer-safe bag.\n\n![close up of prepared meatballs in lemon sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients for the lemon sauce for Greek chicken meatballs?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Butter:** Butter plays a two-part role in the sauce. We’ll use a little bit to sauté the garlic and flour in and the last tablespoon is added at the end to add creaminess and a little bit of luster to the sauce.\n*   **Garlic:** sautéed in butter it adds so much delicious flavor to the sauce\n*   **flour:** just a tablespoon is used in this recipe to help thicken the sauce\n*   **Chicken stock:** is the base of the creamy lemon sauce\n*   **Green olives:** briny green olives are the perfect pairing to the bright zingy lemon sauce. Capers would also work if you aren’t a fan of green olives\n*   **Egg yolks:** the egg yolks I know are an unusual addition to a cream sauce. They help emulsify the sauce and make it extra creamy and delicious! Trust me, I was super scared to try it too, but I have a foolproof method for you below!\n*   **Lemon juice + zest:** help flavor the sauce\n*   **Nutmeg:** Add a depth of flavor that works beautifully with all the lemony flavor in this recipe. [Freshly grated](https://amzn.to/2Ds0dtI) works best!\n\n![lemon sauce pouring from spoon oven meatballs in bowl with orzo](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-5-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**The secret to perfectly smooth lemon sauce:**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cook the flour:** Add a knob of butter to the skillet and allow the butter to melt. Saute the garlic in the butter until fragrant. Then, add the flour and whisk. You want to let the flour cook for 30 seconds to get rid of the raw flavor. Then, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Once the stock is completely incorporated, allow it to reach a simmer and then let cook for a few minutes until it thickens just a tad bit.\n2.  **Combine the yolks and lemon juice:** While the sauce is thickening, you want to add the lemon juice to a bowl along with the egg yolks and whisk them to combine. Then, once the sauce is thickened, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet to the lemon egg mixture as you whisk. **Adding the hot liquid to the eggs and lemon juice will help temper the yolks so that the sauce doesn’t break later.** You’ll repeat the same thing a total of three times or until you’ve added a total of 3 tablespoons of the liquid to the yolk mixture.\n3.  **Finish the sauce:** With the skillet on the lowest heat setting, stir the yolk mixture into the skillet. Once combined, kick the heat up to medium and continue to stir and cook the sauce for 4-6 minutes until it thickens to your liking. Keep in mind it will thicken quite a bit when it cools, so you don’t want to thicken it too much at this point if you plan on serving it later! Stir in the lemon zest and the nutmeg. Then, add the butter and green olives to the sauce and stir to combine. Place the meatballs back into the pan and allow them to just heat through. Serve warm over buttered orzo, or with fried bread on the side.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Greek Avgolemono Soup](https://littlespicejar.com/avgolemono-soup/)\n*   [Rustic Chicken Piccata Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/rustic-chicken-piccata-meatballs/)\n*   [French Onion Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/comforting-french-onion-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Cajun Chicken Meatballs in Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/cajun-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Swedish Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/swedish-meatballs/)\n*   [Firecracker Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/firecracker-chicken-meatballs/)\n\n![skillet with meatballs and sauce with wooden spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-7-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![Greek Chicken Meatballs in Lemon Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-735x1102.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Meatballs:\n\n*   5 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon zest AND chopped parsley\n*   ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs\n*   ⅓ cup grated yellow onions\n*   ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   1 large egg\n*   1 ½ teaspoon dried oregano (a little more if it’s fresh)\n*   1 ¼ pound lean ground chicken\n\n#### Lemon Olive Sauce:\n\n*   3 tablespoons salted cold butter, cubed\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n*   1 ½ cups low sodium chicken stock\n*   ½ cup green olives (or use ¼ cup capers!)\n*   2 teaspoons lemon zest + ⅓ cup lemon juice\n*   2 egg yolks\n*   ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **MEATBALLS:** In a medium bowl, using a fork, mix together all the ingredients except the ground chicken. You also want to add 1 teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper. When the ingredients are combined, add the ground chicken and mix until \\*just\\* combined. Just be sure you don’t overwork the meat. Roll into 24-28 meatballs using a cookie scoop or about 1 ½ tablespoon each.\n2.  **COOK:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle in a little oil. Add the meatballs to the skillet but do not overcrowd. Cook in batches if they don’t all fit. Sear the meatballs for 5-7 minutes, flipping to brown all sides evenly, until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. Remove the meatballs to a plate.\n3.  **SAUCE:** Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet along with the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn. Add the flour and whisk. Once the flour cooks for 30 seconds, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Then, allow the sauce to reach a simmer, and continue to cook for 3 minutes or until the sauce thickens a bit. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and let the sauce hang out. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and egg yolks. Once combined, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet into the egg mixture while you whisk it. Repeat this step two more times (so a total of 3 tablespoon of sauce should be added to the yolks.) Then, with the heat on the lowest setting, add the yolk mixture to the sauce you have on the stove. Kick the heat up to medium and stir the sauce and allow it to cook for 4-6 minutes or until it thickens to your liking. Then, stir in the nutmeg and lemon zest. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper as desired. Add the last tablespoon of butter to the sauce and allow it to melt in slowly. Add the green olives to the sauce along with the meatballs. Let them heat through for just a minute or two until warm. Serve with fried bread, over buttered orzo, or rice!\n\nThis site contains affiliate links, if you make a purchase through them, we receive a small commission.\n\n_originally published on_ Sep 3, 2020 _(last updated_ Jul 9, 2022_)_\n\n[54 comments](https://littlespicejar.com/greek-chicken-meatballs-in-lemon-cream-sauce/#comments) [Leave a comment »](#respond)"

The ground pork has a higher fat content than the ground beef which keeps these meatballs perfectly juicy and flavorful.\n\n**Step One:** The first step to making these meatballs is to chop the herbs, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. For ultimate flavor this recipe uses a combination of fresh mint, dill, and parsley as well as red onion and garlic.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8c4b5e6.jpg)\n\n**Step Two:** Once you have chopped everything, now it’s time to make the meatballs. Add the ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, and herbs to a mixing bowl. This is also when you’ll add the dried herbs, spices, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything until well combined.\n\n**Step Three:** When the meat, herbs, and spices are well combined use a cookie dough scoop to form the meatballs and then roll them in between the palm of your hands. Place them on a sheet pan that has been drizzled with olive oil.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8d074cf.jpg)\n\n**Step Four:** After all of the meatballs have been rolled and placed on the sheet pan, bake them at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes until they have cooked all the way through.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8e065f6.jpg)\n\nCool and Creamy Tzatziki Sauce\n------------------------------\n\nThe meatballs are definitely the star of this recipe but the cool and creamy tzatziki sauce deserves an award, too. If you have never had tzatziki before I am incredibly excited for you to try this recipe because, honestly, it just might change your life.

The ground pork has a higher fat content than the ground beef which keeps these meatballs perfectly juicy and flavorful.\n\n**Step One:** The first step to making these meatballs is to chop the herbs, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. For ultimate flavor this recipe uses a combination of fresh mint, dill, and parsley as well as red onion and garlic.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8c4b5e6.jpg)\n\n**Step Two:** Once you have chopped everything, now it’s time to make the meatballs. Add the ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, and herbs to a mixing bowl. This is also when you’ll add the dried herbs, spices, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything until well combined.\n\n**Step Three:** When the meat, herbs, and spices are well combined use a cookie dough scoop to form the meatballs and then roll them in between the palm of your hands. Place them on a sheet pan that has been drizzled with olive oil.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8d074cf.jpg)\n\n**Step Four:** After all of the meatballs have been rolled and placed on the sheet pan, bake them at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes until they have cooked all the way through.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8e065f6.jpg)\n\nCool and Creamy Tzatziki Sauce\n------------------------------\n\nThe meatballs are definitely the star of this recipe but the cool and creamy tzatziki sauce deserves an award, too.

It is just a wonderfully seasoned dish of roasted deliciousness. The veggies tend to break down into a stew-like consistency, but there isn’t enough “broth/gravy” to consider it a stew.\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Vegetable Bake](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rustic-Italian-Vegetable-Bake_11.jpg)\n\n**Helpful Tips**\n----------------\n\nThe key thing to ensure a perfectly baked dish is to make sure all the potatoes are perfectly tender.  You need to test several of them by piercing them with a sharp knife.\n\nAdditionally, try not to mix them with a heavy hand. You don’t want the veggies to break down too much, but if they do, no worries. It still tastes AH-MAZING!!!\n\nI’ll let Mom tell you more!\n\n![Rustic Italian Vegetable Bake](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rustic-Italian-Vegetable-Bake_17.jpg)\n\n**Hi!  Robin here.**\n--------------------\n\nWhat I love about this dish is that it is super-duper easy to make.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.\n2.  Place the **Spice/Herb Ingredients** into a small bowl, mix to combine, set aside.\n3.  Place all the **Bake Ingredients** and **Spice/Herb mix** into a deep ceramic/enamel lined Dutch oven or similar roasting pan. Mix well everything to ensure all the ingredients are evenly coated.  Sprinkle the top lightly with some additional sea salt and black pepper.  Cover with a tight-fitting lid, then place in a preheated 400 F oven and roast for 40 minutes.\n4.  After 40 minutes, remove from the oven and gently mix in the cannellini beans, cover and return to the oven for another 5 to 20 minutes **or until the potatoes are perfectly tender**. The 2nd baking time is largely dependent upon the size of the potatoes. (see notes on baking time).\n5.  After 5 minutes (or 20 minutes), remove from the oven, remove the lid and allow the heat to escape for approx. 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.\n6.  Sprinkle individual portions with nutritional yeast (or [**_Vegan Parmesan Cheese_**](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/vegan-parmesan-cheese/)) and serve with some freshly chopped parsley.\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n**\\*Vegetable Stock:**   We use **_Pacific Organic Low Sodium Vegetable Stock_**. We love this brand because it is Whole Food Plant Based compliant, as it does not contain MSG, has no oil, and does not contain any highly-processed ingredients.\n\n**\\*Stock Amount:** The amount of vegetable stock is a personal preference.  This is not a stew, so there is little broth, but the veggies are coated in a nice thin-like rustic gravy.  If you want more “gravy”, use 4 tablespoons of vegetable stock.\n\n**\\*Baking Soda:**  The baking soda is often used as a neutralizer for dishes that contain a lot of acidity, typically from tomatoes.  We use it in this dish to remove some of the tomato acidity without losing the tomatoey flavor. When you add it, the mixture will bubble up, then settle down as it neutralizes the acidity.\n\n**\\*Dried Thyme Crushed Leaves:**  We use **_[Penzeys French Thyme](https://amzn.to/31Ud5iK)_**.  It has amazing flavor.  If you can’t find dried crushed thyme leaves, you can use ground thyme, but use half the amount.\n\n**\\*Zucchini Texture:**  Because the zucchini is in the oven for a long period of time, it will be mushy. This is a rustic bake, so this is expected. However, we know there may be folks who prefer a firmer texture. Please feel free to add the zucchini later in the oven baking process if you do not enjoy mushy zucchini.\n\n**\\*Potato Wedges:**  Potato wedges take longer to cook than cubed potatoes.  If you are looking to shorten the oven time, then cube the potatoes.  When checking for tenderness of the potatoes, be sure to check multiple potatoes as the ones that are on the bottom tend to cook faster than the ones on top.  Avoid constantly stirring the mixture as this will cause the vegetables to break down.  Gently stir, if needed to rotate the potatoes.\n\n**\\*Baking Time:**  We highly recommend using a ceramic/enamel lined Dutch oven with a tightly fitting lid as it intensifies the heat and conducts heat better.  Whenever you are cooking potatoes with tomatoes, the acid from the tomatoes toughens the potatoes’ cellular wall and makes it harder for liquids to penetrate and soften the potatoes.  In other words, it will take longer in the oven for the potatoes than one might traditionally think.  We have had Readers tell us that when they **don’t use** a Dutch oven that it has taken up to 75 to 90 minutes for their potatoes to soften.  Additionally, constantly opening the oven door loses temperature in the oven adding additional time for the potatoes to soften.\n\n**\\*Sea Salt:**  Please adjust the sea salt based upon your family’s sea salt preferences and/or based upon dietary needs.\n\n**\\*Serving:**  Makes 4-5 servings.\n\n**\\*Storage:**  Refrigerate and use within 5 days.\n\n![](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AmeeraRobinSignoff.png)\n\n_This post contains affiliate links, and we may receive a very small commission if you purchase through those links at no additional cost to you.

This girl!\n\nOf course it took posting a photo of this plate-o-yum on IG to give me the push I needed. I have some very awesome friends with some very impatient squash (_squashes? squashi? I think I’m overthinking this!_) awaiting this recipe. I had to deliver!\n\nWithout further ado, here’s my  all-time favorite butternut squash recipe. Hands-down. No question.\n\nThis savory sweet side dish is perfect for the holidays and you should totally make it right now!\n\nWell, make it now, and then make it AGAIN for the holidays.\n\nAll of them.\n\n_Duh._\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta One Pan Sheet Pan Recipe](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-0208.jpg)\n\nso . . . how is it?!\n--------------------\n\nDelightfully delicious! The combination of sweetness from the butternut squash and honey paired perfectly with the tart and juicy cranberries is a thing of beauty!\n\nThe dish is super customizable too, so feel free to make it as sweet or sassy as you’d like. The feta adds a delightful twist, and can easily be swapped for an uber creamy goat cheese as well. I hope you love this tasty holiday side dish as much as we do! It’s become a staple in our house and I have a feeling it will be for years to come!\n\nThis simple side can be whipped up with just a few fresh ingredients and is loaded with Fall flavor.\n\nAs an added bonus, as the butternut squash roasts away it fills the house with the most delicious aromas. I had to hold myself back from climbing in the oven with it after the twenty minute mark. It was a little less Sylvia Plath and a little more was more “_LET ME AT THAT SQUASH!_” I may have stolen a few cubes to munch on when I added the cranberries. _So good!_\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta - This sweet and savory side dish is perfect for the holidays and loaded with Fall flavor!](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-feta-recipe-thanksgiving-0245-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 3 lb large butternut squash (peeled + chopped)\n*   ▢ 1-2 TBSP [extra virgin olive oil](https://amzn.to/2QvhPq6)\n*   ▢ salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste\n*   ▢ 1-2 cups fresh cranberries (add a little, or a lot!)\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP honey plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ ¼ cup finely crumbled feta\n*   ▢ ground cinnamon to taste \n*   ▢ fresh or dried parsley to garnish, optional\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F.\n    \n*   Lightly drizzle or spritz a baking sheet with olive oil.\n    \n*   Add cubed squash to the sheet along with another drizzle of olive oil.\n    \n*   Sprinkle with a light layer of salt, pepper, and garlic powder, based on taste preference.\n    \n*   Roast at 400 F for 25 minutes on the center rack.\n    \n*   At the 25 minute mark, pull out the oven rack, and add your fresh cranberries to the roasting pan.\n    \n*   Return to the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cranberries have started to soften and burst a bit, resembling really juicy craisins vs fresh firm cranberries.\n    \n*   Remove from oven and add a sprinkle of cinnamon (approx. 1/8-1/4 tsp depending on preference) along with feta and honey. I listed the honey measurements I used, but depending on whether you used fresh cranberries or dried, sweeten to taste.\n    \n*   Garnish with parsley for a burst of color and dig in while it's hot!\n    \n\nFeel free to use fresh or dried cranberries for this dish.\n\nDried will be sweeter, while fresh with have a delightful punch of tartness to pair with the buttery squash and sweet honey.

I still bake with it because it’s an awesome natural sweetener and I adore it so, but if I have the option to keep it as close to raw as possible, I do. Hence adding the honey after roasting the squash and cranberries in this recipe. The fruit and veggie medley is still just warm enough to allow the honey to cover the dish as a deliciously sweet glaze, but not so scorching that it’s spending 30+ minutes in my oven losing all it’s fabulous benefits.\n\n_File this under things I tell myself so I can eat more honey._\n\nIf you’re as squash obsessed as I am right now, you should totally take your Fall/Winter menu up a few notches and try my [Cheesy Garlic Parmesan Spaghetti Squash](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/09/cheesy-garlic-parmesan-spinach-spaghetti-squash.html) and Butternut Cauliflower Soup.\n\nSO DELICIOUS!\n\nIf you get a chance to try this Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta, let me know!\n\nYou can leave me a comment here (LOVE checking those daily!) or tag @PEASandCRAYONS #PEASANDCRAYONS on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peasandcrayons) so I can happy dance over your creations!

I’ve done some experimenting and here’s what I’ve got so far!\n\nI’ve found the best advance-prep results were when I pre-roasted the squash for around 25-30 minutes and then before serving, I tossed the room temperature squash back in the oven along with the cranberries for an additional 10 minutes or so until the cranberries started to burst and the squash crisped back up around the edges (yet still creamy and buttery on the inside!). I reheated it in the oven just before serving so the feta and honey were added to the still-warm dish and it worked great!\n\nI have also cooked the squash and berries in their entirety and popped them in the fridge. I let it come to room temp for a bit then reheated them in the oven for around 10 minutes before serving, adding the cheese/honey after as well. The first method had more of the texture I was looking for but the results from this method were still good!\n\nLet me know if you find another method that works great for you as well!\n\nLast year I even slapped the leftover honey roasted butternut squash with cranberries on an epic Thanksgiving leftover sandwich (with all the fixings) and it was amazing!\n\nPeas and Crayons is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites at no cost to readers.\n\n[![Jenn Laughlin Headshot Photo - About the Author](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jenn-laughlin-headshot-peasandcrayons--scaled-e1716318471546-600x600.jpg)](https://peasandcrayons.com/about)\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nJenn Laughlin\n-------------\n\nJenn Laughlin created Peas and Crayons in 2009 after graduating with B.S. in Dietetics from Florida State University while working as a Nutrition Educator for WIC.

We ate leftovers for every meal on Friday, switched it up with [tacos](https://www.thekitchn.com/beef-taco-recipe-23020688) on Saturday, and ordered [pizza](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-really-good-pizza-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-178384) on Sunday because we still didn’t feel like cooking. The next few days for lunch will probably be more leftovers, because I can’t see beyond the mountain of plastic-wrapped [mashed potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-180434) and [stuffing](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-the-very-best-thanksgiving-stuffing-237564) in the fridge to even try and dig for a fresh vegetable.\n\nWhen I do break free and get back to some type of normalcy, I know exactly what I’ll be eating to help me reset.

Everything roasts together in the oven: big cubes of [sweet potato](https://www.thekitchn.com/roasted-sweet-potatoes-263158), crunchy pepitas, and even oversized crumbles of feta, which take on this wonderful chewy-creamy texture when warmed. Instead of sautéing the [cauliflower rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice-couscous-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203344) (buy it pre-riced to save time), you’ll also throw it into the oven. Tossing it with [turmeric](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipes-with-turmeric-223795) gives it a gorgeous golden hue and a slightly earthy flavor.\n\nWhile everything’s roasting, you’ll mix up a fresh bean salad: a [can of chickpeas](https://www.thekitchn.com/chickpea-recipes-234833), a handful of [herbs](https://www.thekitchn.com/your-guide-to-storing-fresh-herbs-in-the-fridge-231412), a drizzle of [olive oil](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-olive-oil-and-extra-virgin-olive-oil-word-of-mouth-218767), and a squeeze of [lime juice](https://www.thekitchn.com/5-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-juice-from-limes-amp-lemons-tips-from-the-kitchn-119886). Pile onto the [roasted veg](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221), then enjoy for lunch right after it’s made or divvy into lunch containers and eat throughout the week. You don’t even need to futz with a dressing — just drizzle with more oil and a squeeze a lime juice before diving in.\n\nThe flexibility of this recipe makes it extra budget-friendly. Use whatever root vegetable you have on hand or is on sale at the grocery store. Buy pepitas in the bulk section, or swap out another nut or seed that’s already stashed in your pantry. It’s delicious any way you make it.\n\n[Comments](#comments-263225)\n\nAn easy, protein-packed vegetarian lunch bowl made with cauliflower rice, sweet potatoes, and a vibrant chickpea salad.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    root vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, or a combination, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes\n    \n*   4 tablespoons\n    \n    olive oil, divided, plus more for serving\n    \n*   1 1/2 teaspoons\n    \n    kosher salt, divided\n    \n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n    \n*   4 ounces\n    \n    feta cheese, drained\n    \n*   1/4 cup\n    \n    pumpkin seeds\n    \n*   3 cups\n    \n    fresh or frozen cauliflower rice, such as Trader Joe's\n    \n*   1/2 teaspoon\n    \n    ground turmeric\n    \n*   1 (15.5-ounce) can\n    \n    chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1/2 cup\n    \n    coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems\n    \n*   Finely grated zest of 2 medium limes\n    \n*   Juice of 2 medium limes, plus more wedges for serving\n    \n*   1\n    \n    medium avocado, pitted and quartered\n    \n\n1.  Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to 425°F. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, then season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and several grinds of black pepper. Toss to combine, then arrange into an even layer. Roast on the lower rack until beginning to brown, about 20 minutes.\n    \n2.  Flip the sweet potatoes and push them to one side. Add the pumpkin seeds to the now-empty portion of the baking sheet and crumble the feta into large pieces over the sweet potatoes. Place the cauliflower rice (if using frozen, break up any clumps first), turmeric, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and several grinds of black pepper on a second rimmed baking sheet and toss until evenly combined. Spread into an even layer.\n    \n3.  Place the sweet potatoes on the upper rack and the cauliflower rice on the lower rack. Roast until the pumpkin seeds are toasted, the sweet potatoes are golden-brown, and the feta is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl and toss until evenly coated; set aside.\n    \n4.  **For each serving:** Transfer 1/4 of the rice, 1/4 of the sweet potato and feta mixture, and 1/4 of the chickpea mixture into a bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the pepitas and top with a piece of the avocado (peel the avocado if eating immediately). Drizzle with more olive oil and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve with a lime wedge.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Storage:** Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."

Using a meat mallet or the bottom of your fry pan, pound breasts to even thickness (you don't want the meat super-flat, just even in thickness). Place the prepared chicken in a large sealable plastic bag and set aside.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon lime zest, 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, minced garlic, honey, cumin, coriander, and salt and pepper (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of each; add to your preference). Once the mixture is well combined, remove 3 tablespoons of the mixture and reserve for later.\n    \n*   Add the rest of the marinade to the bag with the chicken. Seal the bag and then knead with your hands to ensure all of the chicken is well coated. Place in the fridge and marinate for at least 30 minutes and preferably 2-3 hours. Don't marinate longer than 6 hours. (Acid from lime begins to \"cook\" the chicken.)\n    \n*   Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (about 400 degrees F.). Generously oil the grill (I drench a roll-up paper towel in vegetable oil and, holding it with tongs, rub it over the grill grates. Don't skip this step.) Start by grilling the pineapple **(See Note 1)** so you can work on the salsa while the chicken cooks. Rub about 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil over all sides of the pineapple. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.\n    \n*   Remove chicken from marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.\n    \n*   While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.\n    \n*   We like to serve Pineapple Chicken with coconut rice or cilantro-lime rice. If you'd like those recipes, check for the links to those recipes right above this recipe card!\n    \n\n**Note** **1**: You don't have to grill the pineapple, but it does add an amazing sweetness (it caramelizes as it grills) to the dish. Check pictures in the post for the size of pineapple to grill. (I cut the cored and peeled the pineapple and cut into about 9 or 10 long strips.) Once grilled, I slice each pineapple strip in 3 long strips and then dice those long strips into small pieces for the salsa. Use a sharp knife here! You will likely have more pineapple salsa than needed to top chicken, but we like a lot--or finish the rest off with chips. You can halve the pineapple salsa recipe, but I like it as written, so I don't waste the rest of the veggies.\n\n**Note 2**: A good, ripe avocado adds a delicious creamy element to this dish. If you don't add avocado and want a creamy element, I'd recommend the [jalapeno sauce from this recipe](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/jamaican-jerk-tacos/).

Sorry to shout, but they’re so good, and they’re super easy and quick to make on the stovetop in less than ten minutes. No fuss, no oven. And you may want to make a double batch, because it’s hard to stop snacking on them. I ate a lot of mine before the salad even got dressed!\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8777/28089678120_7875bc7005_o.jpg)\n\nIn other news, I have a serious peach problem. Last summer, we got down to Chattanooga at the end of peach session, right after [**The Peach Truck**](https://thepeachtruck.com/) had left town. I was so mad I had missed out. All year I waited and checked the schedule. And when they came to East Ridge a little over a week ago, I was there. I bought a [**25-pound box of peaches**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHnJEUdjlqw/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk) and a one-pound bag of pecans.\n\nSince then, it’s been all peaches all the time. In addition to eating an embarrassing number of them out of hand, juice dripping everywhere, I’ve made a [**peach dutch baby**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHuI8GPjCl0/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk), [**peach margaritas**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH0nlumjGdT/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk) (I shared the full recipe [**on Insta**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH0nlumjGdT/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk)–they’re so good!), peach muffins, and peach ice cream.\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8834/27756526903_ab5be3a9af_o.jpg)\n\nI have a few more peaches stashed in the fridge, and finally got around to a savory application: this summer kale salad. It’s pretty much an all-local salad because the kale is from my [**Big Sycamore Farm**](http://www.bigsycamorefarm.com/) CSA and the peaches and pecans are from Georgia (I live in TN but I’m just a few minutes from the GA border).\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8845/27756526603_e2a4a990ff_o.jpg)\n\nI picked the blueberries this weekend up at my friend [**Lindsey**](https://lindseylowephoto.wordpress.com/)‘s family’s place on [**Lookout Mountain**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH8aiM0DGBp/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk), and they gave me this amazing goat cheese they made themselves with milk from their own goats. I’m pretty sure I live in the best, most delicious place on earth!\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8608/28376099415_ab92db2430_o.jpg)\n\nThis summer kale salad is so easy and so fast, and you’ll feel a wonderfully healthy glow after eating it. Happy summer!  \n\nInstructions\n------------\n\n1.  To make the candied pecans, heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the pecan halves, maple syrup, smoked paprika, and a couple of pinches of sea salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until the pecans are coated in a sticky glaze and no liquid remains in the pan, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pecans to a parchment-lined plate and spread them out in a single layer to cool.\n2.  Mix all the dressing ingredients with a fork in a large bowl. Add the kale leaves, toss to coat them with the dressing, and massage them by hand until reduced in volume, darker green, and tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the kale to a platter or divide it between individual serving plates. Top with the peach slices, blueberries, crumbled goat cheese, and candied pecans.\n\n###### Nutrition Information:\n\nYield: 4 Serving Size: 1 small serving  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 372Total Fat: 31gSaturated Fat: 7gTrans Fat: 0gUnsaturated Fat: 23gCholesterol: 14mgSodium: 127mgCarbohydrates: 21gFiber: 6gSugar: 10gProtein: 8g\n\n_The nutrition label provided is an estimate for informational purposes only and may not be accurate.

    "markdown": "# Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce. - Half Baked Harvest\nThis post may contain affiliate links, please see our [privacy policy](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/privacy-policy/) for details.\n\nBringing you all some springtime vibes with these Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce. Grilled Greek chicken (or roasted), served bowl style with orzo, roasted peppers, avocado, feta cheese, cucumbers, and the most deliciously addicting sizzled mint goddess sauce. It doesn’t get easier or more delicious than this grilled chicken…simple, quick, extra colorful, super flavorful, and so delicious. The perfect dinner to serve any night of the week!\n\n![overhead photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and olive on table](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-1-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nBasically I am full on ready for summer, and this recipe proves it. I know it’s only mid April, but in my defense, I feel like most everyone (in the US at least) is slowly beginning to experience warmer days that are fit for grilling. Are you? My fingers are crossed that you are, but if not, don’t worry, you can easily roast this chicken too!\n\nEither way, this is the perfect recipe for Monday. It also feels very April appropriate – healthy, colorful, and delicious! All very important things.\n\nWith Easter this Sunday, I have Greek food on my mind. Something about Easter always inspires me to create recipes with a Greek influence. I say influence because I know that my recipes may not be traditional, but this is my personal spin on a more traditional recipe.\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5032-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5052-700x1050.jpg)\n\nLast year I even made my first [spanakopita](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-spinach-and-feta-pie-spanakopita/ \"Greek Spinach and Feta Pie (Spanakopita).\") (Greek spinach and feta pie), along with these [Greek orzo stuffed peppers](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-orzo-stuffed-red-peppers/ \"Greek Orzo Stuffed Red Peppers with Lemony Basil Tomatoes.\")! Both of which are some of my favorite spring and summer recipes. And then there’s these [Greek lamb meatballs](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-lamb-meatballs-with-avocado-goddess-sauce/ \"Greek Lamb Meatballs with Avocado Goddess Sauce.\"), which so many of you have made and seem to have loved. Those meatballs inspired this recipe. Ever since I made those meatballs a year ago, I have been obsessed with the recipe. I make it every chance I get, which honestly is not often enough, as I’m consistently testing new recipes.\n\nPoint is, I love the flavors so very much, but more often than not I end up having chicken on hand opposed to ground lamb. Soo, enter the chicken version of these bowls. But made in a very different way, because well, I never seem to make the same recipe twice. Both bowls are SO GOOD, but right now I am all about this Greek chicken.\n\nAnd it feels kind of fitting for Easter, doesn’t it?\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5054-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5065-700x1050.jpg)\n\nI marinate the chicken in quite possibly one of my favorite marinades. It’s a combination of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika (which is not really “Greek”…but it’s good), fresh oregano, shallots (the secret!), garlic, and lots of lemon (always so much lemon). Now, when I say marinate, I really just mean toss the chicken in this mix and let it sit while you get everything else for the bowls together. I’m not sure about you guys, but I can never plan ahead enough to cook a recipe requiring a long marinate time.\n\nIt almost never happens…\n\nSo, I do a quick marinade. It works.\n\n![close up photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-2-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nWhile the chicken is “marinating”, make the sizzled mint goddess sauce.\n\nHere’s the truth, I really do not love mint. I find it overpowers most recipe. Unless it’s a [cocktail](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/category/recipes/drinks/), in which case I think mint is perfect, did you see these [mojitos](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/white-tea-and-muddled-basil-mojito/ \"White Tea and Muddled Basil Mojito.\")? Mint used in savory dishes however, well it throws me off. Until today. Cooking mint in olive oil really mellows out the flavor and makes the mint much less pungent. I found it to be perfect when stirred into a yogurt based goddess sauce. Which I am now spooning over everything, so addicting. Roasted salmon and potatoes are especially delicious.\n\nOnce the sauce is made and the chicken is grilled, it’s assembly time! I used orzo pasta as my grain, but feel free to use quinoa, couscous, or brown rice. Any would be great.\n\nI then layered in some roasted red peppers, avocado, cucumbers, olives, and even some arugula. Lots of veggies… and a good amount of feta cheese too.\n\nSuper pretty, on the (very) healthy side, and so very delicious.\n\n![side angled photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and fork in bowl ](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-4-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nThe added bonus about this recipe is that it’s so great for weekday meal prep. I recommend making this on a Sunday or Monday night and doubling the recipe. Then simply use the leftovers to make lunch or dinner bowls to enjoy throughout the week!\n\nCook everything at once…get multiple meals…love that!\n\nSo excited to be sharing this recipe with you guys. It’s one of those dishes I just know you will love!\n\n![overhead close up photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce ](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-3-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nIf you make these Greek lemon chicken bowls, be sure to leave a comment and/or give this recipe a rating!

You can also make ribbons with a peeler.\n*   **Avocado**: the riper, the better! We sliced them in this salad, but you can also dice them to distribute them better.\n*   **Feta**: Any kind will work in this recipe! You can also use vegan feta to keep this recipe dairy free.\n*   **Hazelnuts**: chopped, toasted or un-toasted.\n\n### For the lime mint vinaigrette:\n\n*   **Olive oil:** Extra virgin will have the best flavor.\n*   **Lime juice:** be sure to use freshly squeezed.\n*   **Mint:** We used fresh, not dried mint in this recipe.\n*   **Salt and pepper:** Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper for seasoniong.\n*   **Sweetener**: you can use maple syrup, agave, or honey.\n\n![close up view of blackberry avocado arugula salad on a white platter](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-8.jpg)\n\nHow to make this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's so easy, you don't even really need instructions, but here they are:\n\n**STEP 1**: Whisk together all the ingredients for the vinaigrette.\n\n**STEP 2**: Add all of the ingredients to a bowl, pour vinaigrette over, and toss. Enjoy!\n\nSubstitutions and Variations\n----------------------------\n\n**Arugula:** Feel free to substitute with spinach, baby kale, or another leafy green.\n\n**Blackberries and blueberries** can be swapped with strawberries, raspberries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, or just about any other summer fruit.\n\n**Not a fan of hazelnuts?** Try swapping with pine nuts, pistachios or pecans.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad in blue bowl](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-13.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**To turn this blackberry avocado arugula salad into a meal**: add a protein and/or grain. Cooked quinoa or wild rice both make fantastic additions.\n\nI also love adding white beans for a bit of extra plant-based protein. I let them marinade in a few tablespoons of the vinaigrette to soak up extra flavor. You could also top with grilled tofu, or chicken, shrimp or steak.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad in blue bowl](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-10.jpg)\n\nStorage\n-------\n\nYou can make this salad and the dressing ahead of time, just make sure to keep them separate if you are storing for longer than a day or two, or else the salad will be too soggy.\n\nOnce dressed, this salad can be kept in an airtight container but should be eaten the next day.\n\nTips and FAQ\n------------\n\nTop tip\n-------\n\nCutting everything into similarly-sized pieces will make this salad easier to toss, and easier to eat.\n\n**Can I use gorgonzola instead of feta?  \n**\n\nAbsolutely! Since not everyone is used to eating feta, gorgonzola or tiny mozzarella balls can be substituted in.\n\nMore summer salad recipes\n-------------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad with Pomegranate and Candied Pecans\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprout-salad-2/)\n*   [\n    \n    Citrus Burrata Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/citrus-burrata-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    White Bean Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/white-bean-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Greek Chickpea Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/greek-chickpea-salad/)\n\n### **Tried this recipe?**\n\n**Please leave a star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating below** and/or a review in the comments section further down the page.

Add the jumbo pasta shells and cook until they're al dente, which means they should still have a slight bite to them. This is crucial as they'll continue cooking in the oven. Once done, drain and set aside.\n2.  **Prepare the Filling**: In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, whisked egg, finely chopped herbs, and seasoning. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated.\n3.  **Saute the Spinach**: In a skillet, heat a bit of olive oil. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add fresh spinach leaves and cook until they're wilted. Once cooled, chop and mix into the cheese mixture. **_\\*QUICK TIP: You can use frozen spinach that's been thawed and had the excess moisture squeezed out._**\n\n![Spinach and ricotta filling for shells.](https://saltedmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ricotta-Stuffed-Shells-2-2.jpg)\n\n1.  **Assemble**: Spread a layer of marinara sauce (or this [roasted red pepper sauce](https://saltedmint.com/really-useful-roasted-red-pepper-sauce/)) at the bottom of a baking dish to prevent sticking. Carefully stuff each pasta shell with the cheese and spinach mixture, ensuring not to overfill. Place them seam-side up in the dish.\n2.  **Bake**: Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the stuffed shells. For an extra cheesy top, sprinkle additional mozzarella and some parmesan over the top. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the top is bubbly and golden.\n\n💡 Top Tips\n-----------\n\n1.  Using a pastry bag or a zip-lock bag with a corner cut-off can make stuffing the shells easier and neater.\n2.  For a spicier kick, add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the marinara sauce or into the cheese mixture.\n3.  Garnish with fresh basil or parsley before serving for added freshness and color.\n\nSlow Cooker Method\n------------------\n\n*   **Preparation**: Before using the slow cooker, ensure you've boiled or soaked the pasta shells as mentioned above. This step is crucial as the slow cooker won't cook the pasta the same way an oven would.\n*   **Layering**: Start by spreading a layer of marinara sauce at the bottom of the slow cooker. This not only adds flavor but also prevents the shells from sticking. Next, place the stuffed shells seam-side up. Once all shells are placed, pour over the remaining marinara sauce ensuring all shells are covered.\n*   **Cooking**: Cover the slow cooker with its lid. Set it on low and let it cook for 5-7 hours. The slow, consistent heat will ensure the flavors meld beautifully.\n\n💡 Top Tips\n-----------\n\n1.  If you're short on time, you can set the slow cooker on high and cook for 3-4 hours, but the low and slow method is recommended for best results.\n2.  About 30 minutes before serving, sprinkle additional mozzarella on top for a melty, cheesy finish.\n3.  For those who love a meaty flavor, consider adding cooked ground beef or Italian sausage to the marinara sauce.\n\n🍯 Storage\n----------\n\n*   **Fridge:** Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3-5 days. \n*   **Freezer:** Freeze in a single layer on a baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag. Can be stored for up to 3 months. \n*   **Reheat:** In the oven at 350°F until heated through.\n\n❓FAQ\n----\n\n**Can I make this dish ahead of time?**\n\nAbsolutely! You can prepare the stuffed shells, refrigerate them, and bake just before serving.  \n\n**What can I serve with ricotta stuffed shells?**\n\nA simple green salad, garlic bread, or roasted vegetables pair beautifully.  \n\n**Can I use other types of cheese besides ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan?**\n\nYes, you can experiment with other cheeses. Fontina or provolone can be a good substitute for mozzarella, and cottage cheese can sometimes be used in place of ricotta, though the texture will be slightly different.  \n\n**I'm gluten-free. Can I use gluten-free pasta shells for this recipe?**\n\nAbsolutely! There are many gluten-free jumbo pasta shell options available in stores. Just ensure you follow the cooking instructions on the package, as gluten-free pasta can have a different cooking time and texture.  \n\n**How can I make this dish vegan?**\n\nTo make vegan stuffed shells, replace the cheeses with vegan alternatives available in most grocery stores. Instead of an egg, you can use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 2.5 tablespoons water) as a binder.  \n\n**Can I add meat to this dish?**\n\nYes, ground beef, Italian sausage, or even ground turkey can be cooked and mixed into the marinara sauce or combined with the cheese filling for a meaty variation.  \n\nLooking for other recipes like this?

Although, if it is, you’ll be pleasantly surprised how delicious they are when prepared this way.\n\nA basic roasting method for potatoes is to cut them into a large dice, toss them together with olive oil, salt and pepper and roast them in the oven at around 400-425° F.\n\nIf you’re looking for an even easier way to do it and one with extra flavor, then I highly suggest giving this parmesan pesto version a try.\n\nTo make this recipe as easy as possible I used a bag of tricolored baby potatoes. The bags of potatoes generally include red, white and yellow potatoes.\n\nSometimes purple ones are included as well, like the bag I used. The potatoes have thin skin, which is perfect for roasting because the skin will crisp quickly. \n\n[![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes on gray plate with small bowl of pesto.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Picture-680x978.jpg)](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Picture.jpg)\n\n**Can I Use a Different Variety of Potato?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that bags of tricolored baby potatoes aren’t the most economical. If you aren’t interested in the having the different colors or don’t mind doing a little more prep, you can definitely substitute them.\n\nI recommend substituting with Yukon Gold or red potatoes. They have thin skins and a creamier flesh, which will give you a great roasted potato.\n\nWhether your doing the dicing on your own or using a bag of baby potatoes, it’s important that they’re as close to the same size as possible. This will ensure they are all cooked properly and you don’t wind up with some that are mushy and others that are still raw. \n\n**How to Prep Potatoes for Roasting**\n-------------------------------------\n\nPrepping the potatoes for roasting is beyond easy and should only take about 5 minutes assuming you’re using potatoes. If you aren’t it will probably take 10 minutes, which is still nothing when it comes to prep time.\n\n1.  Rinse the potatoes under cold water and scrub off any dirt. \n2.  If using baby potatoes cut the larger ones in half so the potatoes are approximately all the same size.\n3.  Spray a rimmed sheet pan with cooking spray. The pan can be lined with foil if you want less cleanup. Lay the potatoes out on the prepared pan, spoon the pesto onto the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Toss everything together with your hands until all of the potatoes are coated in the pesto.\n4.  Grate the parmesan cheese, but don’t add it to the potatoes at this point. It will be added to them during the last 2 minutes of roasting.\n\nAside from the pesto and parmesan cheese, there’s one more magical ingredients that’s not to be skipped. Fresh squeezed lemon juice. The lemon juice gets squeezed over the potatoes after they’ve finished roasting in the oven.\n\nIt adds a wonderful bright, fresh flavor that goes perfect with the pesto and parmesan. I did the same pesto lemon combination in this popular [**Grilled Chicken and Asparagus Pesto Pasta**](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-chicken-asparagus-pesto-pasta/) and it’s wonderful! \n\n[![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes drizzled with pesto on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Pic-680x1010.jpg)](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Parmesan-Pesto-Roasted-Potatoes-Pic.jpg)\n\n**What To Serve With Pesto Potatoes?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**More Potato Recipes**\n-----------------------\n\n*   [Chimichurri Potato Salad](https://reciperunner.com/chimichurri-potato-salad/)\n*   [Skinny Cheesy Potato Casserole](https://reciperunner.com/skinny-cheesy-potato-casserole/)\n*   [Cheesy Chipotle Lime Twice Baked Sweet Potatoes](https://reciperunner.com/cheesy-chipotle-lime-twice-baked-sweet-potatoes/)\n*   [Everything Bagel Roasted Potatoes](https://reciperunner.com/everything-bagel-roasted-potatoes/)\n*   [Herb Roasted Potatoes with Blue Cheese](https://reciperunner.com/herb-roasted-potatoes-with-blue-cheese/)\n\n#### **_Did you make these Parmesan Pesto Roasted Potatoes?

On top of that I have already planted a bunch of my container pots which I had to pull indoors. The weather has been nice around here so this little burst of cold has been a real bummer.\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-1.jpg)\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-5.jpg)\n\nWith a chill in the air this past weekend it gave me a chance to catch up on some indoor projects since I’ve been outdoors a lot lately and work on my menu planning for the next couple weeks. Oddly I find menu planning fun. I know some people that dread it but I enjoy it. I’ve got it down to almost to a science although Mr. Mother Thyme thinks I obsess over it a little too much. I love putting together menus with a combination of some of my go-to family favorites along with some new recipes I like to try that I find on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/motherthyme) or in my cookbooks. Some weeks I also have a night or two during the week that are deemed for recipe testing if I have dinner ideas I’ve come up with.\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-13.jpg)\n\nOne of my favorite go-to recipes this is on our dinner menu a lot is Italian sausage with peppers and onions. I usually make it with chopped Italian sausage mixed with tender and juicy peppers and onions. My secret to this delicious recipe is adding a splash of balsamic vinegar at the end and cranking up the heat to really infuse the flavors. It can be served over rice, noodles or I like it alone. It’s so good!\n\nSo I took all the yumminess of that dish and combined it into these amazing peppers that are not only stuffed but roasted too. Yes, roasted! Roasting the peppers make them fork tender to eat and really brings out the sweetness of the peppers. If you love stuffed peppers and never had them roasted it’s almost life changing. You may never want to make stuffed peppers any other way again.\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-2.jpg)\n\n![Roasted Stuffed Peppers with Italian Sausage and Balsamic Glaze | www.motherthyme.com](https://www.motherthyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stuffed-peppers-10.jpg)\n\nAnd if this recipe couldn’t get any better, it’s low carb too! I omitted the rice for a healthier low carb option but trust me you won’t miss it if you usually like stuffed peppers with rice. As much as I like chicken and turkey Italian sausage for some reason I prefer using regular pork sausage for this recipe but you could totally use Italian turkey or chicken sausage if you really wanted to be real good.\n\nThe finishing touch to this recipe is the Balsamic Glaze. It adds the final touch to this delicious recipe. I like to garnish it with more rosemary and basil for a super yummy and flavorful dinner.\n\n**Have you tried this recipe?

This is a super simple recipe where the zucchini is either sliced or shredded, or even shaved/ribboned and lightly cooked in oil along with garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes. A creamy sauce is made with a combination of ricotta cheese, parmesan, lemon and pepper. Ricotta is pretty thick so enough of the water that the pasta was cooked in is added to thin it out a bit and create a lusciously creamy sauce!

This sauce-soaked, herb-loaded wonder is exactly the kind of chicken I like.\n\n![Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken and rice with bite on fork.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-5.jpg)\n\nIt’s the time of year when I start to build my meal plans around getting outdoors as much as possible. I know what’s coming (WINTER) and I know how much I will be outside (HARDLY AT ALL) so I’m doing my best to really lean into those summer flavors and the kinds of meals that naturally bring you outside into the sun. And if those meals can put loads of fresh summer herbs to good use, double win.\n\nFor that reason this recipe serves two purposes:\n\n*   Getting you outside into the sun / fresh air to boost the mood a bit.\n*   Giving you the foundation for all good things: that zingy, salty, herb-loaded coconut lime sauce.\n\n![Coconut lime sauce in a food processor.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-1.jpg)\n\nCoconut milk, lime juice, lime zest, fish sauce, cilantro mint garlic oh my. This. Sauce. Is. So. Good.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that between recipe development, photos, and video, the three people working on this recipe (working out of three separate locations) each ended up with slightly different looking sauces. One thin, one medium, one thick.\n\nThe lesson: coconut milk can vary greatly from can to can and brand to brand, and how much lime sauce you add (and whether you measure or just squeeze) can also impact the final coconut lime sauce texture. I’d recommend just starting with what’s written and then adjust as needed.\n\n![Grilling chicken on a grill.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-2.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the day, chicken and rice never fails, but it EXTRA never fails us when it’s serves as a blank canvas to holds all the flavors of that cool, creamy sauce.\n\nA little char on the chicken, a fresh squeeze of lime, hot sticky rice, and a heavy dousing of puckery coconut lime sauce.

Not one but two people on our team made it and convinced me I needed to try it_! _They were not wrong. The Food52 recipe was authored by Asha Loupy.

[This is olive oil](https://amzn.to/3hwcVGc) is generally considered the gold standard for affordable but excellent.  \n**Parmesan:** Freshly grated parmesan is preferred here because it melts and browns extremely nicely, but the bagged pre-shredded stuff works just fine.  \n**Salt & pepper:** You don’t really need more seasoning than a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, but if you’d like to experiment with flavors, try adding a little garlic powder or Italian seasoning.\n\n![Parmesan being sprinkled on zucchini slices before baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo.jpg)\n\nHow to Make the Best Baked Parmesan Zucchini (Tips and Tricks)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Be strategic about how you slice your zucchini:** Prefer softer zucchini? Slice it into thinner rounds, around 1/4-inch thick. Like your baked zucchini on the firmer side? Cut it thicker, closer to 1/2-inch.  \n**Don’t skip the broiler:** The final step in this recipe after roasting your zucchini is to switch on the broiler and broil the rounds for just a couple minutes. This makes the cheese extra toasty and delicious. But keep a close eye on your zucchini while the broiler is going. Food under the broiler can burn very quickly, so you never want to leave your broiler unattended.\n\n![Collage photo of parmesan zucchini before and after baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-picture.jpg)\n\n### What to Serve With Cheesy Roasted Zucchini?\n\nThese bites are great alongside almost anything, particularly simple lunch sandwiches or:\n\n*   [Tomato Soup](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-tomato-soup-recipe-for-two/)\n*   [Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwiches](https://bakingmischief.com/pesto-grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Sausage Pasta](https://bakingmischief.com/creamy-sausage-pasta/)\n*   [Buttered Noodles](https://bakingmischief.com/buttered-noodles/)\n\n**Bonus Tip:** _If you have leftover [Pizza Sauce](https://bakingmischief.com/best-homemade-pizza-sauce/) or marinara sauce in your fridge, serve these as a snack and use them for dipping. You can even add chopped  pepperoni if you have it (layer it under the parmesan before baking)._ \n\n![Overhead photo of baked parmesan zucchini on a plate.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo-overhead.jpg)\n\n### More Easy Vegetable Sides\n\n*   [Roasted Zucchini](https://bakingmischief.com/roasted-zucchini/)\n*   [Butter and Garlic Green Beans](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-roasted-green-beans/)\n*   [Broccoli in the Oven](https://bakingmischief.com/broccoli-in-the-oven/)\n*   [Corn on the Cob in the Microwave](https://bakingmischief.com/microwave-corn-on-the-cob/)\n\n![Close up photo of baked parmesan zucchini on a plate.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-image-square-2-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 2 medium zucchini sliced into 1/4 to 1/2-inch rounds\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper\n*   ▢ 1 cup freshly grated parmesan pre-shredded is also fine\n\n*   Preheat oven to 450°F and line a broil-safe baking sheet with foil (optional for easier clean up).\n    \n*   Place zucchini slices on baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.

    "markdown": "# Crisp Gnocchi With Brussels Sprouts and Brown Butter Recipe\nTotal Time\n\n20 minutes\n\nRating\n\n5(18,387)\n\nNotes\n\n[Read community notes](#notes_section)\n\nFor a fantastic meal that can be ready in 20 minutes, toss together seared gnocchi and sautéed brussels sprouts with lemon zest, red-pepper flakes and brown butter. The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.\n\n* * *\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nYield:4 servings\n\n*   1pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)\n*   1lemon\n*   4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n*   Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper\n*   ½teaspoon red-pepper flakes\n*   1(18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi\n*   6tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces\n*   ½teaspoon honey\n*   Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving\n\n[Ingredient Substitution Guide](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/79-substitutions-for-cooking)\n\n##### Nutritional analysis per serving (4 servings)\n\n526 calories; 33 grams fat; 13 grams saturated fat; 0 grams trans fat; 15 grams monounsaturated fat; 2 grams polyunsaturated fat; 52 grams carbohydrates; 8 grams dietary fiber; 5 grams sugars; 11 grams protein; 697 milligrams sodium\n\nNote: The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)\n    \n2.  In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.\n    \n3.  In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.\n    \n\nRatings\n-------\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\nor to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\n### Private Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n-------------\n\nDear NY Times stylist, thanks for using my father's, Michael Lax's, teak handled, cast iron, skillet, the large one, by Copco. Great skillets, but note, if you find one, due to the selection of the teak handle, you cannot put them into the oven. My father was an industrial designer and designed/started Copco. The NYTimes ran his obituary in 1999. He was a diehard New Yorker, born and raised in the west village on Morton Street and he went to Alfred University in the Industrial Ceramics dept.\n\nRather than honey, I substituted a splash of aged balsamic for sweetness as well as a touch of acidity.\n\nThis works great with the Trader Joe’s Cauliflower Gnocchi too.\n\nThis was so good! We roasted the brussel sprouts to make them really crispy and then added them to the skillet along with a shallot and chopped garlic after crisping the gnocchi. Also topped it with a dollop of lemon zested garlic ricotta to finish. It was over the top delicious!\n\nI guess I'm the only whose brussel sprouts didn't cook in five minutes. I tried to follow this using the timing but ended up with hard brussel sprouts so I had to add liquid and let it simmer\n\nFabulous! Life required that I roast the sprouts. I prepared as directed with lemon zest and red pepper flakes. My helper popped them in oven at 425. They cooked for 25 minutes to perfection. By time I got home, I had enough time to prepare gnocchi as directed before roasting was complete.. I had to make 2 batches for crowd I was feeding - first one used 6 T butter, second batch 4T. Four was plenty. Used balsamic instead of honey. Will make again and again !\n\nI have done this with pancetta rather than butter. It's fantastic, and it also would be almost as good with butter..\n\nMade this into a true 20 min meal by baking the Brussels sprouts in the oven (15 min at 450 degrees) while simultaneously cooking the gnocchi on the stove top. Mixed them together on stovetop at the very end as recipe says. Also, 6 tablespoons of butter seems crazy - I added 2 and my gnocchi were deliciously buttery and crispy! Quick and easy, would definitely make again.\n\nMy kids only dabbled in the brussels sprouts (understandable, and: more veggies for me!), but mainly stuck to the gnocchi. My wife - hates \"cabbage-y\" things - was astonished by how good it was. In my family, this counts as a success. However: - This took much more than 20 minutes, more like 40. - I rounded up on the portions (I live in Europe and buy in grams). Nonetheless, there weren't any leftovers. Feeds four? Feeds two adults and two toddlers. Well.\n\nIf the gnocchi immediately sticking to the pan like glue freaks you out like it did me the first time, don’t worry. It will release once the butter melts (and with a nice golden brown crust). Do make sure they are completely broken up before they go into the pan though.\n\nFollowed exactly, except my sprouts were big so I quartered them. It took more than 2 min for the butter to brown but once it did, magic. Don’t skimp on the lemon zest and don’t be afraid of some bigger chunks of it after chopping — fried in the butter and honey they are a delightful contrast to the rest of the dish. Don’t overdo the Parmesan at the end, a light sprinkle does the job.\n\nWhy decide between Pancetta and Butter when you can have both?!? One of the best things I’ve cooked at home in recent memory.\n\nCooked this last night and it was delicious. Next time I would double the Brussels sprouts and roast them instead of frying (my pan isn't big enough to properly fry that many sprouts!), try reducing the amount of butter by half (there was so much butter pooled at the bottom of my bowl when we finished it off!), then add the roasted sprouts into the pan to toss with the gnocchi at the very end. We didn't add the Parm because I was lazy and didn't bring it to the table, and didn't miss it one bit!\n\nI think some aged balsamic might be a good substitute for the honey.\n\nWe loved this one! I think the secret is a cast-iron skillet. This was the first recipe I’ve ever attempted in my cast-iron, and I am now a believer! I would probably throw in some bacon next time. And a handful of toasted pinenuts.\n\nLove this recipe! I did sub the honey and red pepper flakes with Mike's Hot Honey and added some rotisserie chicken to the mix.\n\nUsed pancetta (why not?) and was somehow lacking lemon, so used orange zest instead, which was honestly fantastic. What a lovely, tasty one skillet meal.\n\nThis is one of our absolute favorites! I use Brussels Sprouts and cut down the butter a bit. A regular in our house and often doubled (even for only 2 people) to have plenty of leftovers.\n\nDidn’t expect this to work so well but it was superb - like others, perhaps doesn’t need quite that much butter… Brussels Sprouts in a fry pan - awesome trick… Gnocchi in a frypan - awesome trick…. Put them together - amazing meal!\n\nI used chickpea gnocchi for added protein- A delicious dish!\n\nOven roasted the sprouts Halved the butter Added drizzle of lemon juice to the gnocchi at the end\n\nI think I messed this up. It was delicious but messy and super gooey. The brussel sprouts were fantastic but the gnocchi were gooey. Maybe I got the wrong kind? Definitely would try again and see about adding less butter. I was left with lots of extra butter in the pan. I also added mushrooms cause I love them but they probably added extra liquid.\n\nDelicious! For those saying the brussels don’t cook, cover them first while they’re browning. We added a bit of pancetta since we had it and needed to use it up. And why not. Just cooked that first then added the brussels and carried on. Decrease the salt if you do this. We also added more red pepper since we like it. This was absolutely amazing. Half way through eating, we decided to also squeeze some lemon on some of it, and it really gave a nice lift. Make this!\n\nI'm obsessed with this recipe! Sometimes I substitute tteok (Korean rice cakes) for the gnocchi and it takes it to a whole different level.\n\nI added hot Italian sausage and nixed the lemon zest. Hot honey and a drizzle of balsamic glaze at the end and it was absolutely delicious! The timing definitely took a bit longer than what the recipe suggests, but definitely worth it!\n\nLove it, we have made this 50+ times with the following changes: 1. Roast sprouts @ 425F. The listed method is not enough time to cook all the way thru. Add them after browning butter. Protip: Preheat your baking pan! They should sizzle on contact 2. Use 4-5 tbsp butter instead of 6 3. Add 2-3 cloves minced garlic 1 min from done 4. Sub honey for hot honey\n\nThis has become a staple in our house. We have made it over 50 times at this point. But we have evolved the recipe into our own so here are my recommendations: 1. Roast your brussels sprouts cut side down @ 425F instead of sautéing. The listed method is not enough time to cook all them all the way through. Toss them in after you brown the butter. Protip: preheat your baking pan, sprouts should sizzle immediately on contact 2. Let the gnocchi get browned on all sides 3. Add a couple cloves of min\n\nVery surprised by all the positive reviews. Both dry (notice lack of any sauce other than…butter) and extremely greasy (see previous note re: butter). If I try again might boil the gnocchi prior to frying to see if it adds some moisture, halve the butter, and double the ratio of Brussels to gnocchi.\n\nThis dish had no right to be as delicious as it was! The ingredients are simple and so are the techniques you use. It doesn't all make sense on paper but it comes together wonderfully! Crunchy gnocchi and brussel sprouts. Slightly hot from the red pepper flakes, a little sweet from the honey, and with the slightest hint of lemon. And the parmesan at the end! So subtle but so good! Definitely making this again and can't wait to try with the different variations of cruciferous vegetables!\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you."

Seared chicken, fresh mozzarella and tomato halves, creamy avocado slices and shredded basil leaves are drizzled with an incredible balsamic **dressing that doubles as a marinade** for the ultimate salad!\n\nBalsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad… Now THIS was and still is a family favourite!\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-301.jpg)\n\nWith so many Caprese recipes making their way onto Cafe Delites, like our [Caprese Grilled Cheese](https://cafedelites.com/caprese-grilled-cheese/) and [Grilled Chicken Cypress with Buffalo Mozzarella](https://cafedelites.com/grilled-chicken-caprese/), this salad has been a long time coming. My list of recipes is getting so out of control, I’ve made the extremely difficult decision to STAHP adding to it, and actually start COOKING from it. Best. Decision. Ever. And I have a feeling this salad is going to be your next favourite. Because who doesn’t love Balsamic Chicken AND Caprese _in the one sentence?_\n\n### How To Make The Best Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad\n\nTraditionally, Caprese salads do not contain any balsamic vinegar OR avocados or chicken, but today, however, that has changed to make way for this bowl of epic flavours.\n\nTaking some inspiration from this [Balsamic Glazed Caprese Chicken](https://cafedelites.com/balsamic-glazed-caprese-chicken-recipe/), you’re first going to marinade your chicken:\n\n*   You only need to use 4 tablespoons of the balsamic marinade.\n*   You’re going to reserve the **remaining dressing to use later in the refrigerator!** _No_, we don’t use the OLD marinade as a dressing. We use the _FRESH UNTOUCHED_ marinade.\n*   Then, you’re going to sear said chicken until crispy on the edges and golden. For this salad I used boneless, skinless thighs, BUT you can use breasts if you wish.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nAfter that, the salad comes together _so FAST_. Throw all ingredients into a bowl and dress with the reserved dressing.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-16.jpg)\n\nJuicy, golden balsamic chicken………fresh grape or cherry tomatoes……fresh baby mozzarella balls (or bocconcini).\n\n### Substitutions\n\n*   You can use cherry tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes, or use chopped Roma tomatoes.\n*   Fresh mozzarella balls are best in this. You can use any size if you can’t find mini.\n*   Romaine, butter, ice berg or spinach are all fine to use as the base.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-20.jpg)![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-19.jpg)\n\nSay hello to your new favourite salad.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-21.jpg)\n\nIf you love this salad, you’ll love this [BLT Balsamic Chicken Avocado & Feta Salad](https://cafedelites.com/blt-balsamic-chicken-avocado-feta-salad/) OR this [Grilled Lemon Herb Mediterranean Chicken Salad](https://cafedelites.com/grilled-lemon-herb-mediterranean-chicken-salad-recipe/)!\n\n#### WATCH THIS Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad BEING MADE RIGHT HERE!\n\n  \n\n![](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-301-1-200x200.jpg)\n\n### Marinade/Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup (60 mL) balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons (30 mL) olive oil\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons brown sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon minced garlic\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon dried basil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon salt\n\n### Salad:\n\n*   ▢ 4 chicken thigh fillets, skin removed (no bone)\\*\n*   ▢ 5 cups Romaine, (or cos) lettuce leaves, washed and dried\n*   ▢ 1 avocado, sliced\n*   ▢ 1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced\n*   ▢ ½ cup mini mozzarella / bocconcini cheese balls\n*   ▢ ¼ cup basil leaves, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper, to season\n\n*   Whisk marinade ingredients together to combine.

It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-e1541953546118.jpg)\n\nThen roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-e1541953605651.jpg)\n\nUsing your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame.\n\nLightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce remove excess dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-e1541953690862.jpg)\n\nLift your tray and carefully turn upside down on a parchment paper lined baking tray. \n\nThe pumpkin ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. \n\nCollect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of pumpkin raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n\nAdd your fresh pumpkin ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. \n\nsage butter, apples and pecans\n------------------------------\n\nWhile your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat.  You want to stir them often or they will burn. \n\nCook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant.  Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside.\n\nNext, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat.  Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce apples and butter](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-e1541953820985.jpg)\n\nThen add your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 – 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry.\n\nOnce your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumpkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat.  Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n\n**pro tips for perfect pumpkin ravioli**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don’t want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don’t forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can’t emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don’t!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 – 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn’t seem like much but you don’t want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce bowl](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-e1541953937768.jpg)\n\n**can you make ravioli without a pasta machine?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely!

While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n    \n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don't want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don't forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can't emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don't!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 - 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn't seem like much but you don't want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n![](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/400dpiLogoCropped-1024x214.jpg)\n\nServing: 8g | Calories: 426.8kcal | Carbohydrates: 42.6g | Protein: 13.9g | Fat: 23.4g | Saturated Fat: 11.8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 3g | Monounsaturated Fat: 7.3g | Cholesterol: 143mg | Sodium: 723.2mg | Potassium: 164.1mg | Fiber: 3.5g | Sugar: 5.4g | Vitamin A: 3650IU | Vitamin C: 2.6mg | Calcium: 149mg | Iron: 2.4mg\n\n**Update Notes:** This post was originally published in November 2018 but was republished with an updated recipe, new photos, step by step instructions and tips in July of 2020."

    "markdown": "# Potato Stacks with Garlic, Thyme, and Parmesan - Little Broken\n_Potato stacks are the perfect side dish for a dinner party or holiday meal. They’re made with cream, fresh thyme, garlic, nutmeg, parmesan cheese, and potatoes. The crispy potatoes have a soft, creamy center piled with flavor._\n\n[![potato stacks](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-6.jpg)](https://www.littlebroken.com/creamy-potato-stacks-with-garlic-thyme-and-parmesan/)\n\n**What are Potato Stacks?**\n---------------------------\n\nThis potato dish is the star of any dinner table or holiday meal as it’s similar to **[scalloped potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/ina-garten-scalloped-potatoes/)**. The edges of the potatoes become crispy from the metal muffin cups while the center is perfectly tender. Parmesan cheese is an excellent pairing with potatoes, and this dish is no exception. You can substitute your favorite type of melty cheese if you prefer.\n\nIf your oven is full of other holiday dishes, you can cook these crispy herb potato stacks in the air fryer or counter oven instead. Even though this side dish is made with humble potato, the flavor combinations in this recipe will have you making this dish again and again.\n\nLooking for an easier potato side dish? Try our **[Cheesy Baked Mashed Potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/cheesy-mashed-potatoes/)** or **[Scalloped Potatoes with Cheese](https://www.littlebroken.com/cheesy-scalloped-potatoes/)**.\n\n![muffin tin potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-8.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients**\n---------------\n\nYou can find these simple ingredients in your local grocery store.\n\n*   **Heavy cream:** Heavy cream gives the potatoes a creamy flavor and bakes without separating.\n\n*   **Thyme leaves:** For best flavor, use fresh thyme. \n\n*   **Garlic:** Make sure the garlic is fresh and smells strongly of garlic for the best results.\n\n*   **Nutmeg:** This is a wonderfully warm fall spice. \n\n*   **Russet potatoes:** Russet potatoes are ideal for making these potato stacks but you can also use another starchy potato instead. Some great options include Yukon gold potatoes or white, yellow, or purple potatoes. Don’t use small fingerlings or petite potatoes since they won’t hold up as well.\n\n*   **[Kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2uFhEm0)**: Salt is important for potatoes to balance the starch. \n\n*   **Black pepper:** Freshly cracked black pepper adds flavor and a bit of spice.   \n\n*   **Parmesan cheese:** This hard, strong cheese pairs wonderfully with potatoes.   \n\n![ingredients for potato stacks recipe](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Ingredients.jpg)\n\n**What’s the Best Way to Slice the Potatoes?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe beauty of these crispy potato stacks are the thin slices of potatoes that create these little mounds.\n\n**Mandoline Slicer:** The best way to get your potatoes the perfect consistent slices is to use a **[mandoline slicer](https://amzn.to/3RWaTBh)**. This very sharp tool is used to make thinly sliced potatoes, other vegetables, fruit, cheese, or meat.\n\nYou do this by sliding the ingredient along the edge of the horizontal blade on the lowest setting. Be sure to use caution, as you can easily cut your fingers if you’re not careful.\n\n**Chef’s Knife:** If you don’t have a mandoline slicer, you can use a **[chef’s knife](https://amzn.to/3ByyQZX)** instead. The safest way to do this is to cut a slice off the bottom of the potato to get it to sit flat on the surface. Keeping your fingers out of the way, make cuts as thin as possible with a sharp knife.\n\n![sliced potatoes in a bowl](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Step.jpg)\n\n**How to Make Potato Stacks**\n-----------------------------\n\nHere are some brief instructions on how to make these cheesy stacks. You can find the full recipe below.\n\n1.  Prepare a standard muffin tray with nonstick cooking spray.\n2.  Warm together cream, thyme, garlic, and nutmeg in a small saucepan.\n3.  Toss the potato slices with salt and pepper and layer them into stacks in the prepared muffin pan.\n4.  Spoon the cream over each potato stack and then sprinkle with parmesan cheese.\n5.  Bake until the potatoes are knife tender and golden brown on top.\n6.  Remove the muffin pan from the oven and let sit. Run a knife around the edges to loosen up the stacks and carefully remove them to a serving platter.\n\n![potatoes with cream in muffin pan](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Step2.jpg)\n\n**Recipe Tips**\n---------------\n\nHere are a few tips and tricks to ensure you get the best crispy parmesan potato stacks every single time.\n\n*   **Garnish!** Top each potato stack with a sprig of fresh herbs for a beautiful presentation. \n*   **Get the right size potatoes.** Make sure you buy medium to small-size potatoes so they fit in a standard muffin pan.\n*   **No need to peel potatoes.** In a hurry? Feel free to leave the skin on the potatoes before slicing them. Just clean the outside and scrub away any dirt.\n*   **Heavy cream is the key.** Do not replace heavy cream with half and half or milk. It will not thicken during baking and you’ll end up with oily potatoes.\n\n**Variations**\n--------------\n\nYou can easily make this tasty side dish with your favorite ingredients. Here are some options you can try:\n\n*   Use other fresh herbs like rosemary or oregano. If you don’t have fresh herbs, you can use dried herbs instead.\n*   Melty cheese like gruyere cheese, Havarti, mozzarella cheese, comte, cheddar, asiago, or romano.  \n*   Use your favorite seasonings depending on what you’re serving the potatoes with. Try using ginger, cardamom, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, or cayenne pepper. \n\n![stacked potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-7.jpg)\n\n**Other Ways to Cook This Dish**\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you aren’t able to use your oven because it’s been taken over by the **[Thanksgiving turkey](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-turkey-breast/)**, you can also cook these potato stacks in an **[air fryer](https://amzn.to/3RHQTCW)** or countertop oven.\n\nSimply prepare the potatoes as you normally would in the muffin tin and then pop it in the air fryer at 350 degrees and cook until the potatoes are soft all the way through.\n\nGarnish potato stacks with more parmesan cheese after they come out of the oven for added richness and flavor!\n\n![recipe for potato stacks](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-11.jpg)\n\n**Storing Tips**\n----------------\n\n**Refrigerate:** Store these potato stacks in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. \n\n**Reheat:** You can reheat them in 30-second increments in the microwave until they’re heated through.\n\n**Freeze:** To freeze them, make the stacks in the oven, allow them to cool completely, place them in a single layer in a container, and store in the freezer for up to three months. Potatoes might not have the same texture and taste when thawed.\n\n**FAQs**\n--------\n\n****Do I need to use heavy cream to make potato stacks?****\n\nYou can make these potato stacks dairy-free with olive oil or bacon fat instead. They will not be as creamy but will have deliciously crispy edges.\n\n****What else can I top potato stacks with?****\n\nBesides topping them with fresh herbs, you can top them with cooked bacon.\n\n****How can I tell when the potatoes are done cooking?****\n\nYour fork or sharp knife should slide right through the stack with no resistance when they’re done baking.\n\n**Video: How to Make Potato Stacks**\n------------------------------------\n\n**More Holiday Side Dishes**\n----------------------------\n\n*   **[Hasselback Potato Gratin](https://www.littlebroken.com/hasselback-potato-gratin/)**\n*   **[Lemon Asparagus Risotto](https://www.littlebroken.com/asparagus-and-lemon-risotto-7-tips-on-how-to-make-the-perfect-risotto/)**\n*   **[Red Skin Mashed Potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/red-skin-mashed-potatoes-recipe/)**\n*   **[Roasted Asparagus with Lemon](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-asparagus-with-lemon/)**\n\n[Print](https://www.littlebroken.com/creamy-potato-stacks-with-garlic-thyme-and-parmesan/print/10492/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\n_Creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside, these creamy potato stacks are simple to make, delicious to eat, and really can’t be beat. It’s my new favorite way to serve potatoes for the holidays!_\n\n* * *\n\n*   1 1/2 cups heavy cream\n*   1 sprig fresh thyme\n*   2 garlic cloves, _minced_\n*   1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg\n*   2 lbs. medium russet potatoes (about 4-5), _peeled and sliced 1/8 to 1/16 inch thick_\n*   1 tsp. [kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2uFhEm0)\n*   1/2 tsp. black pepper\n*   Freshly grated parmesan cheese\n\n#### Special Tools\n\n*   **[12 cup standard muffin pan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003W0UMPI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003W0UMPI&linkCode=as2&tag=littbrok-20&linkId=6X4VZ2N25Q4H3SDR)**\n*   **[Mandoline slicer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001THGPDO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001THGPDO&linkCode=as2&tag=littbrok-20&linkId=IZC2357SOUAOKVX7)**\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n* * *\n\n1.  Preheat the oven to 375F. Spray 12 cup standard muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.\n2.  In a small sauce pan, whisk together cream, thyme, garlic, and nutmeg. Bring to a slow simmer and remove from the heat. You want the cream just heated through. Discard the thyme.\n3.  Toss the potato slices with salt and pepper and layer them into stacks in the prepared muffin cups, filling each one to the top but not over the top.\n4.  Spoon cream over each potato stack, filling almost to the top. You will have a couple or so slices exposed. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.\n5.  Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the potatoes are knife tender and golden brown on top.\n6.  Remove the muffin pan from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edges to loosen up the stacks and carefully remove them to a serving platter. Serve immediately.\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Potatoes:** Other starchy potatoes can be used instead, such as Yukon gold potatoes or white, yellow, or purple potatoes.\n*   **Cream:** For best results, do not replace heavy cream with half and half or another milk alternative. In my experience, half and half will separate during baking, and potatoes turn out oily. \n*   **Leftovers:** Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\n\n### Nutrition\n\n*   **Serving Size:** 1 potato stack\n*   **Calories:** 164\n*   **Sugar:** 1.8 g\n*   **Sodium:** 251.7 mg\n*   **Fat:** 11.5 g\n*   **Carbohydrates:** 13.1 g\n*   **Protein:** 3 g\n*   **Cholesterol:** 35.2 mg\n\n_Recipe originally published November 2015_\n\nYou May Also Like…\n------------------"

flipping them over about halfway through.\n\n![a cookie sheet with baked sweet potato rounds](https://www.cookingonthefrontburners.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Sweet-Potato-Goat-Cheese-Appetizers-5.jpg)\n\nThe sweet potatoes should be soft when done.  Check them to make sure the bottoms don't get too dark after about 25 minutes in the oven.\n\n![a bowl with goat cheese and adding honey](https://www.cookingonthefrontburners.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Sweet-Potato-Goat-Cheese-Appetizers-3.jpg)\n\nIn a medium bowl place the goat cheese, heavy cream and the honey.  Use a mixer to combine;

It takes 15 minutes to make and everyone loves it!_ \n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-1.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! \")_This post is sponsored by Kroger._ \n\nThe holidays are right around the corner and today I am sharing my “go to” appetizer. This easy **Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini** is SO easy and party goers always ooh and ahh over it. I always love watching my friends and family take a bite for the first time. It is one of those recipes where people close their eyes and say: wow, yum, mmmm, so good, amazing, and some even make weird noises, which is kind of awkward at a party, but this crostini is THAT good! And they love it even more when they find out how easy it is to make!\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-2.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! Your guests will LOVE it! \")\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to Cincinnati for a blogging event with [Kroger](https://www.kroger.com/). We have been working with Kroger this year so it was fun to see the headquarters, meet with the Kroger team, and spend time with the other Kroger bloggers.\n\nKroger asked every blogger to prepare a recipe for a holiday meal. We all shopped, cooked, and ate together and it was so much fun. We used the new [ClickList](https://www.kroger.com/onlineshopping/signin?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kroger.com%2Fstorecatalog%2Fservlet%2FOnlineShoppingStoreSetup) program to do our grocery shopping. We ordered our groceries online and then picked them up at the Kroger store.\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-7.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! It only takes 15 minutes to make! \")\n\nFor the holiday meal, I made my favorite Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini. I knew it would be a hit with the group!\n\nSo let’s talk about how easy this recipe is. I told you easy and I mean EASY. The appetizer starts with a baguette, but I don’t even have to slice it because I always buy the perfectly sliced baguette at Kroger (Smith’s in Utah). Next, I spread apple butter on the bread slices. I don’t make the apple butter, I totally cheat and use Private Selection Apple Butter. It is perfectly spiced and tastes amazing.\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-5.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! \")\n\nOn top of the apple butter, I place slices of creamy [Murray’s Cheese Brie](http://www.murrayscheese.com/). I place the crostini in the oven until the brie gets all melty and gooey. Remove from the oven and top with candied pecans and a drizzle of honey. At home, I use my homemade [candied pecans](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/candied-pecans/) because I always have them on hand, but at the event I used Private Selections candied pecans and they are really tasty! Kroger really does have everything!\n\nAt the event, I also tried Private Selection’s Vanilla and Nutmeg Infused Honey and oh my goodness! It was the perfect ending to my crostini. If you can’t find it, any honey will do, but that honey is amazing!\n\nThe Brie, Apple, and Honey was the perfect start to our holiday feast! Everyone loved it. And let me tell you, when a group of bloggers makes a holiday meal, you leave very full and very happy. I was amazed by all of the creative and delicious dishes. I wish we could make dinner together every night!\n\nThis easy Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini is the perfect holiday appetizer. It takes about 15 minutes to make and your guests will be raving about it until the next holiday season.

It’s perfect for holiday entertaining, or you can even turn this into an easy fix it and forget it type of dinner — just like we did tonight.\n\nMy grandmother always made the most amazing cocktail meatballs whenever my parents had their annual Christmas party. Everything was made from scratch, from the meatballs to the sauce, and these were some awesome meatballs. Honestly, all of the guests raved about them!\n\nSo, I’ve been trying to find my grandma’s recipe, without much luck. But in the meantime, I have an easy cocktail meatball recipe that tastes just as good and is made entirely in your slow cooker. Seriously.\n\nUpdate! Here’s the [homemade cocktail party meatball](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/homemade-cocktail-party-meatballs/) recipe!\n\nThis recipe is inspired by our favorite [**cranberry orange ham**](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/cranberry-orange-crock-pot-ham/), which we usually have for Christmas dinner. And, it only uses five ingredients. You can’t beat that!\n\nYou start off with some pre-cooked frozen meatballs — You can use your favorite recipe for **[homemade meatballs](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/homemade-meatballs/)**, or you can buy them from the store — just make sure that they’re fully cooked.\n\n[![crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-in-slow-cooker](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-in-slow-cooker-.jpg)](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-in-slow-cooker/)\n\nYou put them into a slow cooker — I used a small one, but if you’re  cooking for a crowd, you can easily double the recipe and make these in a larger Crock-Pot.\n\nThen, you add some orange marmalade and cranberry sauce, plus the remaining ingredients, stir, and cook on high for two hours. After that, you can let the meatballs simmer on low until you’re read to serve them.\n\nEasy peasy? Definitely!\n\n[![crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-with-sauce-in-slow-cooker-meatloafandmelodrama-com](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-with-sauce-in-slow-cooker-meatloafandmelodrama.com_.jpg)](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-with-sauce-in-slow-cooker-meatloafandmelodrama-com/)\n\nThe sauce is thick, tangy and slightly sweet, and the meatballs are super tender and juicy.\n\n[![crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-appetizer-recipe](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-appetizer-recipe.jpg)](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-appetizer-recipe/)\n\nRecipe for Crock-Pot cranberry orange meatballs\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*   ▢ 20 frozen meatballs (can use homemade or your favorite brand)\n*   ▢ 1 can jellied cranberry sauce\n*   ▢ ½ cup orange marmalade\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [dried minced onions](https://amzn.to/2PcaD1K)\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil or non-stic cooking spray\n\n*   Add olive oil to slow cooker, or use non-stick cooking spray\n    \n*   Add meatballs, and top with remaining ingredients\n    \n*   Stir to coat meatballs, cover and cook on high for 2 hours.

They’re also Vegan, Gluten Free, Sugar Free and Grain Free._\n\n**Edit:** the photos for this recipe were updated on 10/2019.\n\nWhat do you eat when it’s too cold for a smoothie, pancakes sound too complicated, and you’ve had oats for breakfast for way too many days in a row?\n\nFluffy Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls, of course!\n\n![ingredients for sweet potato breakfast bowl on round white cutting board](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl.jpg)\n\nThese sweet little spuds have made their way onto our [lunch](https://frommybowl.com/sweet-potato-boats-tahini-dressing/) and [dinner](https://frommybowl.com/sweet-potato-peanut-stew/) plates, so why is it that we don’t enjoy them for breakfast as well? To be honest, I’m not quite sure. Which is why I’m here to change that 😉\n\nThese Sweet Potato Bowls are _kind_ of like a smoothie bowl…but warm! Think **fluffy, caramel-y whipped sweet potatoes** infused with cinnamon and some healthy plant based fats, then sprinkled with some glorious toppings like pomegranate and pumpkin seeds. Are you drooling yet?\n\n![hand pouring milk into large bowl of sweet potato piececs](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-2-200x300.jpg)![hand mixer whipping sweet potato breakfast bowls in large glass bowl](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-3-200x300.jpg)\n\nObviously you can top your bowls with whatever you would like, but I was trying to stick with the winter theme here. And I must say, the combination of pomegranate, pumpkin seeds, cacao nibs, coconut yogurt, and some **[Easy Vegan Granola](https://frommybowl.com/easy-vegan-granola-recipe/)** is very, _very_ refreshing.\n\n![sweet potato breakfast bowls next to smaller bowls of topping ideas](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-4.jpg)\n\nI would be remiss if I forgot to mention that these Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls kinda taste like a healthy **[Sweet Potato Casserole](https://frommybowl.com/healthy-sweet-potato-casserole/)**. And who the _heck_ wouldn’t want to eat that for breakfast?! Because we are roasting our Sweet Potatoes before we whip them into their fluffy final product, they’re already naturally sweet. I personally thought they were great on their own, and didn’t feel the need to add any extra sugar to them. So not only are they vegan, but they are also gluten free, grain free, and sugar free as well!\n\nTo be honest, I don’t know if there are any more “free” labels out there that you’d even want to hit. So I’m going to stop my rambling, and get onto the good stuff (literally).\n\n![two sweet potato breakfast bowls topped with coconut yogurt, pomegranate seeds, and granola](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-8.jpg)\n\n### **A Few Final Thoughts:**\n\n*   There are many ways to cook a sweet potato, but I would **strongly recommend** that you roast them for this recipe. Steaming and microwaving your spuds does **not** make them as soft, sweet, or caramelized as the oven. You are ultimately your own boss in life, but you have officially been warned! (_Please just roast them. You’ll thank me later_.)\n*   These bowls can be enjoyed both warm and chilled, but I must say that I prefer them warm. If you heat them up in the microwave, the sweet potatoes won’t lose their moisture!\n*   Short on sweet potatoes? You can easily sub them for pumpkin or butternut squash puree instead! Just keep in mind that squash will be less sweet, so you may need to add in 1 to 2 tablespoons of sweetener. I would recommend maple syrup or coconut sugar.\n\nIf you’re looking for more vegan breakfast recipes, you’ll also love these **[Pumpkin Spice Latte Overnight Oats](https://frommybowl.com/pumpkin-spice-latte-overnight-oats/)** or these **[Salted Caramel Apple Breakfast Bars](https://frommybowl.com/salted-caramel-apple-breakfast-bars/)**!\n\nFinally, if you make this recipe and decide to share it on [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/frommybowl/) or [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/frommybowl/)**,** don’t forget to tag me [**@FromMyBowl**](https://www.instagram.com/frommybowl/) + #FromMyBowl!

Preheat your oven to 400F and line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Wash the sweet potatoes, but do not peel them. Piece the potatoes a few times with a knife, then place on the tray and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a “caramel” starts to ooze out of the pierced holes. (Note: If you have large sweet potatoes, I would recommend cutting them in half lengthwise and placing them cut side down on the baking tray to reduce cooking time).\n2.  Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven, and carefully scoop our their flesh into a large bowl. Add in the milk, flax, nut butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Use a hand mixer to “cream” the mixture together on for 60 to 90 seconds, starting with the lowest setting. Alternatively, you can place all ingredients into a food processor and blend until thick and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.\n3.  Divide into serving bowls, top as desired, and serve warm. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Substitutions****:** ground flax can be replaced with ground chia seeds, or omitted.\n*   **Time Hacks:**  roasted sweet potatoes are the _most_ sweet and tender, but you can also microwave them for a few minutes in a time crunch. If you already have sweet potato puree and would like to use it in this recipe, use 1 1/3 cups for this recipe (~330 g)\n\nHey there, I’m Caitlin!

A serving size is one-half of an acorn squash per person.\n*   When you’re roasting acorn squash, look for a little caramelization around the edges. This is an easy way to add extra flavor.\n*   In this sausage and apple stuffed acorn squash recipe, I use nitrate-free sausage, which is better for you.\n\n*   **To Store**: Once your leftover acorn squash has cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n*   **To Reheat**: Reheat in a microwave or in the oven at 350°F until heated through.\n\n*   **Tender chicken or pork**: This dish is a full meal on its own, but it also pairs wonderfully with my [grilled chicken thighs](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/grilled-chicken-thighs/) or easy [oven pork chops](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/easy-oven-pork-chop-recipe/).\n*   **A seasonal salad**: A fresh, fall-inspired salad, like my [shaved Brussels sprouts salad](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprouts-salad/) is the perfect side dish to serve with sausage stuffed acorn squash.\n*   **Roasted vegetables**: Savory roasted vegetables, such as [roasted cauliflower](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/spicy-roasted-cauliflower-recipe/) or [cabbage steaks](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/cabbage-steak-recipe/) provide a nice balance to the sweetness in this recipe.\n\n*   **Add grains:** To make this dish even more satisfying, add a whole grain to the filling, such as [wild rice](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-wild-rice-recipe/) or [quinoa](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/how-to-make-fluffy-quinoa/).\n*   **Top with cheese:** A salty, melty cheese would be so yummy on top. Try a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese or crumbled goat cheese.\n*   **Switch up the squash:** Enjoy all the winter squash while it’s in season and make a variation of this recipe with your favorite squash variety such as delicata squash. See my [stuffed butternut squash with Italian sausage](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/italian-sausage-stuffed-butternut-squash/) recipe for inspiration!\n*   **Nut:** top this recipe with your favorite nut such as [pecans](https://amzn.to/47GYtFJ), [almonds](https://amzn.to/47D4GCH) or [walnut](https://amzn.to/416CC87).\n\n*   [Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3Ro9Hta): The squash is roasted on a standard 9×13 baking sheet.\n*   [Skillet](https://amzn.to/3R4pZFX): A large skillet is needed to cook the filling.\n*   [Knife](https://amzn.to/47Zsj8j): This recipe requires some chopping, so you’ll need a nice sharp knife.\n\n****How do I prepare acorn squash?****\n\nFirst, you’ll want to start with a good acorn squash. Look for one that is dark green in color, heavy for its size, and has no blemishes. Then, using a sharp knife, you’ll cut the squash in half between one of the ridges. Because of its shape, acorn squash is easier to cut if you place it on a towel to hold it steady. Next, you’ll remove the stem and scoop out the pulp and seeds. Now, your squash is ready to roast and fill with your favorite ingredients!\n\n****Can I eat the skin of an acorn squash?****\n\nYes, you can! After roasting acorn squash, the skin becomes soft and tender enough to cut with a fork. However, if you’d rather not eat the skin, you can easily separate it from everything else and just enjoy the inside of the acorn squash.\n\n****Could I use another vegetable instead of acorn squash?****\n\nYou can create endless variations of this recipe using different vegetables. You’ll want to choose vegetables that are sturdy enough to hold the stuffing when they’re cooked, like bell peppers, eggplant, or potatoes. Other varieties of squash like butternut squash or zucchini also work great.\n\nMore Delicious Squash Recipes\n-----------------------------\n\nWant more seasonal recipes?

It remains one of the most popular salads on _The Forked Spoon_, especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nEvery year around November and December I remember this salad recipe and can’t get enough of it.\n\nMade with sweet pears, tangy feta cheese, crunchy pomegranates, and mellow walnuts – this nutritious salad is what salad dreams are made of. **It is my favorite salad ever**.

Log in here.\n\nBen and I both loved this dish so much, my immediate reaction is to want to share it with you all here!\n\nThis easy chicken dinner is my favorite kind of meal and the way I cook most often: a one-pan dinner that offers both protein and veggies so I don’t need to cook a separate side.\n\nI also always make sure I add a few flavor boosters so that even though the ingredients are simple (ahem, whatever I could dig out of my fridge), the recipe tastes special, intentional, and like something that really could have come from a cookbook, instead of its actual source—my moderately sleep-deprived brain after a glass of Cabernet.\n\nWELL, perhaps I do some of my best work after a glass of red, because what started as a throw-it-all-in, see-what-happens stand-up dinner turned out to be a meal that we truly loved and that I was ecstatic to eat a second time.\n\n![Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet. An easy weeknight dinner that's ready in 30 minutes!](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Chicken-Sweet-Potato-Kale-Skillet-with-Cranberries-Goat-Cheese.jpg)\n\nAbout This Easy, Healthy Chicken Recipe\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe core base ingredients (the ones I found in my fridge) are:\n\n*   **Chicken**. Originally I made the recipe with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, but since I only have that in my refrigerator once a year, I updated today’s version to use cooked, shredded chicken instead. If you need an easy way to make it, check out my [How to Cook Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-shredded-chicken/) for my favorite easy, foolproof method. [Crock Pot Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/crock-pot-shredded-chicken/) and [Baked Chicken Breast](https://www.wellplated.com/baked-chicken-breast/) are also great.\n\nIn an ideal world, I cook my shredded chicken in advance, but if you follow my method above, you can start the chicken cooking when you begin the recipe and it will be ready by the time you need to add it to the skillet with the veggies.\n\nFor an even greater shortcut, you can try this recipe with shredded store-bought rotisserie chicken.\n\n*   **Sweet Potatoes**. I almost always have one or two of these sweet orange beauties in my pantry. They are a quick and healthy add to almost any fall or winter dinner.\n*   **Kale**. Sturdy kale is ideal for stir-fry and skillet-type recipes like this because it can hold up to the heat and other bold flavors. The amount called for will seem like a lot at first, but it will cook down significantly.\n\n![Healthy Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet made with cranberries and goat cheese. Easy and healthy chicken dinner!](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Easy-Chicken-Recipe-with-Kale-Sweet-Potatoes-Goat-Cheese.jpg)\n\nNext, the flavor boosters! Don’t miss these. They make the recipe.\n\n*   **Goat Cheese**. Crumbled goat cheese melts into the nooks and crannies, makes the recipe creamy, and gives the dish just enough indulgence to make it taste satisfying. I like to stir in half, then leave the rest to crumble on top so that I get delightful little pockets of it with every forkful.\n*   **Balsamic Vinegar**. When I was first cooking this dish, I tasted it at the end and felt it lacked a little pop. A splash of balsamic vinegar did the trick! It brightens up the ingredients and balances the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes.\n*   **Fresh Herbs**. Use any mix of sage, rosemary, and thyme, all of which seem to make their way in and out of my refrigerator this time of year. I really recommend fresh over dried (dried doesn’t have the same wonderful effect). Look for the poultry herb mix, which usually offers all three.\n*   **Dried Cranberries or Pomegranate**. I love adding a handful of these little jewels anytime I’m doing a fall-themed recipe. The first time I used pomegranate seeds because we happened to have some leftover. The second I used dried cranberries, because we always have them around and I wanted to see how the dish would taste with more of a pantry staple. Answer: both are delicious! Feel free to choose your favorite.\n\nPomegranates feel fancier; dried cranberries are easier and still taste great.\n\n![Easy Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet.

This dish is yummy on its own, but I loved it most with a [brown and wild rice mix blend like this one](https://amzn.to/2UoNZ8A). If you’re looking to keep things low carb, try cauliflower rice.\n*   **Bread**. I also suspect this recipe would be delicious paired with thick slices of good-quality crusty bread.\n\n![Healthy chicken dinner recipe with sweet potatoes, kale, and cranberries.

Next, stir in the balsamic vinegar, sage, thyme, and cranberries. Crumble half of the goat cheese over the top, then stir so that it melts and becomes creamy. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Sprinkle the remaining goat cheese over the top, then serve hot over rice.\n    \n\n*   \\*In place of [shredded chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-shredded-chicken/), you can also cube the uncooked chicken and saute it in about 1 tablespoon olive oil at the beginning of the recipe. Remove it from the skillet, proceed with the recipe starting at Step 1, then add the chicken at the end. You can also use [Instant Pot Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/instant-pot-chicken/), [Baked Chicken Breast](https://www.wellplated.com/baked-chicken-breast/), or [Crock Pot Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/crock-pot-shredded-chicken/).\n*   \\*\\*For the sage, rosemary, and/or thyme, I suggest buying the “Poultry Blend” fresh herb packet, as it contains all three. You can also use one or all three of the herbs, depending upon what you have leftover.\n\nServing: 1of 4, about 2 cups (without rice)Calories: 509kcalCarbohydrates: 35gProtein: 59gFat: 16gSaturated Fat: 7gCholesterol: 148mgFiber: 9gSugar: 12g\n\nJoin today and start saving your favorite recipes\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nCreate an account to easily save your favorite recipes and access FREE meal plans.\n\n[Sign Me Up](https://www.wellplated.com/register/)\n\nYou May Also Like\n-----------------\n\nBreakfast & Brunch\n\n### [Western Omelette](https://www.wellplated.com/western-omelette/)\n\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/61f966c91c7744e98d39995df9e6ce45?s=96&r=g)\n\nHi, I'm Erin Clarke, and I'm fearlessly dedicated to making healthy food that's affordable, easy-to-make, and best of all DELISH.

This scrumptious Summer salad is fun, fruity, and flavorful, and topped with the most amazing homemade blueberry balsamic dressing._\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070.jpg)\n\nWhile I’m no stranger to [dumping blueberries into my salads](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/08/blueberry-broccoli-spinach-salad.html), I’ve never once considered blending them into a dressing. Well not until a berry dressing finally knocked my socks off, that is. There’s a sweet raspberry dressing at a local lunch spot here that has totally changed my mind about fruity dressings and holy cow I’ve been missing out!\n\nSince I suspect their berry dressing is laced with enough sugar to classify it as liquid candy, I figured I had two choices: embrace dessert salads and give up donuts in favor of sugar-laden greens \\*OR\\* make my own healthy berry salad dressing at home.\n\nObviously I chose the latter.\n\n_No way am I giving up donuts!_\n\nRaspberries don’t last long in this house, as my [pint-sized sidekick](https://peasandcrayons.com/chickpea), can clear out a carton in a sitting, so I decided to tackle the bucket of farm-fresh blueberries we picked the week prior.\n\nI blended a cup of berries into my go-to [balsamic dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2017/03/strawberry-steak-salad-with-homemade-balsamic-dressing.html) and had to talk myself down from polishing off the entire jar right then and there. I really am kicking myself for not jumping on the fruity dressing bandwagon when it first became a thing. It’s totally legit!\n\nBring on the berries!\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad topped with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peas-and-crayons-2.jpg)\n\n:: vegetarian :: gluten-free :: dairy-free :: paleo :: clean eating ::\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Spring Mix Salad with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 1 heaping cup blueberries\n*   ▢ 1 4-5 oz bag spring mix salad greens\n*   ▢ ½ English cucumber, chopped\n*   ▢ ½ cup mandarin orange segments\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [dried cranberries](https://amzn.to/2xfMnEi)\n*   ▢ 2-4 TBSP roasted unsalted sunflower seeds\n\n#### BLUEBERRY BALSAMIC DRESSING:\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup blueberries\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup [balsamic vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qdt4WJ)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP [red wine vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qgx73B)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 1 TBSP  honey\n*   ▢ 1 tsp salt I use sea salt\n*   ▢ ⅛ tsp black pepper\n*   ▢ ½ cup [avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2fyn7A) olive oil works too\n\n*   First make your dressing: In a [food processor](http://amzn.to/2re4Boz) or [blender](http://amzn.to/2rdX09u), combine all dressing ingredients except for the avocado oil. Blend until blueberries are completely pureed, then use the little top cut-out to drizzle in the avocado oil at the end. Once dressing is emulsified you're good to go!\n    \n*   Wash + dry your greens. \n    \n*   Combine with cucumber and blueberries, then toss with a drizzle or two of dressing. Add extra as desired.\n    \n*   Top with mandarin orange segments, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds and serve!\n    \n\nMaking this salad in advance? Go for it! Mix together everything minus the orange and dressing then combine when ready to serve!\n\nNOTE: This recipe makes a bottle's worth of dressing which will keep great in the fridge for future salads. Only want a little? Feel free to halve the recipe!\n\nRecipe yields 2 large salads or 4 side salads.\n\n_Nutrition Facts below are estimated using an online recipe nutrition calculator.

    "markdown": "# Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet | Greens & Chocolate\n**Butternut Squash Chicken Sausage and Kale Quinoa Skillet** is a stunning autumn dinner with **simple ingredients but BIG flavors**! \n\n![](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Butternut-Squash-Quinoa-Skillet-14.jpg.webp)\n\nOne of my favorite things about food blogging is when I come up with a recipe idea in my head and get to see it come to life in the kitchen.  While I don't always take the time to sit back and think \"hey!  that's pretty cool that I made that!\" I definitely did with this recipe.\n\nThis Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet was one of those recipe ideas that I just wasn't quite sure it was going to work out.  It was either going to be 'pretty good' but not blog-worthy, or 'REALLY FREAKING GOOD.'  Lucky for all of us, it was the latter!\n\nThe thing about a dish like this is that the flavors are so simple and uncomplicated, but work together perfectly.  From the sweet butternut squash (which is also delicious in this [Crunchy Honey Butternut Squash Casserole](https://greensnchocolate.com/crunchy-honey-butternut-squash-casserole/)!) and dried cherries to the smoky chicken sausage and tangy goat cheese - every bite is pure heaven!  Of course I couldn't help myself and added some kale, too.  I just love the stuff and my garden is still producing it, so I figured why not.  If you prefer spinach, chard, or another type of green, feel free to substitute!\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Ingredients](#ingredients)\n*   [Variations](#variations)\n*   [Recipe Step by Step Instructions](#recipe-step-by-step-instructions)\n*   [Recipe FAQs](#recipe-faqs)\n*   [Other Comfort Food Recipes to Consider](#other-comfort-food-recipes-to-consider)\n*   [Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet](#butternut-squash-chicken-sausage-and-kale-quinoa-skillet)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n![Ingredients in Butternut Squash Skillet including butternut squash, kale, quinoa, goat cheese, garlic, dried cherries, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, onion, and fresh sage. ](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Butternut-Squash-Quinoa-Skillet.jpg.webp)\n\n**Butternut Squash** \\- cubes of butternut squash are roasted and tossed into this quinoa dish.\n\n**Chicken Sausage** - I love using chicken sausage (Adell's is my favorite brand!) and in this dish I use apple chicken sausage.\n\n**Quinoa** - quinoa is a healthy grain that is a great source of fiber and protein. It's also the star in my [Mango Black Bean Quinoa Salad](https://greensnchocolate.com/mango-black-bean-quinoa-salad/).\n\n**Onion** - white or yellow onion both work in this recipe.\n\n**Garlic** - fresh garlic adds delicious flavor.\n\n**Fresh Sage** - I love adding fresh sage to fall dishes for an earthy flavor. I also love it in my [Garlic Herb Mayonnaise Roasted Turkey](https://greensnchocolate.com/garlic-herb-mayonnaise-roasted-turkey/) recipe!\n\n**Maple Syrup** - this is part of the very light sauce that adds some sweetness and warm flavor to the dish. It's not only used in sweet dishes like [Maple Muffins](https://greensnchocolate.com/maple-donut-muffins/)!\n\n**Dried Cherries** - cherries add a hint of sweetness and tartness. I love the texture they add, too.\n\n**Goat Cheese** - crumbles of creamy goat cheese make every bite a mouthful of flavor!\n\nSee recipe card for complete list of ingredients and quantities.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nThis recipe is absolutely delicious as is, but here are some variations.\n\n**Different greens** - If you prefer spinach, chard, or another type of green, you can easily swap out the kale.\n\n**Different squash** - You could use diced acorn squash, diced delicata squash, or diced sweet potato instead of butternut squash.\n\n**Different grain** - if you aren't a fan of quinoa or have something else on hand, feel free to swap it. Other ideas include wheat berries, brown rice, couscous, barley, and farro.\n\n**Different cheese** \\- you could use Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, or blue cheese instead of goat cheese.\n\n**Swap the fruit.** Instead of dried cherries, you can use dried cranberries or pomegranate arils. I think diced apples would also be delicious!\n\nRecipe Step by Step Instructions\n--------------------------------\n\n![](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blank-1200-x-600-52.png.webp)\n\n1.

A satisfying, veggie-filled and tasty breakfast.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-7-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### You may be wondering, what is a hash anyway?\n\nA hash is a dish of diced, ground or chopped meat and often times vegetables sautéed in a frying pan. We think it’s the perfect way to start the day when you’re in search of something savory, warm, satisfying, and hearty. Thanks to the well-balanced nature of this dish, it will keep your blood sugars stable all morning long, leaving you satisfied and ready to tackle the day.\n\nMaking a hash is also the perfect opportunity to ‘clean out the fridge’ and use up what you have on hand. But if you’re looking for more guidance we have some additional hash recipes for you to try including [Sweet Potato Hash with Bacon](https://therealfooddietitians.com/sweet-potato-hash-recipe/), [Tex Mex Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/tex-mex-sweet-potato-hash/), [Chicken Apple Sausage Sweet Potato Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/chicken-apple-sausage-sweet-potato-hash/), and [Brussels Sprouts Sweet Potato Sausage Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/brussels-sprouts-sweet-potato-sausage-hash/).\n\n#### Serve as an egg-free breakfast or if you wish, top with a fried egg.\n\nImagine your breakfast plate filled with tender butternut squash cubes, sweet apples and savory homemade sausage. While this Butternut Squash and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a satisfyingly scrumptious egg-free breakfast, a fried egg or two makes a nice addition for extra protein and staying power. Whatever you choose, we know you’re going to love this recipe! \n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-5-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Meal prep-friendly.\n\n[**Butternut Squash**](https://therealfooddietitians.com/butternut-squash-noodles-with-sausage-and-kale/) and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a great recipe for your weekend meal prep. It’s quick to make and reheats ever so nicely. Preparing this dish ahead of time, either from start to finish or simply pre-chopping your vegetables and cooking the sausage means you’ll spend less time in the kitchen during the busy work week.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-6-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Making your own sausage comes with benefits.\n\nUsing ground turkey (or chicken or pork) and a few dried spices from the pantry in place of store-bought breakfast sausage saves you money and means you’ll be getting less sodium and no preservatives. You know exactly what goes into the sausage when you make your own. The sausage is freezer-friendly so if you wish, you could double or triple the sausage portion of the recipe so that you can stock your freezer with some for future meals and recipes.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-8-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Not a kale lover? No problem.\n\nReplace the kale with spinach or chard or leave it out. It’s still incredibly delicious.\n\nGive this Butternut Squash and Apple Hash with Sausage a try!

Made with crisp apple slices, crunchy & sweet pomegranate seeds, and lots of greens paired with a homemade balsamic dressing. It’s the perfect salad to serve as a Thanksgiving side salad or to compliment your favorite fall meal!_ \n\n![A wooden bowl with apple pomegranate salad and a bed of greens in it. The bowl of salad is sitting on a wooden cutting board with a dark background behind it. With pomegranate seeds and a napkin arranged around the salad.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pomegranate-salad-2.jpg)\n\nIf you’ve never sprinkled sweet pomegranate seeds over a salad, then you are in for a treat! This is one of my favorite salads to make for fall and winter, and it’s always a crowd-pleaser.\n\nThis dish has a little bit of everything in it – lots of texture, sweet fruit taste, and leafy greens. You will fall in love with the flavors and find that it compliments almost any meal!\n\nIngredients You’ll Need\n-----------------------\n\nBelow you’ll find the full list of ingredients needed to make this salad happen!\n\n![Ingredients for apple pomegranate salad arranged on a brown wooden cutting board.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pomegranate-salad-ingredients.jpg)\n\n*   **Greens:** For the base of the salad I love using mixed greens, arugula, or kale! \n*   **Apples:** my favorite apples for salad are honey crisp, pink lady, or fuji!\n*   **Pomegranate seeds:** these sweet seeds add the perfect pop of flavor to the salad. \n*   **Nuts:** for the crunchy texture you can use chopped walnuts, pecans, almonds, or hazelnuts. \n*   **Oil:** for the salad dressing! I recommend using quality olive oil. \n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** a quality balsamic vinegar to flavor the salad dressing. \n*   **Honey:** to sweeten the salad dressing! You can also use maple syrup or coconut sugar. \n*   **Garlic powder:** this will add flavor to the salad dressing!\n*   **Cheese:** to add an extra level of flavor you can sprinkle feta or gorgonzola cheese over top!\n\n![A hand using a spoon to stir balsamic vinegar dressing in a liquid measuring cup.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/butternut-squash-salad-4.jpg)\n\nExtra Tips for Success\n----------------------\n\n*   **Make dairy-free:** This salad is delicious with feta or gorgonzola, but if you need it to be dairy-free you can leave the cheese out altogether. It’s just as delicious!\n*   **Make this salad ahead:** If this salad needs to be prepped ahead of time I recommend storing all the prepped ingredients in separate ziplock bags, then assembling the salad as needed close to the time of serving. \n*   **Add protein:** you can pair this salad with grilled chicken as a protein or for a plant-based option, try lentils or chickpeas.\n*   **More toppings to add:** some extra toppings you can add would be dried cranberries or cherries, roasted butternut squash, cooked wild rice for heartiness, or sliced pears!\n*   **A tip if using kale:** I usually blend the base of this salad with kale and arugula. But if you dislike the texture of kale my best tip would be to chop it really small. It blends right in with the arugula, and no one ever notices!\n\n![A close up of apple pomegranate salad in a bed of greens in a wooden bowl. ](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/apple-pomegranate-salad.jpg)\n\nWhat to Pair it With\n--------------------\n\nThis salad goes perfectly with just about any meal! But some of my favorite meals to serve it with are alongside this [lemon rosemary chicken and potatoes](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/easy-lemon-rosemary-skillet-chicken/), [air fryer turkey breast](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/maple-herb-air-fryer-turkey-breast/), or this [autumn chicken and butternut squash skillet](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/autumn-roasted-chicken-and-butternut-squash-skillet/).\n\nOther Delicious Salad Recipes to Enjoy\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   [Mediterranean Chickpea Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/mediterranean-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [Tuscan-Style Panzanella Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/tuscan-style-panzanella-salad/)\n*   [Autumn Kale & Roasted Butternut Squash Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/autumn-kale-butternut-squash-salad/)\n*   [Pear and Gorgonzola Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/pear-salad-with-gorgonzola-hazelnuts/)\n\nApple Pomegranate Salad\n-----------------------\n\nThe whole family will love this amazing pomegranate salad!

The opinions and text are all mine._\n\nDoes the cold weather make you just crave comfort food?  I know it does that to me.  And although I have plenty of room on my meal plan for [warm soups](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/), [cheesy pasta](https://www.foxandbriar.com/one-pot-pasta-bake-sausage-wine/) and all other kinds of comfort food, sometimes I want to keep it healthier and focus on fruits and veggies.  As I shared before with my [Roasted Shrimp, Fennel and Grapefruit Kale Salad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/roasted-shrimp-fennel-and-grapefruit-kale-salad/), I like my cool weather salads to be bulked up with roasted veggies and grains.  Here I have kept the farro and kale, but added roasted delicata squash and pomegranate aerials for that sweet tart zing.  Once again, my local Fred Meyer came through for me by having all the ingredients I needed for this salad, including these gorgeous pomegranates.\n\n[Jump to recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/autumn-harvest-salad-with-pomegranates/#recipe)\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

Then it is all tossed together with a maple apple cider vinaigrette! #ad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Autmumn-Harvest-Salad-with-Pomegranates-4-of-17.jpg)\n\nHow to de-seed a pomegranate:\n-----------------------------\n\n1.  1.  This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

    "markdown": "# Chipotle Chicken Skewers\nA gourmet dish that's fit for the grill!\n\n![These cipotle honey chicken skewers are a wonderful way to enjoy a delicious and nutritious dinner!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-1-1200x799.jpg)\n\nDoes this sound familiar? You’ve just invited friends and family to a cookout at your place next weekend, but now you’ve found yourself at a bit of a loss for what to feed them! Hamburgers and hotdogs? Been there, done that. The routine BBQ Chicken that always seems to get scorched on the outside while it’s undercooked on the inside. Umm…maybe not.\n\nHow about adding a surprising gourmet touch that will make you famous for your skills at the grill, but it’s so simple you won’t even break a sweat? Sound good? If so, our Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers are the perfect option!\n\nThese skewers are everything you’re looking for in a backyard-friendly grilling dish. Our recipe offers a blend of enticing flavors, clean eating ingredients, and an unexpected taste that will have your guests asking, “What’s in this?” Well, the answer is healthy flavor– and _a lot of it._ \n\n**What Ingredients Do I Need?**\n-------------------------------\n\n![These flavorful chipotle honey chicken skewers will be the star of your cookout!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-6-e1629296144774.jpg)\n\nFirst, you’ll need some chicken! We suggest using boneless, skinless chicken breasts for their low fat and high protein content. Then, whisk together some honey for natural sweetness, tomato paste and apple cider vinegar for a tangy bite, chipotle chili powder for some heat, and garlic for a rich, savory finish. Each ingredient is healthy, and when combined in a sauce, the flavors complement one another perfectly. Oh, and did we mention it’s EASY?\n\n**Making These Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![Grill up some chicken skewers instead of plain old hamburgers and hotdogs. ](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-5-e1629296192708.jpg)\n\nThe preparation process for these honey chipotle chicken skewers is incredibly simple. So simple, in fact, that they can be on the table in less than 30 minutes! Start by slicing your chicken breasts into very thin strips using your sharpest knife. Once all of the slices are ready, begin threading them, accordion-style, onto the wooden skewers that you’ve soaked in some water beforehand (so they don’t burn through). This recipe is for eight skewers, so you should aim to get about four ounces of uncooked chicken onto each one.\n\n[![](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Skinny-Ms-Graphics-Horizontal-728-x-450-px-2.png)](https://bundles.skinnyms.com/?utm_source=skinnyms&utm_medium=inpostbanner)\n\nSet your skewered chicken to the side while you make the chipotle honey sauce. Grab a small bowl and whisk together the honey, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, chipotle chili powder, chopped garlic, and optional salt. Spoon the sauce evenly over the skewers. Alternatively, you can make the sauce in advance and marinate your sliced chicken in it for 30 minutes or longer before threading the strips on your skewers. Either way, make sure to save some of the sauce for basting during the grilling process.\n\nYour uncooked chicken skewers can rest in the fridge (covered with plastic or foil) while you’re preparing your side dishes. That way, you can throw them on the grill right before dinner time so they’re fresh and hot off the grill! When you’re ready, add the skewers to a hot grill for 10 to 12 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. Throughout the grilling process, baste the chicken with sauce, turning the skewers every 2 to 3 minutes. This will ensure the chicken is evenly cooked.\n\nIf the rain clouds come out and you’re forced to move inside, away from the grill, you’ll be glad to know that this recipe can also be prepared in the oven. Preheat it to 400 degrees. Cook them for 16-18 minutes or until fully cooked, rotating and basting every 5 or 6 minutes. If you like a little crisp on your sauced chicken, turn the broiler on and broil them for a minute or two once they are cooked, but be careful not to burn!\n\n**What Side Dishes Go With These Chicken Skewers?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Our quick and easy southwest cucumber avocado salad is a must-make this Summer!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Quick-and-Easy-Southwest-Cucumber-Avocado-Salad-8-e1606794206790.jpg)](https://skinnyms.com/quick-and-easy-southwest-cucumber-avocado-salad/)\n\nOur honey chipotle chicken skewers will no doubt be the star of the dinner plate, but every star needs a supporting actor (or two!).

A Thanksgiving dinner (or really any dinner) side dish winner!\n\n![A bowl of sautéed maple bacon Brussels sprouts on a marble table.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-1.jpg)\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Ingredients](#ingredients)\n*   [How to Cut Brussels Sprouts](#how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts)\n*   [How to Make Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts](#how-to-make-maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts)\n*   [Chef’s Tips](#chefs-tips)\n*   [What’s the Easiest Way to Cut Bacon?](#whats-the-easiest-way-to-cut-bacon)\n*   [Can I Make This Recipe in Advance?](#can-i-make-this-recipe-in-advance)\n*   [Recipe](#recipe)\n\nBacon and brussels sprouts and maple syrup and bourbon, oh my!\n\nThese are most definitely a few of my favorite things. And if you’re reading this post, they’re probably some of yours too, which means we can totally be friends. A friend who shares her bacon is a friend for life. BFFs = Bacon. Friends. _Forevah_.\n\nBrussels sprouts are sort of a culinary line in the sand, right? If you love them, you really _really_ love ’em. You love crispy [Brussels sprouts in the air fryer](https://oursaltykitchen.com/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts/) and [shredded Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/shredded-brussels-sprouts/) in the oven. You love them raw in a salad, and you definitely wouldn’t turn your nose up at [Christmas Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/pan-roasted-brussels-sprouts-cranberries-pistachios/) with pistachios and cranberries.\n\nAnd if you don’t? Well, **you just might need bacon and bourbon to make ’em palatable**. And you’re in luck!\n\nMaple bacon Brussels sprouts are both sweet and savory; crunchy and tender; and oh so very pretty to look at. The best part? This recipe is really easy to make – even for beginners!\n\n![The ingredients for maple bacon Brussels sprouts arranged on a marble table - brussels sprouts, diced bacon, chopped pecans, bourbon, mustard powder, and maple syrup.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-4.jpeg)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   **Brussels Sprouts:** choose the freshest sprouts you can find. In their peak season, you can often find Brussels sprouts still attached to the stalk. Those are great! But they’re not essential. For the freshest Brussels sprouts, look for bright green sprouts with firmly packed leaves that aren’t yellow or withering. Avoid sprouts that are cracked or have too many black spots.\n*   **Bacon:** both regular and thick cut bacon work.\n*   **Pecans:** use raw, unsalted pecans. Coarsely chop them, or buy “pecan pieces”. If you don’t like pecans, walnuts are a nice substitute.\n*   **Ground (Dry) Mustard:** dry mustard is just ground up mustard seeds. On its own, it’s essentially flavorless, but once it’s “activated” by a liquid (in this recipe, bourbon) it bring a pleasant pungency and a bit of acidity to the dish.\n*   **Bourbon:** bourbon is used to deglaze the pan, and lends a smoky flavor. But more importantly, bourbon is slightly acidic! This is important, as the acidity will neutralize the sulfuric odors released during the cooking process (those orders, and resulting flavor, are why some find Brussels sprouts so off-putting. Neutralize it for clean, rich flavor!).\n*   **Maple Syrup:** our sweet foil! Opposites attract, and here we have a few. Maple syrup will balance out the saltiness in the bacon, the pungency of the mustard, and the acidity of the bourbon. It’s a must, so don’t skip!\n\n**BOURBON SUBSTITUTION:** If you don’t consume alcohol, or don’t want to use bourbon, replace it with two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.\n\nHow to Cut Brussels Sprouts\n---------------------------\n\nBefore you even get started, be sure to use sprouts that are (roughly) the same size – this way they’ll cook evenly, at the same rate! The only thing worse than a mushy sprout is an undercooked sprout, and uniformity from the start will make the job that much easier. \n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the ends trimmed.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-1.jpg)\n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the outer leaves peeled off.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n![Side view, trimmed and peeled Brussels sprouts sliced in half on a cutting board.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-3.jpg)\n\n1.  Use sharp paring knife to **trim off the root end** of each sprout.\n2.  **Peel away any withered or yellowed leaves.** If your Brussels sprouts are very fresh you should only need to remove the outer layer.\n3.  **Slice each sprout in half lengthwise**, from top to bottom. This cut allows the densely packed leaves to cook through all the way to the center.\n\nHow to Make Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts\n----------------------------------------\n\nWith maple syrup, bacon, and pecans, this Brussels sprouts recipe has a little something for everyone. Start by blanching the Brussels sprouts in salted water, then finish them on the stove – this method creates tender interiors and crisp edges. The bourbon is optional, but recommended. You can substitute for apple cider vinegar if you don’t cook with alcohol.\n\n![Side view, bacon Brussels sprouts tossed with maple syrup and pecans in a white bowl with a wood spoon.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n1.  **Blanch the Brussels sprouts** in salted water. Cook 4-5 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender but still bright green. They’re ready once you can easily piece the stem using the tip of a knife.\n2.  **Strain the sprouts**, then run them under **cool running water or plunge into an ice bath** to stop the cooking process. Shake well, **then air dry** on a kitchen towel to remove any clinging water droplets.\n3.  **Cook the bacon in a 12″ skillet** over medium heat until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, then **remove the bacon pieces** using a slotted spoon.\n4.  Increase the heat to medium high and **add the Brussels sprouts and pecans** to the rendered bacon fat; **saute** until the edges of the sprouts are crisp, about 5 minutes.\n5.  **Sprinkle the ground mustard** over the sprouts and pecans and cook 1-2 minutes more.\n6.  **Deglaze the pan with the bourbon**, stirring constantly until its completely absorbed.\n7.  **Pour in the maple syrup** and cook 1 minute more, or until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve right away. Enjoy!\n\nChef’s Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Use **real maple syrup**, not pancake syrup, for pure maple flavor.\n*   **Swap pecans for walnuts**, or simply omit them.\n*   **Don’t overcook the Brussels sprouts when blanching!** Drain them when they’re still bright green, after 4-5 minutes.\n*   Season the water with **plenty of kosher salt** – about a tablespoon; it will infuse the Brussels sprouts with flavor from the inside out.\n*   Use a **large, 12″ skillet.** This allows the Brussels sprouts to make lots of contact with the surface for crispier edges.\n*   **Wait to season with salt and pepper** until the end – you may need just a pinch of salt, or none at all.\n\nWhat’s the Easiest Way to Cut Bacon?\n------------------------------------\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to slice bacon with a chef’s knife, it’s sort of a cumbersome process. Use kitchen shears instead! It makes for quick, efficient work.\n\nCan I Make This Recipe in Advance?\n----------------------------------\n\nYes, maple bacon Brussels sprouts are partially make ahead friendly!\n\nBlanch the Brussels sprouts, then plunge them into an ice bath. Drain, then store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Cook in the skillet as directed 15-20 minutes before you’re ready to serve.\n\n![A bowl of maple bacon Brussels sprouts on a marble table with a wood spoon and cream linen napkin to the side.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-3.jpeg)\n\n**Did you make these Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts?

Bring the water to a boil and season with the kosher salt. Add the brussels sprouts to the boil water and give them a good stir. Boil 4-5 minutes, until the sprouts are tender but still bright green in color. Drain in a colander, run under cold water to stop the cooking process, then lay on a kitchen towel to dry.\n    \n*   Place the bacon in a 12\" skillet and heat over medium heat. Saute, stirring occassionally, until the fat renders and bacon is crisp, 7-8 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and place onto a paper-towel lined plate to drain.\n    \n*   Increase the heat to medium high, then add the blanched Brussels sprouts and pecans to the rendered bacon fat. Saute over high heat, stirring frequently, until the sprouts are crisp, 4-5 minutes.\n    \n*   Sprinkle the mustard powder over the sprouts and pecans, then stir constantly for 1 minute. Pour the bourbon (or cider vinegar) into the pan to deglaze; stir and scrape constantly until any browned bits have been scraped up and the bourbon is completely absorbed, 2-3 minutes.\n    \n*   Add the bacon back to the pan, then pour in the maple syrup. Give everything a good toss, then cook 1 minute more, until the syrup is slightly thickened. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper if needed. Serve right away, and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Make Ahead Instructions**\n\nAfter you’ve blanched the Brussels sprouts, drain them well, then spread onto a paper towel or kitchen towel to thoroughly dry. Place them into a sealed container or ziplock bag and place into the fridge, where they’ll keep for about 24 hours. When you’re ready to serve, start with Step 2. The blanched Brussels sprouts can go straight from the fridge to the pan.\n\nServing: 4oz, Calories: 175kcal (9%), Carbohydrates: 18g (6%), Protein: 6g (12%), Fat: 8g (12%), Saturated Fat: 1g (5%), Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g, Monounsaturated Fat: 1g, Trans Fat: 0g, Cholesterol: 5mg (2%), Sodium: 318mg (13%), Potassium: 389mg (11%), Fiber: 3g (12%), Sugar: 2g (2%), Vitamin A: 18% (18%), Vitamin C: 117% (117%), Calcium: 7% (7%), Iron: 8% (8%)\n\n_**Disclaimer:** This post and the recipe card may contain affiliate links, which means we receive a small commission (at no cost to you!) if you make a purchase using these links.

Potato ‘french’ fries are a staple pretty much everywhere, and with good reason, with that crispy outside and silky smooth inside, they are simply irresistible! Sweet potato fries are becoming more popular these days and carrot fries are just as good! Carrots are pretty easy to turn into fries, you just need to get some large ones, peel them and slice them into sticks before frying them! Of course you can deep fry them, and they are amazing deep fried, but you can also roast them, which keeps them a little lighter. When I roast carrot fries I like to season them with salt and pepper and hit of parmesan cheese adds a huge amount of flavour! In addition to just tasting amazing, the parmesan also melts onto the carrot fries and caramelizes getting all nice and crispy and good making the fries even crispier! Carrots are sweet so I like to serve them with a spicy dipping sauce like chipotle mayo or a gochujang ketchup and they are the perfect side for pretty much any meal, especially an Easter dinner!\n\n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004604-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004614-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004566-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004592-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004603-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")\n\n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004575-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")\n\n#### Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\n\n**Prep Time**: 10 minutes **Cook Time**: 20 minutes **Total Time**: 30 minutes **Servings**: 6\n\nSweet roasted carrot fries covered with crispy parmesan cheese!\n\n##### ingredients\n\n*   2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4 in thick ‘fries’\n*   1 tablespoon oil\n*   salt and pepper to taste\n*   1/2 cup parmigiano reggiano (parmesan cheese), grated\n\n##### directions\n\n1.

Chicken tenderloins, baby carrots and gold potatoes are cooked to perfection in a homemade garlic butter sauce.\n\nIf you love easy chicken recipes, try my [slow cooker chicken stew](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-chicken-stew/) recipe and [slow cooker cranberry chicken](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-cranberry-chicken/) recipes.\n\n![chicken with potatoes and carrots in crockpot.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-5.jpg)\n\n \n\nWhy this recipe works\n---------------------\n\nThis recipe isn’t for the faint of heart, this is for my butter loving friends. A stick of butter flavors this meal, but the entire meal. I add garlic, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper to a stick of melted butter. I pour that garlic butter mixture over chicken, carrots, and wedges of Yukon gold potatoes.\n\nNot all slow cooker meals end up being complete meals; I usually have to make a starchy side or make a salad. With this recipe, all the main food groups are covered. The chicken is tender, and so are the veggies. My favorite thing about this meal is the potatoes. There is something about butter and potatoes together that just can’t be beaten. I hope you give this recipe a try! It’s hearty like a pot roast dinner, but with chicken instead. Have a great week. I’ll be back at the end of the week with another recipe.\n\nRecipe Ingredients\n------------------\n\n![Ingredients for garlic butter chicken and vegetables on table.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-ingredients-2.jpg)\n\n*   **Chicken tenderloins** – These cook up perfectly and soak up the garlic butter. You can use boneless skinless chicken breasts if that’s all you have.\n*   **Carrots** – Use one pound of baby carrots or one pound of carrots cut into 1 inch chunks.\n*   **Gold Potatoes** – You can use red or gold potatoes, but we LOVE gold potatoes in this recipe.\n*   **Garlic Butter Sauce** – Salted butter, fresh minced garlic, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper.\n\nStep-by-Step Directions\n-----------------------\n\n![4 steps on how to add chicken, vegetables and garlic butter sauce to slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-collage-1-1200x1200.jpg)\n\n**Step One** – In a small bowl, add the melted salted butter and add minced garlic, salt, pepper, dried thyme, and dried parsley.\n\n**Step Two** –   Place chicken tenders (or breasts) in the middle of the slow cooker. On one side of that place wedges of Yukon gold potatoes and on the other a bag of baby carrots.\n\n**Step Three** – Pour the garlic butter mixture over the chicken and veggies.\n\n**Step Four** – Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours. Serve and enjoy! Plenty of buttery sauce for everyone!\n\n![cooked garlic butter chicken in slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-2.jpg)\n\nVariations\n----------\n\n*   **Green beans** – Green beans cook up so well in the slow cooker, use them instead of the carrots for this garlic butter chicken recipe.\n*   **Easy Peasy** – Instead of making a garlic butter sauce. Use 2/3 cup of Italian dressing.\n*   **Lemon Chicken** – Add the juice of one large lemon to the garlic butter sauce. You can even add the zest of that lemon too.\n*   **Parmesan** – To make the flavor pop in this dish, sprinkle grated parmesan cheese on each individual serving.\n\n![over head shot of plate of chicken, potatoes and vegetables.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-3.jpg)\n\nRecipe FAQs\n-----------\n\n**Can I use olive oil instead of butter?**\n\nOlive oil can be used instead of butter if you are in pinch, though you won’t get as much flavor.\n\n**Can I use chicken broth instead of butter?**\n\nIf you are looking to make this a healthy meal you can use chicken broth instead of butter, or water and a chicken bouillon cube.\n\n**Can I use Italian Seasoning?**\n\nYes! You can use 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning instead of the parsley and thyme.  \n\n**Can I use chicken thighs?**\n\nYes, chicken thighs are a great choice for this recipe. Though, be sure to trim them well.\n\n![chicken tenderloins on plate with carrots and potatoes.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-4.jpg)\n\n**Want to make more magic in your crockpot?** Stay up to date and subscribe to my [**newsletter**](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-secrets/) and follow along on [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/TheMagicalSlowCooker/), [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/themagicalslowcooker/), **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/magicalslowcook/)**, [**Tik Tok**](https://www.tiktok.com/@magicalslowcooker), and [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheMagicalSlowCooker).\n\n![close up of garlic butter chicken and veggies in slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-1-3-300x300.jpg)\n\n*   ▢\n\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken tenders boneless skinless chicken breasts will work fine too\n*   ▢ 1 lb. bag baby carrots\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 lbs.

But, if you’re a fan of a creamy pasta salad, or an ultra easy-to-make pasta salad that’s loaded with healthier goodness (plus bacon!), this avocado and bacon pasta salad is for you.\n\nOnce the garden tomatoes come into harvest, BLT sandwiches are a staple at our house. And the only thing that makes them even better is adding avocado for them to become BLATs. Bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato sandwiches that are now a BBQ pasta salad staple.\n\nSo when my daughter requested I make a pasta salad that included her beloved bacon in the BLT mix, avocado was an obvious addition to make.\n\n[![BLT pasta salad ingredients in glass bowl](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1.jpg)\n\nBLT Pasta Salad Ingredients\n---------------------------\n\nI’m sure you can already guess the key ingredients in this BLT pasta salad recipe, but I added in a few more veggies to add extra pops of flavor. Instead of lettuce, I used peppery arugula, which pairs beautifully with the ranch pasta salad dressing. And I prefer using cherry tomatoes in this BLT pasta salad because they’re so juicy and hold their shape nicely.\n\nThe other ingredients you’ll need for this potluck side dish are:\n\n*   Pasta\n*   Bacon\n*   Cherry tomatoes\n*   Arugula\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Greek yogurt\n*   Mayonnaise\n*   White vinegar\n*   Chives\n*   Parsley\n*   Garlic powder\n*   Salt and pepper\n\nThe pasta salad dressing is a little healthier, because I used Greek yogurt instead of full flavored mayonnaise and sour cream. But thanks to the fresh herbs it has a totally fresh and delicious flavor.\n\nAs with any cold pasta salad, taste the dressing after you’ve whisked it together to see if it needs more salt or pepper. It’s much easier to season the dressing before it’s been tossed with the pasta!\n\n[![container of greek yogurt next to sliced red onion on counter](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002.jpg)\n\nHow to Make BLT Pasta Salad\n---------------------------\n\nTo make this homemade pasta salad, you’ll first need to cook the pasta noodles according to the package’s instructions. I tend to undercook my pasta just a bit for pasta salads so it doesn’t turn to mush as it absorbs the salad dressing.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, dice the bacon and cook it until it reaches your desired level of crispness. Note that you won’t have to oil the pan before cooking the bacon in it as the bacon will release a good amount of fat as it cooks.\n\nOnce the pasta has cooled slightly and the bacon and veggies have been prepped, add everything to a large bowl and toss to combine.\n\nNext up is the dressing. This pasta salad dressing is so easy to make, and is an easier rendition of [my homemade Ranch dressing](https://www.foodiecrush.com/homemade-ranch-dressing-recipe/) for saucing this easy pasta salad. In a separate bowl, whisk together the homemade ranch dressing. Pour the dressing over the BLT pasta salad and gently stir to distribute it.\n\n[![Homemade Ranch Dressing Recipe | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)\n\nCan I Use Fat-Free Greek Yogurt?\n--------------------------------\n\nPersonally, I would steer clear of using fat-free yogurt in this homemade pasta salad. Fat-free yogurts are often loaded with additives to make up for their flavor, and have a tendency to separate. Stick to low-fat or whole milk plain Greek yogurt for this recipe.\n\nThe Best Pastas for Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nI like this pasta salad best with a short pasta noodle, and like in my [Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/)  I use my favorite shell noodle. But, there are quite a few other types you can try, like:\n\n*   Farfalle (bowtie or butterflies)\n*   Gemelli (twists)\n*   Fusilli (springs)\n*   Campanelle (flowers)\n*   Penne (tubes)\n*   Orichette (ears)\n\nAlways cook your pasta in water that’s been generously salted. I always prefer kosher salt to regular table or iodized salt because it’s not as harsh due to its larger, flakier crystals.\n\n[![BLT Pasta Salad with Avocado | foodiecrush.com #pasta #salad #BLT #bacon #tomato #avocado #recipes](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013.jpg)\n\nCan I Prep This Pasta Salad in Advance?\n---------------------------------------\n\nI actually prefer my pasta salads to be served chilled, so yes, you can definitely prep this bacon pasta salad in advance. Just note that the longer the bacon sits in the dressing, the less crisp it will be when you serve this pasta salad.\n\nWith that said, this BLT pasta salad will be fine if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to serving it. This will give the flavors time to come together.\n\nCan I Double This BLT Pasta Salad Recipe?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re making this pasta salad for a backyard BBQ or potluck party, you can easily double the recipe if you’ll be feeding a _lot_ of people. One pound of pasta makes a lot of pasta salad, and the salad as-is serves 12 or more, but will stretch further if you’re serving other salads or side dishes along with it.\n\n[![close up of avocado and bacon pasta salad](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009.jpg)\n\nTips for Making BLT Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you’re out of ingredients or out of time to make the easy homemade dressing, feel free to use a quality bottled ranch dressing instead.\n\nWe prefer using classic pork bacon to make this BLT pasta salad, but you’re welcome to use any type of bacon you’d like.\n\nOne final note: the sliced avocado will brown as it sits in this BLT pasta salad. Personally, I don’t mind eating brown avocado (it’s perfectly safe to eat!), but if that’s something you’re worried about you can wait to stir it in until just before you serve this homemade pasta salad.\n\nMore Pasta Salad Ideas to Try\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Classic Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/) (this one always gets raves)\n*   [Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto](https://www.foodiecrush.com/craving-5-recipes-for-creamy-macaroni-salad/ \"Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto\")\n*   [Easy Italian Spaghetti Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/easy-italian-spaghetti-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Creamy Tuscan Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/tuscan-pasta-salad/)\n*   [How to Make Classic Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-classic-macaroni-salad/) (because classics always win!)\n*   [Kale Caesar Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/kale-caesar-pasta-salad/ \"Kale Caesar Pasta Salad\")\n*   [Greek Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/greek-pasta-salad-cucumbers-artichoke-hearts/)\n\n**If you mak****e this recipe, please let me know!

Tender chicken is tossed in a spicy and creamy roasted tomatillo sauce for a flavor kick!_\n\n![Healthy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wholesome-chicken-tomatillo-and-quinoa-black-bean-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhen you go to your favorite Mexican restaurant are you a red sauce or green sauce fan? I used to be all about the earthy creamy red sauce poured on top of burritos, enchiladas or stewed meat. Then one day I had a change of heart when I had the most incredible plate of pork Chile Verde. I’ve been itching to learn how to make tomatillo sauce that could I use for just about any meal.\n\nToday I’m sharing a healthy chicken tomatillo bowl! You will learn how to make the sauce from scratch paired with a creamy, and spicy chicken topped on a bed of [cooked quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/). I will leave the rest of the extra toppings up to you, but at least you’ll have the essential recipe.\n\n![a sheet pan filled with green tomatillos](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fresh-tomatillos-onions-pasilla-chilis-garlic-for-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhat are Tomatillos?\n--------------------\n\nYou may have seen them hanging out next to the hot peppers in the produce aisle, but have you dared to cook with them? To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first, but I gave it a shot. Here are the basics of using tomatillos in cooking.\n\n*   Tomatillos are a member of the nightshade family. They are wrapped in a wrinkly paper husk, and once you remove the outer layer a gorgeous candy-apple green colored fruit appears. You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.\n*   Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.\n*   To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.\n\n![making green salsa with peppers and onions](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/oven-roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nThe base for the tomatillo sauce is, of course, the green fruit to add it’s characteristic tangy flavor, jalapeno, and pasilla (or poblano) peppers for heat, caramelized purple onions for sweetness and buttery roasted garlic for earthiness.\n\nCheck out how all of the fruit, vegetables, and aromatics just melt together in the pan after roasting. So many incredible flavors in one place, divine!\n\n![side by side before and after photos of sauce ingredients from solid to puree](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-before-and-after-blending-600x450.jpg)\n\nNow it’s time to bring the sauce components together! Chicken broth and fresh parsley are added to the roasted ingredients, then pureed in my Vitamix Blender until smooth.\n\nSo the first taste I took off the tomatillo salsa, it was SPICY! If you want more of a mild sauce, remove the seeds and inner membranes of the jalapenos and pasilla peppers before roasting. Or even add just one jalapeno instead of two. However once I added some yogurt to the sauce, that helped bring down the heat. This recipe makes a lot of sauce so that you can use it for another meal like [enchiladas](https://www.jessicagavin.com/chicken-enchiladas-with-pumpkin-sauce/), or even as a salsa with some crunchy chips!\n\n![chicken breasts being seared in a pan](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/spiced-sauteed-chicken-breast-600x900.jpg)\n\nLet’s talk POLLO. For the shredded chicken, I like to add a generous amount of spices for flavor, and a short [saute](https://www.jessicagavin.com/sauteing/) so that the chicken stays nice and juicy. You can bake, or poach the chicken, but I like the flavors developed on the surface from the sear with the sauteed chicken. If you are in a pinch for time, grab a roasted chicken from the store and shred away.\n\n![spoon mixing green sauce with shredded chicken](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/creamy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-1-600x900.jpg)\n\nOh yea, check out this creamy green goodness! The spicy tomatillo sauce gets combined with just a touch of plain Greek yogurt to add a creamy texture to each bite. The yogurt also helps to back the heat a bit, but it’s still got a nice kick! The sauce and the chicken get tossed together, and it’s ready for bowl customization.\n\n![top down view of two bowls of chicken tomatillo served on top of quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healthy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-bowls-with-quinoa-600x900.jpg)\n\nIt’s topping time! I like a balance of textures and making sure I get a variety of colors for extra nutritional benefits. I add sliced radishes, limes, chopped red onions, black beans, diced avocado and tomatoes to the bowl. The additional protein, fiber, and phytonutrients make this a healthy meal that you will crave!\n\n![close of up a chicken quinoa bowl](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-tomatillo-chicken-and-quinoa-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nGrab a fork and let’s dig in! If you are having guests over you can create a build-your-own chicken bowl bar and put out different toppings and even have brown rice or vegetable noodles to fill. What other tasty dishes would you add the tomatillo sauce? I would love to hear so I can try!\n\nHow do you pick ripe tomatillos?\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen tomatillos are ripe, they are juicy, firm and tart. A few guidelines when you are at the market to pick ripe tomatillos are go for smaller sizes. They tend to be a little sweeter. Slightly peel back the husk and look for bright green colored fruit. This will yield a more tangy fruit which is what you want in your dish. Pale yellow or light green tomatillo will be overripe but less tart. Touch the outside of the husk and look for it to be sticky and not dry and the fruit should fill most of the husk. Pick firm tomatillos, if it’s too soft, it’s past it’s prime.\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   ▢ 20 tomatillos\n*   ▢ 2 jalapeño peppers, stems removed\n*   ▢ 3 pasilla chilies, or poblanos, stems removed\n*   ▢ ½ red onion, cut in half\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole\n*   ▢ 1 cup unsalted chicken broth, or stock\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, packed\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons nonfat plain Greek yogurt, or lowfat sour cream\n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup quinoa\n*   ▢ 2 cups water\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to ¾-inch thick\n*   ▢ black pepper\n*   ▢ [paprika](https://www.jessicagavin.com/what-is-paprika/)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 425°F. Remove the paper off of the tomatillos and place them on a large baking pan. Add jalapeño peppers, pasilla chilies and cut red onion to the same pan.\n    \n*   Drizzle the chilies with one tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n    \n*   Place the peeled garlic in foil, lightly drizzle with oil and wrap into a packet that is open from the top, place on the corner of the baking pan. Roast chilies, onion, and garlic for 40 minutes stirring chilies after 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa and chicken.\n    \n*   Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.\n    \n*   Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.\n    \n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   Add 1 cup quinoa to a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse well with running water. Transfer to a pot with lid. Add 2 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt.\n    \n*   Bring to a boil, put a lid on then reduce to a simmer, over medium-low heat. Allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until water is absorbed, then turn off the heat. Allow it to sit with the lid on for at least 5 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork when ready to serve.\n    \n*   Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side, or until chicken is no longer pink. Transfer to a clean plate.\n    \n*   Once slightly cooled shred chicken into smaller pieces. Transfer to the saute pan that has 2 cups of tomatillo sauce. Turn heat to medium and warm chicken and sauce until hot. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons yogurt. Taste season with more salt and pepper as desired.\n    \n*   Assemble bowls with quinoa, add tomatillo chicken and other desired toppings.\n    \n\n*   **Additional Topping Suggestions**: Sliced limes, radishes, cilantro, diced onion, tomatoes, black beans, sour cream, and avocado.\n\nCalories 320kcal (16%)Carbohydrates 29g (10%)Protein 27g (54%)Fat 12g (18%)Saturated Fat 2g (10%)Polyunsaturated Fat 2gMonounsaturated Fat 7gCholesterol 71mg (24%)Sodium 1122mg (47%)Potassium 542mg (15%)Fiber 4g (16%)Sugar 5g (6%)Vitamin A 250IU (5%)Vitamin C 37.1mg (45%)Calcium 30mg (3%)Iron 3.4mg (19%)\n\nPercent Daily Values are based on a 2000-calorie diet.

Our pasta salad dressing has only five ingredients, including salt and pepper.\n\nTo make the pasta salad dressing, whisk white wine vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, Italian seasoning, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This dressing is pretty simple, but when mixed with pasta, chicken, tomato, avocado, and other ingredients, the flavor is amazing!\n\nTo customize your pasta salad dressing, add a tablespoon of Greek yogurt, or use apple cider vinegar for a milder taste.\n\n![chicken salad dressing recipe](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chicken-salad-dressing-recipe.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![pasta salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pasta-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![best salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n**How to make chicken pasta salad:**\n\n**1.** Add the shredded chicken, pasta, onion, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and basil in a large bowl.\n\n**2.** In a jar, combine the ingredients for the dressing: vinegar, Italian seasoning, Olive oil, salt and pepper.\n\n**3.** Drizzle your chicken pasta salad with the dressing. Toss gently until all the ingredients are combined. Serve the **chicken pasta salad** immediately, or chill for later. Enjoy! ❤️\n\n![Chicken Pasta Salad recipe 3](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chicken-Pasta-Salad-recipe-3.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nTips for the chicken pasta salad\n--------------------------------\n\nThis **chicken pasta salad** is healthy, perfect for busy nights, and makes a big enough batch so you can plan for work or school lunches. Since there’s no mayo it’s great for potlucks, picnics, and parties.\n\n*   Additional add-ins that go well with this salad would include chopped cucumber, crispy bacon, corn, olives, black beans…\n*   To keep the avocado from turning brown, coat the avocado in either lemon juice or lime juice. It will act as an antioxidant.\n*   Being a **cold chicken pasta salad** makes it perfect for summer, picnics or potlucks. You can make it up to a day in advance, leaving the avocado and tomato until you are ready to serve the chicken pasta salad to keep the ingredients as fresh as possible.\n\n### Can I grill chicken instead of using rotisserie chicken?\n\nYes, of course, you can **grill chicken for this salad**. Make sure to grill chicken breasts or pan-sear on medium-low heat, so chicken doesn’t burn while undercooked in the inside. When out of fresh chicken, we like to use a bag of frozen grilled organic chicken breasts that we heat up in a skillet and use for the salad.\n\n### How to Store the Chicken Pasta Salad?\n\nThis chicken pasta salad keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days if stored in an air-tight container. Don’t keep it for more than that because the avocado will turn brown. You may have to toss the chicken pasta salad leftovers to redistribute the dressing before serving. If you want to make it ahead of time, omit the avocado, you’ll add them at the very last minute.\n\n### What other readers say about this chicken pasta salad\n\n“This was so good and the perfect lunch. Changes: I added black olives, cucumber and matchstick carrots. I forgot to add the basil and it was fine without it.” – Maureen\n\n“Just made this chicken pasta salad for our dinner. Will definitely make it again. Perfect for summer. Added some fire roasted corn and served the dressing on the side with croutons.” – Nancy\n\n“Delicious! Husband loved it! Will be making it again!” – Laura\n\n“The boys ate three plates each, this salad is a keeper!” – Deja\n\n“Easy, healthy and cheap recipe; delicious!

    "markdown": "# Grilled chicken BLT salad - Simply Delicious\nJuicy grilled **chicken BLT salad** is everything you want from a salad and more. Crispy bacon, creamy avocado and punchy lemon-herb dressing all come together to make this salad recipe simply irresistible.\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad with avocado](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-3.jpg)\n\nIngredients needed\n------------------\n\n*   **Chicken.** I used boneless skinless chicken breasts but boneless chicken thighs will be delicious too. I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper.\n*   **Bacon.** I used streaky bacon.\n*   **Lettuce.** Use your favorite crisp lettuce. Romaine lettuce, Cos, etc.\n*   **Tomatoes.** Cherry tomatoes, baby tomatoes, baby plum tomatoes will all work.\n*   **Avocado.**\n*   **For the dressing:** Extra-virgin olive oil, dried oregano, fresh lemon juice, salt and black pepper.\n\nHow to make BLT salad\n---------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** Halve the chicken horizontally with a sharp knife then place in a medium bowl. Mix together the marinade ingredients and pour over the chicken. Toss to coat then allow to marinate for at least 20 minutes but up to 24 hours covered in the fridge.\n2.  **Cook the chicken and bacon:** Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium-high heat then cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. I prefer cooking the bacon in the air fryer. Alternatively bake the bacon in a hot oven until crisp or cooked to your preference.\n3.  **Assemble the salad:** Arrange lettuce on a large serving platter then top with ripe tomatoes, sliced avocado, crispy bacon and the sliced chicken. To make the dressing, combine olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and salt and pour over the salad before serving.\n\n### How to make grilled chicken for salad\n\nMake a quick marinade with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, herbs of your choice (rosemary, thyme and oregano are always a safe bet) and season generously with salt and pepper. Pour over boneless, skinless chicken breasts and allow to marinate while you heat the grill or grill pan. Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until cooked through and golden brown on both sides. The internal temperature should be 75**°**C or 165**°**F. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. You can also use **[pan fried chicken](https://simply-delicious-food.com/pan-fried-chicken-breast/)** for this recipe.\n\n### Why is it important to let meat rest after cooking?\n\nResting meat or chicken allows the juices to be redistributed throughout the meat instead of running out onto the cutting board. This is because the meat tenses up during cooking and allowing it to rest, literally allows the meat to relax and will result in juicier meat or chicken.\n\n![Grilled chicken on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-2.jpg)\n\nCan I make this ahead?\n----------------------\n\nThe chicken can be marinated for up to 24 hours in the fridge. Cooked chicken can be kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To prep the salad in advance, I would keep the dressing separate as it will cause the lettuce to wilt. Slice the avocado and dress the salad right before serving.\n\nWhat to serve with blt chicken salad\n------------------------------------\n\nThis salad is a fantastic gluten-free/keto meal on its own. If you want to add side dishes, a loaf of **[crusty bread](https://simply-delicious-food.com/easy-crusty-bread-recipe/)** is always delicious with salad.\n\n![Easy lemon-herb dressing on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-4.jpg)\n\n*   **[BBQ chicken salad with charred corn](https://simply-delicious-food.com/bbq-chicken-salad-with-charred-corn/)**\n*   [**Greek chicken salad**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/greek-chicken-salad/)\n*   [**Peri-Peri chicken salad with charred corn**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/peri-peri-chicken-salad/)\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blt-chicken-salad-3-2-266x266.jpg)\n\n#### For the grilled chicken\n\n*   4 chicken breasts boneless + skinless\n*   2 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   2 garlic cloves crushed\n*   1 tsp salt\n*   ½ tsp black pepper\n\n#### For the salad\n\n*   8 strips streaky bacon cooked to your preference\n*   lettuce\n*   baby tomatoes halved\n*   1 avocado sliced\n\n#### For the lemon-herb dressing\n\n*   3 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   salt and pepper to taste\n\n*   Combine all the marinade ingredients and mix well. Pour over the chicken and allow to marinade while you pre-heat the grill or grill pan on the stove.\n    \n*   Cook the the chicken for 4-5 minutes per side (depending on thickness) until cooked through and golden brown on both sides.\n    \n*   Remove from the heat and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing.\n    \n*   To assemble the salad, add a bed of lettuce to serving plates and top with tomatoes, sliced avocado, crispy bacon and sliced chicken.\n    \n*   Mix together the dressing ingredients then drizzle over the salad before serving.\n    \n\nCalories: 375kcal | Carbohydrates: 6g | Protein: 26g | Fat: 28g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 73mg | Sodium: 735mg | Potassium: 662mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 105IU | Vitamin C: 12.6mg | Calcium: 22mg | Iron: 0.9mg\n\nMore delicious bacon recipes\n----------------------------\n\n1.

Same delicious recipe!_\n\nI don’t think I could ever tire of strawberries. And with strawberry season here and gone so quickly, we must take advantage!\n\nHere in the Midwest, summertime is a constant reminder to truly take things in. To enjoy the days as they are. To accept both the hot (often humid here) weather and the thunderstorms. To take advantage of the long days and spend more time with one another. To get outside and enjoy nature and the blue skies before it gets cold and gray again.\n\nEven though the days are longer, these months do not last long, and I’m finding that summer teaches us to be more present. To appreciate what we have when we have it. It is all about perspective. And finding joy in the little things.\n\nThe Perfect Strawberry Salad\n----------------------------\n\nThis spinach strawberry salad recipe is going to be on repeat all season!\n\nIt’s the perfect **light and refreshing lunch or dinner salad** – just add your favorite protein like chicken breasts, [salmon](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/sweet-spicy-glazed-salmon-paleo/), tempeh, [roasted chickpeas](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/chickpea-shawarma-bowls/), etc.\n\nThe **coconut honey lime dressing adds unique flavor** and is so delicious – I could drink it!\n\nThis simple salad can be **easily customizable and adapted to your liking.** Or your guests liking, depending on who you’re enjoying it with.\n\nThis is the **perfect salad recipe for picky eaters** – who doesn’t love strawberries and sweet creamy poppy seed dressing?\n\n[![hands using silver salad tongs in bowl of spinach with strawberries](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-14.jpg)](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-14.jpg)\n\nSalad Ingredients\n-----------------\n\n*   **spinach –** I prefer spinach for this strawberry salad but you could always do a mix of greens or use what you have on hand.\n*   **strawberries** – fresh, juicy ones! If you can find them local, even better this time of year.\n*   **toasted pecans** – I love pecans here for their slight sweetness and soft crunch. Use toasted ones for more flavor.\n*   **feta** – one of my favorites with a strawberry salad but omit if you need to. Or sub goat cheese if you prefer that.\n\n[![ingredients on board, labeled, crumbled feta, olive oil, strawberries, honey, pecans, poppy seeds, limes, fresh spinach, sea salt and coconut milk](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-ingredients.jpg)](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-ingredients.jpg)\n\nThis is a unique take on a poppy seed dressing – using coconut milk, honey and lime!\n\n**Here’s what you need:**\n\n*   **honey** – you could sub [maple syrup](https://rstyle.me/+_fDunjtLL7Et4SWZ3T_8Kw) if you’d like\n*   **limes** – I love the lime flavor in this mixed with the coconut!\n*   **[canned coconut milk](http://amzn.to/2w4Xh0a)** – canned coconut is the best for rich texture and flavor\n*   **poppy seeds** – for delicious crunch\n*   **fine sea** **salt** – to enhance flavor\n\nThis poppy seed salad dressing is flavorful, dairy free and much healthier than the traditional recipe.

Here, I’ve included the method used by restaurants to get that ideal, slightly dried-out rice without having to wait a day. The YouTube channel [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChineseCookingDemystified/) is one of my favorite places to go for all my Chinese culinary questions. The method that its hosts Steph and Chris use to par-boil then steam the rice is borderline miraculous in the results you get. The Delish kitchen team was floored at the consistent texture you get with the rice, and I for one will not be cooking my rice any other way going forward.  \n• **Oil:** Choose an oil with a high-smoke point, and don’t be afraid to use a lot of oil—this is fried rice after all.  \n• **Eggs**: I use 3 large eggs in this recipe. I prefer to have some white streaks in my eggs, so I barely beat them together.  \n• **Garlic:** I like my fried rice super garlicky, so I use 5 cloves. You can take it back if you want, but honestly, I don’t suggest it—the more garlic, the better.  \n• **Ginger:** About an inch of ginger, minced very small, goes with the garlic before adding in our veggies.  \n• **Scallions:** When chopping your scallions, separate the whites and the greens. The green we’ll use as a garnish, and the white we’ll cook with.  \n• **Soy Sauce:** The first thing you’ll notice about this recipe is that soy sauce is included. While to some, this might not be super-traditional in fried rice, a lot of American eaters (and Delish taste testers) prefer it! Because there is no meat or seafood in this fried rice, after some testing, I felt it added some extra body and umami to the rice that is totally delicious. I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce so you can control the salt amount.  \n• **Sugar:** I believe that all savory dishes should be finished off with a bit of sugar if there isn’t a natural source of sweetness in it. It helps to round out the dish and provide a more complex flavor.  \n• **White Pepper:** White pepper is underutilized outside of fancier kitchens, but it’s worth buying if you can. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite things about this recipe; at home, I’ll add even more. It’s earthy, and has less of a kick than black pepper.  \n• **MSG:** MSG adds the perfect sweet-salty boost to fried rice. It’s a widely misunderstood ingredient—checkout this article all about [MSG](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35119070/msg-monosodium-glutamate/) if you’re looking to learn more.  \n• **Peas:** I personally love peas in fried rice, and find it’s a common addition in many American versions. Don’t worry about using frozen peas, they won’t emit too much moisture to the rice.  \n• **Butter:** Using butter is a bit controversial, but it adds a wonderful richness, and a little bit goes a long way. If you really don’t want to use it, you can omit it.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nLeftover rice works perfectly for fried rice, so if you have some hanging out in your fridge, use it here. But, if you don’t have any, never fear: I’ve found a 2-step technique to make freshly cooked rice absolutely perfect for fried rice. The first step of making any rice dish is to adequately clean your rice. Some people like to do this in the pot they’re going to cook their rice in, but I like to use a mesh strainer. Rinse the rice—moving around the grains frequently—until the water comes out clean.\n\nOnce your rice is ready, you’re going to par-boil the rice for just a few minutes. This will help to jumpstart the cooking process, breaking down the outsides of the grains of rice.\n\nOnce you strain the rice, we’re ready to make an impromptu steamer with a pot and a strainer that fits inside of it. First, add some water to the bottom of the pot, then put the strainer filled with your rinsed rice in it. Next, you’re going to want to create some holes in the rice with chopsticks to allow steam to circulate.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9983579638752053xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter making your holes, cover the pot with tin foil; it doesn’t have to be totally snug, but it should be well-tented. Then, cover with the pot lid and let it steam. Steaming the rice is a gentler cooking process that keeps the grains pretty dry and adds less moisture to the rice, which is what we’re looking for.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, check on your rice: It should almost taste al-dente. What I mean by this is that it should be fully cooked through, but should taste drier than normal steamed rice. Once it’s ready, I like to spread my rice on a sheet pan. This is a bit of overkill, but it will help your rice to cool down more quickly (which means fried rice faster!).\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNow that our rice is ready, let’s focus on bringing everything together. A wok is the most traditional way to cook fried rice, and it does work especially well. The movement and centralized heat are very helpful, and its size holds a large amount of rice . But if you don’t have one, don’t let that stop you: I’ve made incredible fried rice in a cast iron skillet.\n\nBarely beat the eggs together (if you prefer some whites in your egg) before adding to your wok. Once you add to the wok, move your eggs around quickly, pressing in with a spatula to make those perfect fried rice egg squiggles. Once they’re ready, take them out, and give your wok a quick wipe down. I recommend pre-cooking your eggs because if they sit in the fried rice for awhile, they will get overcooked.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNext, it’s time to add your oil. Don’t be shy here: This is fried rice after all, so add enough to coat all of the grains in the oil. Add in your ginger and garlic: This will help flavor the oil which will transfer to your entire dish. Then, add the green onions and cook until softened, flipping and stirring frequently to prevent any burning.\n\nAdd all of your rice, tossing and stirring it constantly (I mean it!). You should see the grains start to become individual, which is the tell-tale sign of a well-done fried rice. Once you see that the rice is separating, it’s time to add your seasonings and soy sauce.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nOnce your rice is perfectly seasoned and separated, it’s time to add in your eggs and peas.

    "markdown": "# Baked Zucchini Fries with Parmesan KETO, LOW CARB | Best Recipe Box\nOur Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries recipe is low carb and keto friendly. Learn how to make healthy zucchini fries instead of potatoes for a less guilty snack. These are so flavorful! \n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries on a cutting board ](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-2.jpg \"Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox\")\n\nEasy Baked Zucchini Fries Recipe\n--------------------------------\n\nWhat to do when life gives you a ton of zucchini? Make baked parmesan zucchini fries! And more of it please! It’s really a fantastic way to use up zucchini when you run out of zucchini recipe ideas. When you’re craving fries, without all the starch from potatoes, using zucchini is a fabulous way to satisfy those cravings without all the calories. It’s mind blowing how delicious and easy these zucchini fries are. And it’s even more mind blowing why we didn’t make them earlier because they’re low carb, no bread crumbs and tasty!\n\n**Video: Healthy Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries** \n-------------------------------------------------\n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries on a cutting board ](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-1.jpg \"Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox\")\n\nZucchini Fries Recipe with No Bread Crumbs KETO\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*   The flavors are outstanding. We add parmesan, some paprika, fresh herbs and other spices to really add amazing flavor to the humble zucchini sticks. They’re simply delicious and a perfect zucchini fry appetizer for anytime you’re wanting a simple dish to have a party.\n*   Add some extra onion powder for another kick of flavor.\n*   Have you tried steak seasoning? It’s not just for steak! This seasoning is really great on the zucchini.\n*   Even beyond a great finger food, they’re definitely lighter than potatoes. These zucchini fries are baked and all the wonderful flavors get cooked into the zucchini. Each bite is wonderful and low carb!\n*   All recipe details are in the recipe box below.\n\n### Keto Coating Options\n\nThere’s several more options for keto “bread crumbs” other than the parmesan cheese that we use.\n\n*    Crushed pork rinds are probably the most common and popular. You can buy these pre-crushed and ready to use. Or you can buy a bag of pork rinds and then grind them in your food processor. This option allows you to customize the grind of your pork rinds. You can make the coating find or more coarse/crunchy.\n*   Almond flour is another popular option. But we find that the parmesan cheese and crushed pork rinds will result in the most crispy outside texture. If you don’t use enough oil spray on the outside of the almond flour, the crust can be rather mushy and dry.\n*   Sesame seeds are another option. You’ll get a great flavor of sesame on the zucchini.\n\n### Can You Make this Ahead of time?\n\nYou can make these ahead, but they’ll be pretty soggy the next day. Best way to crisp them up is in a toaster oven or [air fryer](https://bestrecipebox.com/air-fryer-zucchini/). Add a light oil spray over them so they don’t dry out during heating.\n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-1-250x250.jpg)\n\nBaked Parmesan Zucchini Fries\n-----------------------------\n\nYield: 6 servings\n\nPrep Time: 5 minutes\n\nCook Time: 18 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 23 minutes\n\nThese are so good, not \"crispy\" becuase they're healthy but still tasty. There's no bread crumbs so they're a little healthier than most zucchini fries recipes and less crispy. If you want them crispy and not keto, add bread crumbs to the coating, then spray the outside before baking.\n\n*   1 1/2 lbs. (680 g) zucchini ,cut lengthwise into wedges (about 3 medium zucchini)\n*   1/2 cup (50 g) freshly grated Parmesan\n*   1 teaspoon (5 ml) dried herbs – thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, etc…\n*   1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) smoked paprika\n*   1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) garlic powder\n*   [Kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2LzFKoG) , to taste\n*   black pepper , to taste (freshly ground if possible)\n*   2 tablespoons (30 ml) [olive oil](https://amzn.to/2uMlvKN)\n*   3 tablespoons (45 ml) chopped fresh parsley leaves\n\n*   Preheat oven to 400° F. Line baking sheet with parchment or aluminum foil. Spray with non-stick cooking spray.\n    \n*   In bowl, combine Parmesan, dried herbs, smoked paprika and garlic powder salt and pepper, to taste.\n    \n*   Toss the zucchini with olive oil and roll in parmesan/herb mixture to coat all sides. Place zucchini onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with extra parmesan/herb mixture if needed.\n    \n*   Bake until crisp, about 15 minutes. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown.\n    \n    Garnish with parsley.

    "markdown": "# Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich - FeelGoodFoodie\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/privacy-policy/).\n\nThis delicious grilled mozzarella sandwich is perfect to make when you want something fresh with a gourmet quality, but don’t want to go to a restaurant. **Homemade walnut pesto, fresh tomatoes and melted mozzarella** make every bite full of flavor. Be sure to make a double batch of the pesto so you can whip up a tasty sandwich later on in the week.\n\n![Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich made with walnut pesto, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-8.jpg)\n\nRECIPE VIDEO TUTORIAL\n---------------------\n\nHow to make grilled mozzarella sandwich – step by step\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n### To make the pesto\n\nPlace the **basil, garlic, walnuts and Parmesan cheese in the food processor;** season with salt and pepper, to taste, and blend. While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n\n![Collage showing how to make walnut pesto before and after blending in food processor](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-Collage1.jpg)\n\n### To assemble the sandwiches\n\nYou will need some **sourdough bread** sliced about ½ inch thick, **whole mozzarella cheese**, the **pesto** you just successfully whipped up, along with large **tomato slices and roasted red pepper**.\n\n![Ingredients to make the recipes: bread, pesto, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-3-640x427.jpg)\n\nNext, you’ll want to **spread the pesto** on four slices of the sourdough bread, and place two of the slices right on the panini maker with the pesto side up.\n\n![Spreading walnut pesto on the bread before assembling and grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-4-640x427.jpg)\n\nThe assembly all happens in the panini maker, [like this one](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) (or toaster oven or grill pan). Add the mozzarella cheese on right away, and give it a minute to settle in and start melting. Start piling the tomatoes and roasted red peppers (carefully).\n\n![Two open faced sandwiches in the panini topped with tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-5-640x427.jpg)\n\nAnd then, **close the sandwich with the remaining bread** (pesto side down) and close the panini maker. This is seriously the hardest part of the recipe. The type of bread you use and how high you stack the sandwich can really make or break the sandwich. You want to **lightly press on the sandwich** so we don’t end up with a pressed pile of cheesy bread (although I have done it and it is delicious still haha!)\n\n![Sandwich assembled in the panini before grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-6-640x427.jpg)\n\nYou’ll know it’s done when the bread is crispy and golden brown and the mozzarella cheese is melty. It’s a sandwich recipe that looks totally gourmet and tastes out of this world!\n\n![Sandwich after coming off the panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-7.jpg)\n\nTips for making grilled mozzarella sandwich\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Don’t have a panini maker?** [This panini maker](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) is great, or you can use a toaster oven to achieve the same result (minus those pretty grill lines). You can also use a grill pan or regular pan to make this sandwich recipe.\n2.  **Don’t have a food processor?** Just buy store-bought pesto! But really, if you can find a way to make your own pesto, it really takes this sandwich to another level.\n3.  Make sure you use the **freshest ingredients** you can for maximum flavor. That is especially true for the basil and the mozzarella cheese.\n4.  **Use thick sturdy sourdough bread** that is not airy on the inside to ensure the sandwich stays put when you press on it in the panini maker.\n\n![Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich made with walnut pesto, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-8.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Is a grilled mozzarella sandwich healthy?\n\nOne sandwich comes in at under 450 calories, so even though it’s not low in calories, it’s certainly **better for you than a lot of store bought sandwiches**. Making your own pesto is certainly a healthier option than buying store bought because there aren’t preservatives or milk or other unnecessary ingredients added. To make the sandwich lighter, you can use whole wheat bread which contains more fiber, and you can use a low fat mozzarella if you so wish.\n\n### How do you make homemade walnut pesto?\n\nPesto is so easy to make at home. We are all so used to buying the jarred stuff, but fresh is always better! Use a **good olive oil, super fresh basil leaves (or any greens really) and some nuts**. Add the dry ingredients to a food processor, and while they are combining, slowly pour in the olive oil. Easy! Be sure to make an extra batch and stir it into fresh pasta!\n\n![Mozzarella Grilled Sandwich stacked with basil on the side](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-9.jpg)\n\nFor more delicious sandwich recipes:\n------------------------------------\n\n*   [Turkey Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/turkey-panini/)\n*   [Roasted Vegetable Grilled Cheese Sandwich](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Pesto Chicken Avocado Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/pesto-chicken-avocado-panini/)\n*   [Cheesy Chicken & Broccoli Wraps](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/cheesy-chicken-broccoli-wraps/)\n\nI really hope you enjoy this grilled mozzarella sandwich recipe as much as we did!

I would love to hear about your experience making it. And if you snapped some shots of it, share it with me on Instagram so I can repost on my stories!\n\n![](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cookbook2.png)\n\nPrep Time 10 minutes\n\nCook Time 5 minutes\n\nTotal Time 15 minutes\n\n#### For the Sandwich\n\n*   ▢ 4 slices sourdough bread\n*   ▢ 4 oz mozzarella cheese sliced\n*   ▢ 1 large tomato sliced\n*   ▢ 2 oz roasted red peppers jarred\n\n#### For the Pesto\n\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves\n*   ▢ 2 cloves garlic clove peeled\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons [walnuts](https://amzn.to/3l3EWMl)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan\n*   ▢ [Salt and pepper](https://amzn.to/3WZ1xXy)\n*   ▢ 1/4 cup [olive oil](https://amzn.to/3dfY3Ld)\n\n*   To make the pesto, place the basil, garlic, walnuts and Parmesan cheese in the food processor; season with salt and pepper, to taste, and blend. While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n    \n*   Spread the pesto equally on the 4 slices of bread and place two slices of bread on the panini maker or in a toaster oven for 2 minutes.\n    \n*   Then place the mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers on top of two bread slices and allow the cheese to melt and the veggies to soften, keeping the panini maker open.\n    \n*   Once the cheese starts to melt, add the second slices on top to close the sandwiches, then close the panini maker for 2-3 minutes. Remove, slice in half and serve immediately\n    \n\n**Storage:** Leftover pesto should be covered and stored in the refrigerator, it will keep fresh for one week. I would not recommend storing the sandwich though for more than a couple hours. If you have sandwich leftovers, it’s best to reheat using a toaster oven or panini maker.\n\n**Make Ahead Tips:** You can make the pesto up to one week in advance and then use in the the grilled sandwich when you’re ready.\n\n**Substitutes:** For best results, follow the recipe as is. However here are some common substitutes that would work well in this recipe.\n\n*   _Instead whole mozzarella_, you can use shredded mozzarella. Although I think it creates a completely different flavor and texture to the sandwich.\n*   _Instead of walnuts_, you can use other nuts, like pine nuts, almonds or pecans, to make the pesto\n\n**Equipment**: I use the [Kitchen Aid 7-Cup Food processor](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KFP0718CU-7-Cup-Processor-Puree/dp/B07BVYPDJ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=30RV8LXKUP8I8&keywords=kitchenaid+7+cup+food+processor&qid=1552749952&s=gateway&sprefix=kitchen+aid+7+cup,aps,240&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=feelgoodfoodie-20&linkId=35c757d4f7499b6121fbed25a3cbd49d&language=en_US) [Kitchen Aid 11-Cup Food Processor](https://amzn.to/2Qe4KFo) to to make the pesto. It has a high and low pulse speed so you can make the pesto as smooth or chunky as you’d like. And it has a 3-in-1 wide mouth feed tube to make it easier to slowly add olive oil while the machine is running.\n\nIt’s so fun to make sandwiches in my panini maker. I have the [Cuisinart 5-in-1 Griddler](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-GR-4N-Griddler-Silver-Black/dp/B002YD99Y4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1542920577&sr=1-3&keywords=panini+press&linkCode=ll1&tag=feelgoodfoodie-20&linkId=e26e82b7b800340cdaa315d148d53165&language=en_US) – pretty much a magic appliance in my kitchen that does so much! If you don’t have a panini grill, you can use a skillet and cook the sandwich for 2 minutes per side, pressing down with a spatula as you cook.\n\nServing: 1g, Calories: 449kcal, Carbohydrates: 41g, Protein: 16g, Fat: 25g, Saturated Fat: 6g, Cholesterol: 24mg, Sodium: 742mg, Potassium: 302mg, Fiber: 2g, Sugar: 3g, Vitamin A: 960IU, Vitamin C: 16.1mg, Calcium: 224mg, Iron: 3mg\n\nNutrition information provided is an estimate.

We have spent it almost entirely doing wall prep (3 days!!) and painting (1 day) our guest bedroom and we were dead people walking at the end of yesterday. When we ventured out for dinner last night, we were so tired that we were barely able to keep our eyes open.\n\nIt was really hard work, but it paid off – the room already looks ten times better and it’s not even finished yet. We are nearly done with the ceiling and the walls (the 3rd and final coat of paint goes on tomorrow), but the skirting boards and the radiator will need to wait until our guests leave, as we don’t want to poison them with paint fumes. My brother and his partner are visiting us this Friday and, especially after the weekend we’ve had, we are really looking forward to spending some relaxing time with them. We have not seen each other for ages and they recently returned from some exciting travels, so we cannot wait to catch up and hear all they’ve been up to.\n\nWhile Duncan and myself are more into sweet kind of breakfasts, I know that my brother especially prefers a savoury brekkie. So I’ve been thinking about what I could make for him and this simple vegan breakfast bowl is what I came up with. It’s a dish that marries a lot of leftovers together and it isn’t worse for it.\n\nI used already cooked and cooled potatoes, which I pan-fried in a little olive oil. I charred some cherry toms under a hot grill until they split open and became jammy and delicious (beware as they stay dangerously hot for ages!!). I wilted some spinach that wasn’t fresh enough to put in a salad anymore and finally made vegan scrambled eggs from some silken tofu, flavoured with aromatics and magical black salt, which due to its high sulphur content, makes tofu taste like eggs.\n\nIt may sound very niche and fancy, but it’s a staple of Indian cuisine, so if you live in the UK, a well-stocked Indian-run corner store is a great place to get it. While it’s called black salt (or [kala namak](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak)), it is dusty pink when ground up fine, so keep your eyes open for that. This dish is filling, full of contrasting textures and flavours and super quick to put together. It will make an awesome savoury breakfast or brunch and I am hoping that it will make our non-vegan guests happy.\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl ingredients](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-ingredients.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl potatoes](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-potatoes.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl portion](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-portion-800x1200.jpg)\n\n*   olive oil\n*   a bunch of cherry tomatoes on the vine\n*   250 g / 9 oz cooked and cooled small potatoes, halved\n*   salt to taste\n*   black pepper, to taste\n*   100 g / 3.5 oz baby spinach\n*   1 large shallot, finely diced\n*   1 garlic clove, finely diced\n*   300 g / 10.5 oz silken firm tofu (I use [Clearspring](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/silken-tofu))\n*   ¼ tsp turmeric, adjust to taste\n*   ¼ tsp [black salt](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak) (has eggy taste), adjust to taste\n*   ½ ripe avocado, cut in half\n\nMETHOD\n\n1.  Brush tomatoes with a little oil (keeping them on the vine if you can) and place them on a small baking tray. Stick them under a grill / broiler for 5-10 minutes, until their skins burst and the tops char a little. Season and set aside.\n2.  Heat up 2 tsp of olive oil on a small frying pan. Place cold potatoes, cut side down on the hot oil and allow them to fry gently until nicely browned. Season with salt and pepper.\n3.  Place spinach on another pan with a splash of water. Allow the spinach to wilt using gentle heat. Move it around the pan with a pair of tongs. Season and lift wilted spinach out of the pan, draining any excess water away.\n4.  Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan (I reused the one I used to wilt the spinach) and fry diced shallot and garlic on a very gentle heat.\n5.  Once shallot is translucent and garlic fragrant (but not browned), add the drained tofu. Smash it a little with the back of a spoon. Season with turmeric, black salt (it will give it eggy taste) and pepper.\n6.  Divide all the elements (including the avocado) between two bowls and drizzle with extra olive oil if needed."

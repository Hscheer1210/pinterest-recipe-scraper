This shrimp avocado salad is **healthy, filling, satisfying, and light**. It's a well-balanced meal that combines veggies (avocado and arugula), protein (shrimp), a small amount of your favorite fruit (I used mango), and nuts (I used pine nuts). It's **super-versatile and flexible**, and you can use a wide variety of ingredients and substitutions (see more on that below the recipe card). I've made it so many times this Summer because it definitely became one of my family's most requested salads! This recipe is a great way to dress up and give so much flavor to **the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp**. Or cook raw shrimp from scratch using one of my recipes: [shrimp scampi with capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/) or [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n\nCrowd-pleasing Summer salad\n---------------------------\n\nThis light and refreshing salad takes under 20 minutes to make, which is great for busy weeknights. You only need **6 main ingredients** - shrimp, avocado, spinach, mango, pine nuts, and red onions.  The salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). Shrimp avocado salad also makes a stunning presentation - perfect for sharing with the crowd! **Bring this Summer salad to picnics, potlucks, barbecue parties, and other outdoor Summer festivities.** Or, serve it indoors for those special occasions when you want to impress your guests without spending too much time in the kitchen.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-1-1.jpg \"Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.\")\n\nIs it a healthy salad?\n----------------------\n\n*   **Packed with nutrients.** Shrimp avocado salad combines so many good-for-you ingredients. It's highly nutritious, packed with fiber and protein, and low in calories. It's gluten-free and dairy-free. It's also pescatarian - perfect for vegetarians who incorporate seafood into their diets.  It will make a delicious healthy addition to the list of your family's favorites.\n*   **Shrimp** is naturally low in carbs and rich in protein. It's low-fat but the fat that it does provide is a good kind of fat (beneficial omega-3 fatty acids).\n*   **Avocado** is packed with healthy fats and is a great source of vitamins B6, C,  E, and K. It also provides folate, magnesium, potassium, and copper.\n*   **Mango** is an excellent source of vitamin C.\n*   **Arugula** is rich in Vitamins A, C, and K, and is a great source of calcium, potassium, and folate.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-recipe-1-1-300x300.jpg)\n\nShrimp Avocado Salad is a quick and easy **Mediterranean-style recipe** that makes a great side salad, lunch, or light dinner.

You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.\n*   **Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.\n*   **Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad. I recommend mango, peaches, nectarines, and apricots. You can also add citrus fruit which will pair well with shrimp, such as oranges, mandarine oranges, or grapefruit.\n*   **Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice.\n\nTips for Success\n----------------\n\n*   **Use pre-cooked shrimp.** It saves so much time, and this avocado salad is just a great way to dress up the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp.\n*   **Any size of shrimp works.** I do prefer to use large, but this is a great recipe to use up smaller cooked shrimp!\n*   **Cook shrimp from scratch.** If you have raw shrimp, simply cook it on the stovetop. Here is a nice, light recipe for [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/).\n*   **Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!\n*   **Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.\n\nHow to tell if an avocado is ripe?\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.\n*   **An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.\n\nMake-ahead tips\n---------------\n\n*   If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.\n*   Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.\n\nMore shrimp recipes\n-------------------\n\n*   [Garlic Butter Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/garlic-butter-shrimp/)\n*   [Shrimp Scampi with Capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n*   [Honey-Mustard Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/honey-mustard-garlic-shrimp/)\n*   [Lemon Shrimp Orzo](https://juliasalbum.com/lemon-shrimp-orzo-asparagus/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime and Black Bean Rice Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-black-bean-shrimp-and-rice/)\n\nOther healthy salads you might like\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   [Apple Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/apple-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Holiday Salad with Spinach, Mandarin Oranges, Pecans, Cranberries, Goat Cheese, and Honey-Mustard Lime Vinaigrette](https://juliasalbum.com/holiday-salad/)\n*   [Peach Blueberry Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/peach-blueberry-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Berry Spinach Salad with Blueberries, Raspberries, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/berry-spinach-salad-with-blueberries-raspberries/)\n*   [Strawberry Spinach Salad with Feta cheese, Pecans, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/strawberry-spinach-salad-recipe/)\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

It’s tossed in a delicious citrus vinaigrette, and is the perfect way to eat more veggies!\n\n![arugula salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1A75F2BE-F73B-4B84-B7DA-4EA275C10086-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**Arugula Citrus Salad**\n------------------------\n\nNow that the weather is starting to get warmer, I’m all about light and fresh salads during the week. This arugula citrus salad is filled with so many feel-good ingredients, and is the perfect lunch to serve as is or with a grilled piece of protein.\n\nIt’s filled with crunchy toasted almonds, fresh orange slices, tricolor quinoa, and hearty chickpeas. The salad is tossed in a homemade citrus vinaigrette, and is seriously the perfect spring salad!\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13FE18F3-23DF-477F-AE22-ECF1609DE7BC-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThere are so many ways to prepare delicious hearty salads, but sometimes they can get repetitive. Here are a few tips to make the best salads at home:\n\n1.  Add a grain- grains add such a hearty component to salads, and can take them from a side dish to a main meal\n2.  Add a crunch- you’ll rarely ever see me eating a salad without some form of nuts or seeds added. They add such a delicious crunch and help give texture to your salads. Toasting the nuts is an extra step, but adds the most rich flavor!\n3.  Add canned beans- canned beans are an affordable way to add more flavor, fiber and protein to your salads. My go-to’s are usually chickpeas and cannellini beans since they’re subtle tasting and work well with so many flavors\n4.  Finish it off with cheese! Whether you use dairy or vegan cheese, the saltiness provides delicious depth of flavor and adds a little more heartiness to your salad\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/683056D7-F6A4-4A70-8124-07DE41DDBAD0-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What you’ll need to make this arugula citrus salad:**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Arugula- the arugula keeps this salad light and fresh. It’s the perfect base for this citrus salad\n*   Quinoa- I love adding quinoa to this salad, but other grains that would also work well are farro, barley, or pearled couscous\n*   Avocado- a slightly firm avocado is ideal for any salad since it will keep its shape and still have flavor\n*   Oranges- for added freshness and sweetness\n*   Chickpeas- for a boost of fiber and protein\n*   Crumbled cheese- feta is my go-to for salads, but feel free to swap any cheese of choice\n*   Homemade citrus vinaigrette\n\n![](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06007365-5420-479E-BCE8-C39099F47B57-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThe sweet, salty and savory flavors in this salad work so well together. It’s delicious on its own as a light lunch, but I love serving it with a grilled piece of salmon for an added boost of protein.\n\nThis salad is so simple to make, easily customizable, and is the perfect way to eat more salads this season!\n\n![arugula salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/F6E723C9-4EC3-421E-AFFE-633FC3A3AACD-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What to serve with your arugula citrus salmon:**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Honey Jalapeno Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-jalapeno-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pasta with Roasted Asparagus](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pasta-with-roasted-asparagus/)\n\n### [Honey Za’atar Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-zaatar-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pepper Tofu](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pepper-tofu/)\n\nArugula Citrus Salad\n--------------------\n\nCourse: Main\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1/2 cup 1/2 uncooked quinoa\n    \n*   1 cup 1 vegetable broth or water\n    \n*   5 oz 5 arugula, about 5-6 cups\n    \n*   1 can 1 chickpeas, drained (15 oz)\n    \n*   2 medium 2 avocados, slightly firm is ideal- cut into cubes\n    \n*   1 1 orange, peeled and chopped\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 slivered almonds\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 crumbled feta cheese\n    \n*   **Citrus Vinaigrette**\n*   1/4 cup 1/4 olive oil\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 orange juice\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 lemon juice\n    \n*   1 clove 1 garlic, crushed\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 dijon mustard\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 pure maple syrup\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 chopped red onion or shallots\n    \n*   Salt & pepper\n    \n\n### Directions\n\n*   Add the quinoa and vegetable broth to a sauce pan and bring it to a boil.

Remove the pot from the heat and it let sit for 10 minutes while you prepare your salad ingredients. After 10 minutes, fluff with a fork and season with a little salt.\n*   While the quinoa cooks, add you slivered almonds to a sheet pan and set them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes to toast. Alternatively, you can toast them in a small pan over a medium flame until they start to brown.\n*   Prepare your salad dressing by combining all of the ingredients together.\n*   Add your arugula to a large salad bowl and toss it together with half of the dressing.\n*   Add the quinoa, chickpeas, oranges, avocado, toasted almonds and cheese and top it with the remaining dressing.\n*   Toss to combine and enjoy!\n\n### Did you make this recipe?\n\nTag @somethingnutritious on Instagram- I’d love to see your creations!"

In fact, I didn’t tell anyone I made these because I am selfish like that.\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903_121134-2.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nIf you have never had Delicata Squash, boy oh boy, you are in for a treat, and I highly suggest you get your bottom down to the grocery store right now and grab a couple (or 10).  It’s lighter in flavor than any of the other squashes around.  I don’t know about you guys with kids, but squash is pretty much the only thing that my kids don’t like eating.  Well not delicata.   It is the first thing off their plates.\n\nMy favorite thing about this squash though has to be the fact that you don’t have to peel it.  Yup, that’s right!  You can eat the skin of these bad boys!  Well technically you can eat the skin of any winter squash, but it probably won’t be that tasty.  Don’t worry though, this skin is delicious!\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Roasted-Delicata-Squash.png?resize=640%2C960&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nWhat I love about delicata squash is that you can put ANY seasonings you feel like sprinkling on there and it will be out of this world good.  Here are a few of my favorite seasoning blends for it….\n\n1.  [PRIMAL PALATE](https://www.primalpalate.com/organic-spices/ref/88/) French Onion blend.\n2.  My ranch blend from [HERE](https://pretenditsadonut.com/2018/01/16/sheet-pan-ranch-pork-loin/)\n3.  Salt and dried thyme.\n\nBut my favorite spice blend has to be the one you are about to read in the recipe.  Finger-lickin-wish I had doubled the batch-good.\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903_121141-2.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nThese are definitely best eaten right away while they are still warm.  They aren’t terrible cold, but your mouth will be much happier with them straight outta the oven.  I sometimes save some to put in my kids lunches, because I don’t really care if they eat it cold!  And they don’t mind either.  At least I don’t think they mind.  They’ve never complained. So that’s a plus!\n\nROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\n\nIngredients\n\n*   2 medium Delicata Squash, sliced 1/8 of an inch thick\n*   2 tbl avocado oil\n*   squeeze of lime\n*   Fresh cilantro for garnish\n\nSPICE BLEND:\n\n*   1 tbl paprika\n*   1 1/2 tsp chipotle powder\n*   1 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n*   1 tsp cumin\n*   1 tsp sea salt\n\nCHIPOTLE AIOLI:\n\n*   1/4 cup mayonnaise\n*   1 tsp spice blend\n*   1 tsp lime juice\n\nInstructions\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls - Ev's Eats\n[Jump to Recipe](#mv-creation-94-jtr)\n\nA little magic went down in the kitchen earlier today, and they involve these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls.\n\nCilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin. If that’s not enough, the bowls are then topped with [mango salsa](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/) and some sweet fried plantains on the side, perfection.\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-2.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)\n\nThis recipe is special for me as it is near and dear to my heart. One of the reasons I fell in love with cooking was because I always had strong, positive female role models who always took such care and pride in preparing meals for their loved ones. From my grandma, to my mom, down to my aunties they showed me how to put love in food, and how it was the most important ingredient. Recently I lost one of my aunties, and I want to dedicate this post and recipe to her.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of my Aunt was her preparing breakfast for my Uncle and all of her nieces and nephews. She used to make the best sausages, and her kitchen was never dull as she would dance and sing all while cooking. We used to laugh as kids because food used to fly around the kitchen whenever she was in there, and man her food was ALWAYS amazing!\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-9.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nIt’s been tough dealing with losing her, but I take comfort in knowing that she’s always with me especially when I’m in the kitchen. In my culture, we celebrate life and not death. So to celebrate her life and the love of the journey that life takes us all on, I decided to get in the kitchen and whip up these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls (something I know she would’ve loved) and pour a glass of [Wente Vineyard’s Riva Ranch Chardonnay](https://ooh.li/83923f3) as a toast to her and all the lives she touched.\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-5.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nThese bowls are full of life, flavor, and spice just like my aunty. Let me break down the components of yumminess for you!\n\n1.  Cuban Style Chicken- I marinated this chicken in such amazing spices! Cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, chili powder, fresh garlic, lime juice and zest, and orange juice and zest! This chicken is perfect with pretty much anything. In a salad, tacos, sandwiches, etc!  Very similar to my [Mojo Cuban Pork](https://evseats.com/cuban-sandwiches/) recipe, how can you pass up on delicious moist and juicy chicken?!\n2.  Cuban Style Black Beans- Oh! These may just be my favorite part! More amazing flavors of cumin and smoked paprika. I mash half of the beans and mix it all together to keep some texture, and it’s just delicious! I’ve been known to just eat a whole pan of these, lol!\n3.  Cilantro Lime Rice- Okay by now we all know how much I love rice, but this rice is next level!

To a blender, combine the ingredients for the chicken marinade. Add the cumin, chili powder, dried oregano, salt and pepper, 4 cloves garlic, zest and juice of 1 orange, and the zest and juice of 1 lime to the blender. Blend together until everything is finely chopped and smooth.\n2.  Add the chicken to a bowl or a Ziploc bag and pour half the marinade over the chicken. Toss to coat and allow the chicken to sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the marinade.\n3.  Heat a large skillet with vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until soft. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil allowing to toast for about a minute. Add the chicken broth and increase the heat to high, allowing it to come to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and place the lid onthe pan. Cook for about 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has absorbed.\n2.  Turn off the heat and allow rice to sit with the lid on for an additional 5 minutes. Add the lime, cilantro and season with salt and pepper, to taste.\n3.  To serve, divide the cilantro lime rice among bowls. Top with chicken and black beans. Add mango salsa and fried plantains if desired!\n\n###### Nutrition Information:\n\nYield: 4 Serving Size: 1  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 829Total Fat: 22gSaturated Fat: 3gTrans Fat: 0gUnsaturated Fat: 17gCholesterol: 71mgSodium: 1633mgCarbohydrates: 112gFiber: 23gSugar: 21gProtein: 49g\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-pin-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1)\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-Pin.jpg?resize=512%2C1024&ssl=1)"

My boyfriend and I have been making it on repeat.\n\nIt’s SO easy to cook, uses only 5 ingredients _(plus salt + pepper)_, and adds such a fun punch of flavour to zucchini.

I promise it’s super easy and takes just a few steps! Check out my answers to some common questions below:\n\n**How do you cut up zucchini?**\n\nI recommend cutting zucchini lengthwise into long strips. Remove the ends off the zucchini and cut into 1/3-inch or 1/2-inch slices.\n\nDepending on the size of your zucchini, you’ll end up with 3-4 strips per vegetable.\n\n**Should you salt zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYes! I definitely recommend salting the cut up strips of zucchini prior to grilling them. Simply sprinkle them with salt, then let them sit for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe salt will pull out a lot of the water in the zucchini, which you can pat off before putting them on the grill. This will help prevent a watery mess!\n\n**Do you peel zucchini before grilling?**\n\nNever :). I always suggest to leave the zucchini skins on. The skins of fruits + veggies often contain a TON of the nutrients and fibre. You don’t want to miss out on it!\n\n**Should you oil zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYup! I recommend brushing both sides of each zucchini slice with a little bit of olive or [avocado oil](https://www.walderwellness.com/recommends/avocado-oil/) before placing them on the grill. This helps to prevent the zucchini from drying out and sticking to the grill.\n\n![overhead shot of wood cutting board with zucchini, honey, goat cheese, and basil](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-1-683x1024.jpg)\n\nIs Grilled Zucchini Healthy?\n----------------------------\n\nYou bet! Zucchini is not only delicious, but it’s jam-packed with nutrition benefits, too.\n\nZucchini is rich in many **micronutrients**, like:\n\n*   **vitamin A**\n*   **vitamin C**\n*   **vitamin K**\n*   **vitamin** **B6**\n*   **folate**\n*   **manganese**\n*   **magnesium**\n*   **potassium**\n*   **copper**\n\nThis summer squash is also a great source of **dietary fibre**, with one medium zucchini providing 2 grams or 8% of your daily fibre needs.\n\nLike other fruits and veggies, zucchini is also a great source of **antioxidants**, especially carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin.\n\n![light blue plate with grilled zucchini slices topped with crumbled goat cheese, basil and honey](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-2-683x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat To Pair With Grilled Zucchini\n----------------------------------\n\nNeed some ideas to make this grilled zucchini a full meal?

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

    "markdown": "# Autumn Harvest Bowl - The Almond Eater\n_This post may contain affiliate links. Read our [disclaimer.](https://thealmondeater.com/contact/privacy-policy/)_ \n\n_This Autumn Harvest Bowl is warm, comforting and filled with healthy ingredients. The base is made with arugula and it's topped with quinoa, sweet potatoes and goat cheese, along with a delicious maple-tahini dressing for tons of flavor!_ \n\n![A bowl of food with Quinoa and Salad](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-1-3.jpg.webp)\n\nBowl food is the best food, and this autumn harvest bowl is perfect this time of year!\n\n \n\nOne of the many reasons why I like bowls like this (and my [vegan burrito bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/vegan-burrito-bowl/ \"Vegan Burrito Bowl\") and my [Mediterranean quinoa bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/mediterranean-quinoa-bowl/ \"Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl\")) is because they're quick and generally filled with healthy ingredients. This bowl in particular is topped with all of the best foods like sweet potato, apple, goat cheese, and the most delicious maple-tahini sauce.\n\nI still remember the first time I tried tahini. Everyone was so obsessed with it, so I had high hopes that I would be too. To be honest, plain tahini doesn't thrill me, but tahini mixed with other things IS SO GOOD. It's a great nut-free dressing or sauce option, and pairs well with so many flavors (in this case, maple syrup!).\n\nWhy you'll love this bowl\n-------------------------\n\n*   It's loaded with vegetables like arugula and sweet potato, but has plenty of protein thanks to the quinoa and chickpeas\n*   The maple tahini sauce is INSANELY good\n*   It can be enjoyed warm or cold (yes really!)\n*   It's quite similar to the harvest bowl from [Sweet Green](https://www.sweetgreen.com/), so think of this as making your own homemade version.\n\n![A bowl filled with different types of food on a plate](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-ingredients.png.webp)\n\nIngredients and substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\n**Arugula:** The base of this bowl should be some sort of greens, and I chose arugula, but other options could be spinach or massaged kale.\n\n**Quinoa:** The quinoa adds a bit of protein to this, but again, any grain works! Rice, farro, barley, etc. would all be delicious.\n\n**Sweet potatoes:** You could also used cubed and cooked butternut squash.\n\n**Cranberries:** Who doesn't love cranberries? They add a little bit of sweetness and scream \"fall\", but you could also use raisins or chopped pitted dates.\n\n**Goat cheese:** Or sub feta cheese\n\nStep-by-step instructions\n-------------------------\n\n**Step 1: Cook the quinoa and sweet potatoes.** You can do this ahead of time if you want to make this even quicker.\n\n**Step 2: Add arugula.** Place arugula in a bowl, then top it with the cooked quinoa. Then, add the remaining salad ingredients.\n\n![A bowl of arugula and quinoa](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-11.png.webp)\n\n**Step 3: Make the dressing.** Whisk tahini and maple syrup together, then drizzle it over the salad.\n\nExpert tips\n-----------\n\n*   Don't love arugula? Try using mixed greens or even kale instead.\n\n*   Do NOT to slice the apple until you're ready to eat it.\n\n*   If you don't love maple syrup, you can use honey in the dressing instead.\n\n### What if I want to add meat to this?\n\nYou can! However, since the dressing is maple-tahini, I'm not sure how well that'd pair with most meat. If you do want to add meat, I'd go with chicken, and maybe just use a different dressing.\n\nStorage\n-------\n\nIf you're prepping this harvest bowl ahead of time, you'll want to store it in the refrigerator, but in separate containers.\n\nStore the arugula, chickpeas, cranberries, and goat cheese in one container and the cooked quinoa and sweet potato in another. That way, you can reheat the potatoes and quinoa if you want.\n\n![A bowl of salad with Quinoa and Feta](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-1-4.jpg.webp)\n\nMore healthy bowls\n------------------\n\n*   [Vegan Bibimbap](https://thealmondeater.com/vegan-bibimbap/ \"Vegan Bibimbap\")\n*   [Vegan Burrito Bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/vegan-burrito-bowl/ \"Vegan Burrito Bowl\")\n*   [Cauliflower Breakfast Bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/cauliflower-breakfast-bowl/ \"Cauliflower Breakfast Bowl\")\n*   [Sun-Dried Tomato Salad](https://thealmondeater.com/arugula-sun-dried-tomato-salad/ \"Sun-Dried Tomato Salad\")\n*   [Mediterranean Hummus Bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/mediterranean-hummus-bowl/ \"Mediterranean Hummus Bowl\")\n\n_**If you made this recipe, be sure to leave a comment and star rating below.

    "markdown": "# Easy Mediterranean Diet Recipes\nFor the sixth year in a row, the Mediterranean diet has been named the [No. 1 diet by U.S. News & World Report](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021106/best-and-worst-diets-2023-us-news-world-report/). From breakfast to dinner, these easy Mediterranean diet recipes are packed with ingredients like fresh vegetables, whole grains and lean protein like fish and chicken. Plus, this eating pattern is intentionally flexible so it can be customized for any flavor preferences and dietary needs. Nutritious recipes like our Garlic Roasted Salmon & Brussels Sprouts and our Berry Chia Pudding are healthy, delicious meals that will help you follow the eating pattern with ease.\n\nSheet-Pan Chicken Thighs with Brussels Sprouts & Gnocchi\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this healthy dinner recipe, chicken thighs, Brussels sprouts, cherry tomatoes and packaged gnocchi are all roasted on the same sheet pan for a complete meal that couldn't be easier to make. And though it's simple, this dish gets tons of flavor from seasonings, including garlic, oregano and red-wine vinegar. It all adds up to a dish that's ready to go into heavy weeknight rotation in your house.\n\nEgg Sandwiches with Rosemary, Tomato & Feta\n-------------------------------------------\n\nPhotographer /Antonis Achilleos, Prop Stylist / Kay Clarke, Food Stylist / Emily Nabors Hall\n\nThese hearty breakfast sandwiches are packed with ingredients popular in the Mediterranean diet, including feta, tomato and spinach.\n\nMushroom & Tofu Stir-Fry\n------------------------\n\nThis tofu veggie stir-fry is quick and easy, making it a great go-to weeknight meal. Baked tofu has a firm, toothsome texture that crisps well in a hot pan. You can find it in flavors like teriyaki and sesame, both of which are delicious here. Or opt for a smoked version, which has the same texture with a more robust flavor. Serve over brown rice.\n\nChickpea & Quinoa Bowl with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nQuinoa and chickpeas pack this vegetarian grain bowl with plenty of plant-based protein. Whip up a batch of these flavorful grain bowls and pack them in lidded containers to stash in the fridge for easy, healthy grab-and-go lunches all week long.\n\nGarlic Roasted Salmon & Brussels Sprouts\n----------------------------------------\n\nRoasting salmon on top of Brussels sprouts and garlic, flavored with wine and fresh oregano, is simple enough for a weeknight meal yet sophisticated enough to serve to company. Serve with whole-wheat couscous.\n\nOne-Pot Spinach, Chicken Sausage & Feta Pasta\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA little bit of Sunday meal prep goes a long way in this one-dish pasta recipe. The pasta is cooked ahead of time and stored in the fridge to use for meals all week, but any leftover cooked pasta you have on hand will do. Chicken sausage with feta is especially good in this recipe.\n\nSalmon Pita Sandwich\n--------------------\n\nThis quick lunch recipe is loaded with heart-healthy omega-3s, thanks to the canned sockeye salmon. If you're bringing this sandwich for lunch, keep the salmon salad separate and stuff the pita just before eating.\n\nQuinoa & Chia Oatmeal Mix\n-------------------------\n\nMake your own hot cereal mix with this healthy recipe. Keep it on hand and just cook up the amount you need when you're ready for a hot breakfast. One serving of the warm cereal contains 6 grams of fiber—almost a quarter of your daily quota.\n\nSkillet Lemon Chicken & Potatoes with Kale\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis easy one-pan skillet-roasted lemon chicken is perfect for weeknight dinners. Juicy chicken thighs are cooked in the same pan as baby potatoes and kale for a satisfying meal with the added bonus of minimal cleanup.\n\nCharred Shrimp, Pesto & Quinoa Bowls\n------------------------------------\n\nThese shrimp, pesto and quinoa bowls are delicious, healthy, pretty and take less than 30 minutes to prep. In other words, they're basically the ultimate easy weeknight dinner. Feel free to add additional vegetables and swap the shrimp for chicken, steak, tofu or edamame.\n\nSpinach Ravioli with Artichokes & Olives\n----------------------------------------\n\nStore-bought spinach ravioli and a handful of basic pantry items are all you need to get a healthy dinner on the table in 15 minutes. Ingredients like oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, briny Kalamata olives and toasty pine nuts help to build big flavor fast. If you can't find frozen artichokes, swap in a 15-ounce can (just be sure to drain and rinse them well).\n\nBerry Chia Pudding\n------------------\n\nChia seeds are a good source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids, plus they have fiber, iron and calcium. Here they're mixed with a fruity base and refrigerated until the chia seeds expand to form a thick, creamy texture similar to tapioca. Pudding for breakfast? We're in.\n\nChickpea & Roasted Red Pepper Lettuce Wraps with Tahini Dressing\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA tangy, nutty tahini dressing brings together no-cook ingredients like canned chickpeas and roasted red peppers for these easy meal-prep lettuce wraps. Make these wraps ahead of time for a grab-and-go lunch or dinner. A few wedges of warm pita finish off the meal perfectly.\n\nKung Pao Tofu\n-------------\n\nLaura Kanya; Breana Killeen (Food Styling)\n\nKung pao sauce is typically made with dark soy sauce and sugar—we lightened it up in calories but still kept the dark color by swapping in a touch of molasses. Cooking the tofu and vegetables over high heat means they get crisp on the outside but stay tender in the center.\n\nShrimp, Avocado & Feta Wrap\n---------------------------\n\nThis easy wrap makes a great healthy lunch to pack for work. Buy cooked shrimp in the seafood department at most supermarkets and grocery stores, or check the freezer section for tailed and deveined shrimp that are easy to thaw and steam. Salty feta and chopped fresh vegetables keep this easy lunchtime wrap flavorful and satisfying.\n\nSheet-Pan Roasted Salmon & Vegetables\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis dish is packed with flavor and fits perfectly into a Mediterranean diet.\n\nCucumber Salad, Hummus & Pita Bento Box Lunch\n---------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy this refreshing bento box idea on your lunch break. It combines cucumber salad, hummus, pita and more for a satisfying work lunch.\n\nChicken with Tomato-Balsamic Pan Sauce\n--------------------------------------\n\nFennel seeds give this tomato and balsamic sauce an extra kick, but if you don't have them on hand, try using cumin or coriander seeds, or 1 teaspoon of a ground herb or spice. Serve this easy chicken breast recipe with whole-wheat spaghetti or crusty bread to sop up the sauce.\n\nSpinach & Egg Scramble with Raspberries\n---------------------------------------\n\nJen Causey\n\nThis quick egg scramble with hearty bread is one of the best breakfasts for weight loss. It combines protein-packed eggs and superfood raspberries with filling whole-grain toast and nutrient-rich spinach. The protein and fiber help fill you up and keep you going through the morning.\n\nOne-Pot Tomato Basil Pasta\n--------------------------\n\nThis one-pot pasta with tangy tomato-basil sauce is a simple, fast and easy weeknight dinner. All of your ingredients go into one pot, and with a bit of stirring and about 25 minutes of cook time, you'll have a healthy dinner the whole family will enjoy.\n\nSlow-Cooker Chicken & Chickpea Soup\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe only things better than healthy dinner ideas are easy healthy dinner ideas. This set-it-and-forget-it slow-cooker soup recipe is just that. It simmers away all day so you come home to a warm and healthy dinner the whole family will love. Using bone-in chicken thighs is the key to making rich soup without adding broth. Plus, if you're also in need of healthy meals on a budget, thighs are less expensive than breasts, and dried chickpeas are a relatively inexpensive and versatile pantry item that's always good to stock up on.\n\nFig & Ricotta Overnight Oats\n----------------------------\n\nWith just a bit of work before bed, you can have a fast but special breakfast in the morning. These overnight oats \"cook\" while you sleep. Toast almonds and chop figs the night before so that when you rise, you can just stir in the fruit, nuts, honey and ricotta cheese for a hearty, sweet and creamy breakfast.\n\nChicken & Spinach Skillet Pasta with Lemon & Parmesan\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis one-pan pasta that combines lean chicken breast and sautéed spinach for a one-bowl meal is garlicky, lemony and best served with a little Parm on top.

To make it a full, satisfying dinner, serve over cooked brown rice. When shopping for simmer sauce, look for one with 400 mg of sodium or less and check the ingredient list for cream or fish sauce if you want to keep this vegan. If you like a spicy kick, add a few dashes of your favorite hot sauce at the end.\n\nSheet-Pan Chicken Fajita Bowls\n------------------------------\n\nSkip the tortillas in favor of this warm fajita salad, which features a nutritious medley of chicken with roasted kale, bell peppers and black beans.

Serve over brown rice for an easy healthy dinner that's ready in just 20 minutes.\n\nAir-Fryer Turkey Stuffed Peppers\n--------------------------------\n\nStuffed peppers are a classic family meal—and they're fun to eat, too.

If you're really hungry, mix in farro or brown rice.\n\nRoasted Salmon with Smoky Chickpeas & Greens\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIn this healthy salmon dinner, you'll get a dose of greens and green dressing!

    "markdown": "# Roasted Butternut Squash with Goat Cheese & Pomegranates -\n**_Roasted Butternut Squash combined with goat cheese, pomegranates, and rosemary makes an absolutely delicious, simple, and flavorful dish. It makes a healthy Thanksgiving and holiday side dish or is perfect for weeknight meals for fall and winter. Gluten-free and vegetarian._**\n\n_Last updated on November 12, 2020._\n\n![Bowl filled with roasted butternut squash, goat cheese, pomegranates, and rosemary all mixed together.](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-8.jpg)\n\nThis recipe screams fall and holidays. The butternut squash, the rosemary, the pomegranates, I mean what more can do you want?!\n\nI don’t want to brag, but this roasted butternut squash is so, so good. Maybe one of my favorite side dishes I’ve made. That’s a bold statement, but I just love it.\n\nIt’s sweet and savory, has a little zip from the citrus and balsamic vinegar, and different textures from the goat cheese to the pomegranates. The best part is, it is SO SIMPLE to make. And it will be the star of your Thanksgiving side dishes.\n\nBecause we all know it’s all about the side dishes!\n\nThis roasted butternut squash can actually be enjoyed all fall and winter long though, no holidays needed. It makes the perfect side dish to just about any meal – turkey, pork, chicken, beef, salmon – and is easy to prepare. To save some time, you can use precut butternut squash and prepackaged pomegranate arils from the grocery store.\n\n![Bowl filled with roasted butternut squash, goat cheese, pomegranates, and rosemary all mixed together. It is sitting on a kitchen towel with half a pomegranate and more rosemary next to it.](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-10.jpg)\n\nHow to cut butternut squash\n---------------------------\n\nThere are a few different ways to cut butternut squash, but I find this the easiest way for chopping.\n\n1.  First, chop off both ends of your butternut squash. Then, using a vegetable peeler, peel about the skin. You may need to do it a couple of times over similar areas as the skin is thick.\n2.  Then, lay the squash down on its curvy side and slice widthwise into 1 inch thick rounds. When you get to the bulb, stand it up and cut it in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds.\n3.  Lay a couple of rounds on top of each other and cut into 1-inch pieces. Chop the bulb into the same size pieces.\n\nMake sure you use a sharp knife as it makes a huge difference.\n\nHow to cut a pomegranate\n------------------------\n\nPomegranates are so pretty, but how on earth do you cut them? They can look a little intimating because of the hard shell and all the membrane on the inside once you cut it open, getting out the arils is quite simple.\n\nThere are a few ways to do it, but this is the easiest way for me.\n\n1.  Start by slicing it in half width-wise. Some juice will come out, so make sure you are on a surface that won’t stain. Then, over a bowl filled with water (I like to do this in the sink), break apart the halves into a few pieces with your hands. The seeds will fall down into the bowl.\n2.  Hold the pieces just above or under the water in the bowl and free the arils from the membrane. The white membrane will float to the top while the arils sink, making it easy to separate the two.\n\nYou can also cut it [this way](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23305734/how-to-cut-pomegranate/), but I find that is too many steps with slicing and cutting. But if you like that way better, go for it!\n\nAnd you can always buy pomegranate arils at the grocery store!\n\n![A hand holding half a cut pomegranate over a bowl filled with water](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-4.jpg)\n\nHow to make roasted butternut squash\n------------------------------------\n\nJust 7 simple ingredients to make this flavor-packed roasted butternut squash with goat cheese and pomegranates. Easy to make and an absolutely delicious side dish that goes with any entree, holidays or not!\n\nHere is what you need:\n\n*   butternut squash\n*   goat cheese\n*   pomegranates\n*   fresh rosemary\n*   lemon juice\n*   balsamic vinegar\n*   garlic powder\n*   salt and pepper\n\nFirst, start by prepping your butternut squash. See above for how to chop the butternut squash. Add to a large baking sheet (you may need two depending on how big they are) lined with parchment paper, add your coconut oil, garlic powder, and salt and pepper, and mix well to combine.\n\nI like to mix it up on the baking sheet as it saves me dirtying another dish. Roast butternut squash for 35-40 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit until fork-tender.\n\n![Baking sheet filled with cubed roasted butternut squash.](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-5.jpg)\n\nThen, while the squash bakes, prepare your dressing by mixing together the lemon juice, balsamic, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Next prep your pomegranate seeds (see above for how to cut a pomegranate).\n\nWhen the butternut squash is done, add to a large bowl and pour the dressing overtop. Mix well to combine. Then add your goat cheese and pomegranates and carefully mix well to combine. Top with a little more rosemary if you like.\n\n![Measuring cup filled with chopped rosemary mixed with lemon juice and balsamic vinegar. Next to it is half a lemon and more rosemary.](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-3.jpg)\n\n### Substitutions for roasted butternut squash with goat cheese & pomegranates\n\nWhile this roasted butternut squash is pretty simple and doesn’t call for much, there are a couple of substitutions you could do:\n\n*   **squash** – you could also substitute another kind of winter squash (everything except spaghetti squash), pumpkin, or sweet potatoes if you don’t have butternut squash.\n*   **cheese** – any kind of cheese will work. I would suggest a soft cheese like feta or gorgonzola as a good alternative.\n*   **oil** – I used coconut oil, but any kind of cooking oil will work.\n\n### Additions to this recipe\n\nHere are some things you could add to this dish:\n\n*   **nuts** – pecans or walnuts would be good! Even better if they were a little bit candied!\n*   **dried fruit** – if you like dried fruit in dishes, I think dried cranberries or raisins would work.\n*   **herbs** – you could also add more herbs like thyme, sage, or parsley.\n\n![Overhead shot of a large bowl filled with roasted cubed butternut squash, pomegranates, and goat cheese.](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-6.jpg)\n\nMore healthy holiday side dishes\n--------------------------------\n\n*   [Whole30 Mashed Potatoes](https://eatthegains.com/whole30-mashed-potatoes/)\n*   [Green Beans with Mushrooms and Bacon](https://eatthegains.com/green-beans-with-mushrooms-and-bacon-paleo-whole30/)\n*   [Balsamic Roasted Mushrooms](https://eatthegains.com/balsamic-roasted-mushrooms/)\n*   [Rosemary Roasted Radishes](https://eatthegains.com/rosemary-roasted-radishes/)\n*   [Homemade Cranberry Sauce](https://eatthegains.com/homemade-cranberry-sauce/)\n\n![Overhead shot of a bowl filled with a simple butternut squash salad.](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-9.jpg)\n\n![Bowl filled with roasted butternut squash, goat cheese, pomegranates, and rosemary all mixed together.](https://eatthegains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-8-150x150.jpg)\n\nRoasted Butternut Squash with Goat Cheese & Pomegranates\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Roasted butternut squash combined with goat cheese, pomegranates, and rosemary makes an absolutely delicious, simple, and flavorful dish.

With plenty of mini pumpkins already on hand, I thought about what delicious combination of flavors to stuff inside them. Sausage, sweet onion, mushrooms, pecans, cranberries, kale, Parmigiano-Reggiano, seasonal spices, and of course, rice came together for a flavor combination that’s quintessentially fall.\n\n![Sausage, Rice, and Cranberry Mini Stuffed Pumpkins | inspiredbycharm.com](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rice-Sausage-Cranberry-Stuffed-Mini-Pumpkins-681x1024.jpg)\n\nNow stuff all of that goodness into a mini pumpkin, and what’s not to love?\n\nWhile combining all of these flavors is bound to be delicious, this dish also wins on presentation.

This recipe combines sweet, spicy, and smoky flavors to create a seriously flavorful chicken bowl! The chipotle chicken marinade is quick and easy to make and goes beautifully with the sweet corn salsa and buttery avocados.\n\n![honey chipotle chicken bowls with brown rice, avocados, and corn salsa](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-1-710x1065.jpg)\n\nThat is some serious flavor right there!\n\nWe’re talking about chicken marinated in a honey chipotle mixture that’s slightly sweet, smoky, with a hint of spice, and nothing short of flavorful. It also happens to be one of the best things you can meal prep because it tastes better as it sits.\n\nWe’ll start by marinating the chicken and letting it hang out. This recipe is perfect to make on an outdoor grill in the summertime and equally delicious made on an indoor grill pan when you’re living in a tundra in the middle of winter. The marinade for this recipe is inspired by Chipotle’s vinaigrette recipe. We’ve just played around with the quantities to create a marinade rather than a dressing.\n\nThe sweet corn salsa is also inspired by Chipotle’s corn, which is totally a fiesta in your mouth. I start charring off a poblano pepper – totally optional. I know some people don’t mind the skin, but if I’m going to make this thing, I’m going to do it right. And then, we add in a squeeze of lemon juice, lime juice, a minced jalapeño, and lots of red onions. You can scoop it up with a tortilla chip, or you can serve it on top of this bowl; either way – it’s fantastic.\n\nServe it all up on a bed of your favorite rice, quinoa, or grains with slices of buttery avocados. And if you’re about to ask, doesn’t it need a sauce? You could totally do one, but honestly, it’s so flavorful that nope, we actually didn’t need one!\n\nA flavor explosion is coming at you in 3..2…1\n\n![honey chipotle diced chicken over rice](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-3-710x1065.jpg)\n\nIngredients for honey chipotle chicken bowls\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Chicken:** I used boneless skinless chicken thighs for this recipe because that’s what I had on hand. But usually, I prefer to use chicken breasts for my bowls. Needless to say, thighs, breasts, and tenders – any protein cut works for this bowl.\n*   **Chipotle Peppers:** I use a can of chipotles that are packed in adobo sauce. You’ll need 1-2 peppers for this recipe, depending on how much heat you want the recipe to have. We usually veer on the side of caution and go with one chipotle pepper, and it’s perfect that way. You’ll also want 1 tablespoons adobo sauce.\n*   **Olive oil:** You’ll need a bit of olive oil to add to the marinade. Since the marinade contains plenty of oil, I usually don’t spray my grill pan before cooking the chicken.\n*   **Red Wine Vinegar:** Goes into the chipotle marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Honey:** Adds a hint of sweetness to the marinade.\n*   **Seasonings:** You’ll need onion powder, oregano, salt, and peppers. Most of these will go into the marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Corn:** I like to use a bag of frozen corn that I’ll just zap in the microwave. Fresh corn that you char on the grill would be a dream if you’re making this during the summer. It’s one of my favorite additons to this [salad](https://littlespicejar.com/charred-corn-avocado-salad/).\n*   **Onions and Garlic:** Red onions go into the corn salsa, and the garlic is for the marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Peppers and cilantro:** I use a couple of different kinds of peppers. You’ll need a small poblano pepper and a jalapeño pepper. I usually remove all the ribs and seeds from the jalapeño before mincing it up. You’ll also want to char your poblano and remove the skin. This is optional, but I do think it gives the salsa a smokey, delicious flavor! You’ll also need a handful of cilantro to add to the corn salsa.\n*   **Lemon and Limes:** You’ll need both lemons and limes to add to the corn salsa.\n*   **Base and Toppings:** You’ll need cooked rice, quinoa, or your favorite grains to make the bowl. You’ll also need ripe avocados that are diced or sliced. I used regular fluffed brown rice, but you could also make this with [cilantro lime rice](https://littlespicejar.com/cilantro-lime-rice/) or [Mexican rice](https://littlespicejar.com/mexican-rice/) for more flavor!\n\n![chicken in marinade and grilled chicken](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-2-710x532.jpg)\n\n![corn salsa in bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\nHow to make honey chipotle chicken bowls\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Start with the marinade.** Add the minced chipotle peppers, adobo, vinegar, honey, oil, garlic, onion powder, oregano, salt, and pepper to a jar and shake or whisk it to combine. Pour the marinade over the chicken and let sit for at little as 30 minutes and, ideally, around 4 hours.\n2.  **Char the peppers.** While the chicken is marinating, you’ll want to cook the rice or grains; you’ll also want to char the peppers and prepare the corn salsa. Place the poblano over an open flame on the stove and keep a close eye on it. You’ll hear the pepper start to pop. The heat blisters the skin, chars, and loosens it. Keep cooking until charred all over. Then place it in a bowl and cover with a lid for 10 minutes before you peel it with a spoon. Then mince the pepper.\n3.  **Make corn salsa.** Add the defrosted corn, minced poblano, jalapeño, cilantro, red onions, lemon, and lime juice to a bowl. Stir to combine and season with a pinch of salt. Cover and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve the bowls.\n4.  **Cook the chicken.** Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook them for 8-10 minutes, flipping the chicken in the skillet around the halfway mark. When the chicken is done, remove it to a cutting board and let it rest for several minutes before you slice or dice it.\n5.  **Assemble and serve.** Serve up the fluffy rice, tender quinoa, or grains in a bowl topped with diced chicken, a scoop of corn salsa, and slices of avocado. And feel free to top it with chopped tomatoes, hot sauce, [pickled onions](https://littlespicejar.com/quick-pickled-onions/), or other fresh veggies!\n\n![chipotle chicken, rice avocados and corn salsa in bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-8-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### FAQs about this recipe\n\n****Are honey chipotle chicken bowls a good recipe for meal prep?**​**\n\nYes! The chicken is uber-flavorful and will easily last in the refrigerator for 4 days. I recommend placing the chicken and rice in [containers](https://amzn.to/3vFwJA6) and keeping the corn salsa separate. Add the corn salsa and the avocado to each bowl right before serving.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Honey Harissa Chicken Bowls](https://littlespicejar.com/honey-harissa-chicken-bowls/)\n*   [Steak Fajita Bowls with Garlic Lime Rice](https://littlespicejar.com/steak-fajita-bowls/)\n*   [​Beef Birria de Res](https://littlespicejar.com/birria-de-res/)\n*   [Mexican Street Corn Chicken Tacos](https://littlespicejar.com/mexican-street-corn-chicken-tacos/)\n*   [Creamy Mexican Corn Dip](https://littlespicejar.com/creamy-mexican-corn-dip-elotes-dip/)\n\n![hand holding bowl with chicken and toppings](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-9-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![honey chipotle chicken bowls with brown rice, avocados, and corn salsa](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-1-735x1103.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Bowls:\n\n*   1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken (thighs/breasts/tenders)\n*   1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (plus 1 tbsp adobo)\n*   1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar\n*   1 tablespoon honey\n*   3 tablespoons olive oil\n*   2 small garlic cloves, minced\n*   ½ teaspoon EACH: onion powder AND dried oregano\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   ¼ teaspoon pepper\n*   2 ½ cups prepared rice, quinoa, or grains\n*   Lime wedges and cilantro, for serving\n*   Slices avocados, for serving\n\n#### Corn Salsa:\n\n*   1 (16-ounce) bag frozen corn\n*   ⅓ cup red onion, finely chopped\n*   1 large poblano pepper, charred, peeled and finely chopped\n*   1 jalapeño pepper, finely minced\n*   ¼ cup cilantro, chopped\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon juice AND lime juice\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **COMBINE:** Mince the chipotle peppers finely and add to a mason jar.

Stuffed pumpkins like this are basically like a healthier versions of a bread bowl (one of my personal favorite indulgences). The filling in the pumpkin bowls, with a mix of Gruyère cheese, stale bread, sautéed vegetables and ground turkey, is like a savory bread pudding.\n\nAs you eat the stuffed pumpkins, scrape the sweet flesh from the sides of the roasted pumpkin shell and devour each bite of the filling for an all-in-one twist on thanksgiving dinner. This version of Thanksgiving food is perfect for smaller holiday gatherings where roasting a whole turkey may not make sense. You still get all the holiday flavors in this dish throughout the stuffed pumpkin recipe without the day-long prep.\n\nGround Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffed Pumpkins\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### Table of contents\n\n*   [Ground Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffing Filled Roasted Mini Pumpkins](#h-ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins)\n    *   [Key Ingredients in This Recipe](#h-key-ingredients-in-this-recipe)\n    *   [How to Make Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffing Filled Roast Pumpkins](#h-how-to-make-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roast-pumpkins)\n    *   [Tips and Tricks for This Recipe](#h-tips-and-tricks-for-this-recipe)\n    *   [Other Recipes to Try](#h-other-recipes-to-try)\n\n[![small sugar pie pumpkin baguette celery sage and yellow onions](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_6039524d4b1cf.jpg)](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/2017-ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins/ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins-ingredients-shot/)\n\n### Key Ingredients in This Recipe\n\n*   **Pumpkin –** “Sugar”, “sugar pie” or “pie pumpkins” are the best types of pumpkins to use for baking. Larger varieties used for carving often have a much tougher texture and lack the sweetness of the smaller pumpkins. It acts as both the vessel and additional vegetables.\n*   **Turkey –** Ground turkey is typically made from both light and dark meat. The ground turkey in this stuffed pumpkin recipe can be swapped with ground chicken or pork though it’s not as seasonal.\n*   **Mirepoix –** A combination of carrots, celery and onion are sautéed to create the flavorful base of stuffing. This combination is referred to as sofrito in Italian and is often called a mirepoix in French cooking.\n*   **Sage –** The chopped fresh sage leaves are fried in butter to add a nutty and more complex flavor to the filling.\n*   **Gruyère cheese** – Gruyère is a hard cheese with a nutty, sweet flavor from Switzerland. The fact that it melts well (due to a high water to oil ratio) mixed with t’s distinct flavor makes it the perfect addition to anything from sandwiches to mac and cheese or fondue. If you can’t find Gruyère, I recommend substituting with another Swiss cheese like Emmental.\n\n### How to Make Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffed Pumpkins\n\n![cut open sugar pie pumpkins with seeds scooped out](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-4-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 1: Cut pumpkins.\n\nPreheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Turn each pumpkin on its side, and use a sharp knife to slice the top, including the stem, off the pumpkin, about 1-inch down. Use a spoon to remove the seeds and discard or reserve for another use.\n\n##### Step 2: Roast pumpkins. \n\nRub the inside of the pumpkins with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper then arrange the pumpkins and cut off tops on a baking sheet. Roast until the meat is soft, about 35 minutes. Set aside.\n\n![roasted sugar pumpkins with tops cut off and scooped out on baking sheet](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-19-683x1024.webp)\n\n![sautéed carrots, onions and celery in cast iron skillet](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-11-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 3: Sauté vegetables. \n\nHeat a large sauté pan over medium-low heat, add the remaining oil and heat through. Add the carrots, onion and celery and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes.\n\n##### Step 4: Cook the turkey. \n\nAdd the ground turkey to the pan and sauté, stirring occasionally and using a wooden spoon to break up any large pieces, until the meat is browned, about 5 minutes.

Try this parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower! It’s got lots of flavor from the pesto and a nice salty bite from the parmesan cheese. Plus, you only need four ingredients to make it!_\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a plate with a bowl of pesto.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-photos.jpg)\n\n_This recipe and photos have been updated since the original post on 2/22/2017_\n\nThere’s about a 50/50 chance you’ll get a side dish with dinner at our house. If we have company there’s a good chance you’ll get one, but if it’s just me and my husband not so much. \n\nI have been trying to be better about it. My go-to side dish is generally some kind of roasted vegetable, like these [chili honey lime roasted brussels sprouts](https://reciperunner.com/chili-honey-lime-roasted-brussels-sprouts/) or this [sweet and spicy roasted butternut squash](https://reciperunner.com/sweet-spicy-roasted-butternut-squash/).\n\nWhatever side dish I’m making it has to be easy and something that will taste good the next day so I can repurpose it with another meal. This parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower checks both of those boxes and the flavor is next level!\n\n ![ingredients for Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-ingredients-photo.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients For Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Cauliflower\n*   Pesto\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Lemon\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower with a bowl of pesto with a spoon in it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-photographs.jpg)\n\nThis side dish couldn’t be easier to make. Start by preheating your oven to 400° F. Rinse and dry the head of cauliflower and then cut out the core. Break it down into florets and put them on a rimmed sheet pan.\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with any cleanup, line your sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Lay the cauliflower florets onto the sheet pan. \n\nDollop on 3 or 4 tablespoons of pesto depending on how large your head of cauliflower was. Sprinkle with salt and pepper as well. \n\nUse clean hands to toss the cauliflower until all the florets are coated with pesto. Spread them out into a single layer and make sure there is some space in between them. This will allow them to brown and caramelize rather than steam.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-process-photo.jpg)\n\nRoast the pesto cauliflower for 10 minutes and then remove it from the oven. Use a spatula to toss it around and then sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Roast for another another 12-15 minutes or until it’s tender and caramelized.\n\nRemove it from the oven and squeeze the juice of half of a lemon all over it. Put it on a serving platter or in a bowl. I like to scrape up any of the crispy parmesan cheese that’s stuck to the pan and add it in. \n\nDollop on additional pesto and sprinkle on extra parmesan cheese if you’d like. \n\n ![spoon drizzling pesto on top of Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-picture.jpg)\n\n**Tips For Roasting Cauliflower**\n---------------------------------\n\n*   Roast the cauliflower at a high heat. I like to roast mine at 400° F., but you can also roast at 425° F. Just keep an eye on it as it likely won’t take as long to roast.\n*   Slice the cauliflower so that there are plenty of flat edges. Make sure the flat edges are in contact with the bottom of the pan. This will ensure that they get golden brown and caramelized on that side.\n*   Don’t overcrowd the pan. If the cauliflower is too close together or on top of each other it will steam and won’t get any of the crisp edges or caramelization.\n*   Be sure the cauliflower is completely coated in oil or in this case pesto. Pesto contains olive oil which is why I didn’t add any additional oil to this recipe. \n*   Flip the florets over with a spatula halfway through the cooking time. This will help to caramelize more surface area of the florets.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto.

    "markdown": "# Blackberry Salad (With a Poppyseed Dressing) - Chelsea's Messy Apron\n_Show-stopping **Blackberry Salad** is brimming with juicy blackberries(of course!), sweet candied pecans, crisp pears, salty feta cheese, and a homemade creamy poppy seed dressing._\n\n ![Blackberry salad with a light drizzle of poppy seed dressing, ready to be savored.](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blackberry-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nBlackberry Salad is a stunning dish that tastes every bit as amazing as it looks! It’s got all the right flavors, textures, and the perfect creamy dressing to finish it all off. \n\nWe enjoy this salad as a side dish, but it can be made into a main course meal by adding in some protein. Grilled and chopped chicken, thinly sliced steak, or even some lentils or quinoa would add plenty of protein and make it filling enough for a full meal. In fact, one of our favorite ways to enjoy Blackberry Salad is with some shredded rotisserie chicken added in.\n\n ![Ingredients being added into a blender jar, processed until smooth, with poppy seeds mixed in, and the final dressing being poured.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad tips\n---------------------\n\n*   When serving Blackberry Salad for a party, event, or holiday meal, I recommend **making the candied pecans and dressing a day or two in advance**. This makes the final assembly a breeze! It’s also a good idea so the pecans have sufficient time to harden and the dressing has a chance to thoroughly chill and for the flavors to intensify.\n*   Use a **good mayonnaise for the dressing–** the better the mayo, the better the dressing will taste. I love Hellman’s/Best Foods® (not sponsored) since it has a rich flavor without being too sweet or tangy.\n*   If you aren’t able to find **fresh or ripe pears** at the store, use whole canned pears and drain them. Thinly slice and use in the salad.\n*   Speaking of ripe pears, you can **test a pear for ripeness** by applying gentle pressure near the stem end. If there is a slight give, it is most likely ready to be sliced and added to the salad. And if you can’t smell any sweet pear-ness, it probably isn’t ready to use.\n*   If you have a fresh lemon on hand, squeeze a bit of **lemon juice on the pear to keep it from browning too quickly**. [Here are a few more tips for preparing the pears](https://usapears.org/pear-ripening-and-handling/).\n\n ![Thin slices of pears and fresh blackberries prepared for a salad, with added feta cheese, leading to the salad's final assembly.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow to use leftover candied pecans\n----------------------------------\n\nSince it’s a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly halve the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nHere are some of our favorite ways to use up leftover pecans from this Blackberry Salad:\n\n*   As a **snack**/**dessert**: Enjoy them plain or coarsely chopped as a topping for a [Yogurt Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/top-10-favorite-ways-top-yogurt-bowl/) or an [Acai Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/acai-bowl/)\n*   **In these sweet** **recipes**: [Carrot Cake](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-carrot-cake/) or [Carrot Cake Cupcakes](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/carrot-cake-cupcakes/)\n*   **In these savory** **recipes**: [Pear Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-pear-pomegranate-salad/), [Butternut Squash Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/butternut-squash-salad/), our favorite [Berry Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/berry-salad-with-a-raspberry-vinaigrette/), or this Fall [Spinach Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spinach-salad/). \n*   **By replacing the regular pecans for candied pecans in these recipes**: [Chicken Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-salad/), [Mexican Wedding Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/mexican-wedding-cookies/), or these [Chocolate Chip Snowball Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chocolate-chip-snowball-cookies/)\n\nYou can store leftover pecans in the freezer (in an airtight container) for up to 2 months. They only need 10-15 minutes at room temperature to thaw enough to eat. (At room temperature, candied pecans last for up to 2 weeks stored in a cool and dry space.)\n\n ![Blackberry salad featuring a drizzle of poppy seed dressing over a mix of blackberries, nuts, greens, and cheese.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad storage\n------------------------\n\nBlackberry Salad doesn’t sit or store well once dressed. Once you assemble it, plan to eat it soon; otherwise, the dressing wilts the lettuce, the pears begin to brown, and the pecans soften.\n\nIf you make Blackberry Salad in advance, store all the components separately. Slice the pear and assemble the salad right before eating.\n\nMore salad recipes\n------------------\n\n*   [Beet and Goat Cheese Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/beet-and-goat-cheese-salad/) _with an orange-honey vinaigrette_\n*   [Olive Garden Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spiralized-cucumber-salad-with-olive-garden-dressing-copycat-video/) _with an Italian vinaigrette_\n*   [Chicken Taco Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-taco-salad/) _with a cilantro-lime vinaigrette_\n*   [Cucumber Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/cucumber-salad/) _with a balsamic vinaigrette_\n*   [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/) _on a spring Cobb salad_\n\n### Salad\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups (5 oz) spring lettuce mix (8 cups is loosely measured)\n*   ▢ 1 package (6 oz.) fresh blackberries\n*   ▢ 2 Anjou pears, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup chopped candied pecans (recipe for a full batch below)\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup crumbled goat or feta cheese\n\n### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup regular (full fat) mayo (I recommend Best Foods/Hellmans)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons EACH: whole milk, heavy cream, white granulated sugar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n*   ▢ pinch of sea salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds\n\n### Candied Pecans (Note 1)\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup white sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n*   ▢ 1 large egg white\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon water\n*   ▢ 1 pound pecan halves\n\n#### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   Combine all of the dressing ingredients, except the poppy seeds, in a blender and process until combined. Taste and adjust any flavors to personal preference. If you'd like a sweeter dressing, add an additional 1-2 teaspoons white sugar. Stir in the poppy seeds. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to serve. (Dressing stays good for 1 week stored in an airtight container in the fridge.)\n    \n\n#### Candied Pecans\n\n*   Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the white sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Stir to combine.\n    \n*   In another bowl, whisk the egg whites, vanilla, and water until frothy. Toss the pecans into this mixture and then remove, using a slotted spoon. Put the nuts into the sugar mixture and toss until well coated. Spread coated pecans onto a baking sheet.\n    \n*   Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are evenly browned. This takes about 45-60 minutes total. Let stand for 30-45 minutes to allow the pecans to fully cool and solidify. Coarsely chop for the salad.\n    \n\n#### For the Salad\n\n*   In a large salad bowl, toss together the spring lettuce mix and fresh (washed and completely dried) blackberries. Thinly slice pears. Add to the salad.\n    \n*   Add the chopped candied pecans, goat or feta cheese, and the dressing. (You may not want all of the dressing on the salad, so add to personal preference.) Toss and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Note 1**: Prep/cook time doesn't include the preparation of the candied pecans.\n\nSince it's a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly half the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nServing: 8servings | Calories: 181kcal | Carbohydrates: 15.7g | Protein: 2.2g | Fat: 13g | Cholesterol: 12.1mg | Sodium: 134.8mg | Fiber: 2.6g | Sugar: 12.4g\n\nWe do our best to provide accurate nutritional analysis for our recipes.

    "markdown": "# 10-Minute Peach & Burrata Salad - Well Seasoned Studio\nIf there’s one dish we have on repeat all summer long, it’s for sure this light, refreshing **peach burrata salad!** Stone fruit season lasts roughly from June till September, so make this as often as you can — even though peaches are available year round in most places, they are **sweetest and juiciest** while in season! **Combine fresh peaches with room temperature burrata cheese** (room temp is key!) **and thinly sliced prosciutto**. This on its own would be heaven, but we’re adding **truffle oil** which makes this a next level peach salad, m’kay!\n\nHere’s why we love this salad so much:\n\n*   Makes for an **easy, light lunch!** It won’t weigh you down, but is so completely satisfying you’ll want to enjoy it every day!\n*   **No cooking required!** We adore a no cook lunch, especially when we’re busy.\n*   **Flavorrrr!** Fresh peaches, creamy burrata cheese, and silky prosciutto — when combined together, well… _swoon!_ Because there are so few ingredients, buy high quality for the best flavor.\n*   **Truffle oil!** Adding a drizzle of truffle oil to the salad is the perfect _je ne sais quoi_ that brings the ingredients together harmoniously. Finish it all off with flaky sea salt and black pepper, and you’ve got one hell of a salad!\n\nBe sure to try our [Grilled Peach Salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-peach-salad/) next or check out all our **[easy salad recipes](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/recipes/salad/).** If you’ve got any leftover peaches, give our [Peach Crumble](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/peach-crumble/) a try for dessert!\n\n![Ingredients for peach burrata truffle salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ingredients-for-peach-burrata-truffle-salad-683x1024.jpeg)\n\nIngredient Notes\n----------------\n\n*   Ripe peaches, _either freestone or clingstone_\n*   Burrata cheese, _room temperature_\n*   Prosciutto (_optional, but highly recommended!_)\n*   [Truffle oil](https://amzn.to/3xtHbcG)\n*   Basil\n*   [Flaky sea salt](https://amzn.to/3gDkoV0)\n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n\nYou can use any type of peach you like best (or just grab whatever is ripe and smells sweetest at the store!). When you’re making a dish with so few ingredients, it’s important to select high quality items. Make sure the peaches aren’t bruised or discolored. Buy fresh, creamy burrata cheese. And if you can get prosciutto from an Italian deli (or even behind the deli counter!), it’ll be 10x better than what comes in a package.\n\n![How to assemble a peach salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/How-to-assemble-a-peach-salad-1024x1020.jpg)\n\nHow To Make An Epic Peach Burrata Salad\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cut the peaches.** If using a **freestone peach**, use a knife to cut all the way around the fruit, ensuring that the knife is touching the pit the entire time. Use your hands to separate the halves from each other, then gently lift away the pit and discard. Cut each peach halve into slices about ½” thick. If using a **clingstone peach**, you’ll cut the peach the same way, but the pit will be more stubborn to remove. Use a [paring knife](https://amzn.to/3q5nQMx) to help separate the pit from the flesh of the peach, then pull the pit out and discard.\n2.  **Arrange the prosciutto.** Rip the prosciutto into small pieces, then arrange nestled in between the peaches.\n3.  **Rip the burrata.** Use your hands to gently tear the burrata into small bite size pieces, being careful to keep a bit of the creamy filling with each bite. Scatter around the plate.\n4.  **Season the salad.** Drizzle the entirely plate lightly with about 1 Tbsp of truffle oil (a little goes a long way), then season the peach slices and burrata with flaky sea salt and black pepper. Garnish with a few fresh basil leaves, then serve immediately.\n\n![Peach and burrata salad with prosciutto on a gray plate with fork.](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Peach-and-burrata-salad-with-prosciutto-on-a-gray-plate-with-fork.jpg)\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n**Freestone vs Clingstone peaches — what’s the difference?**\n\nThis refers to how much the fruit clings to the stone, or pit, of the peach. Freestone peaches have pits that easily life away, while clingstone peaches hold onto the pit more. For a sweet peach that you can eat out of hand, look for a **freestone.** Once exposed, the put will fall away easily. **Clingstone,** however, are sweeter and juicier!\n\n**What is burrata cheese?**\n\nIt’s a soft cow’s milk cheese that looks deceptively like mozzarella. In fact, that’s what the outer layer is! The inside is filled with straciatella and cream, and has a luxurious soft, wet texture. Check out our [braised beef pappardelle](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/braised-beef-pappardelle/), [burrata pizza](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/burrata-pizza/), and [grilled potato salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-potato-salad/), all featuring our favorite cheese: burrata!\n\n**Can I use mozzarella in place of burrata?**\n\nMozzarella won’t have the same creamy texture, but of course you can use it! We recommend tearing a freshly made ball of mozzarella into small bite size pieces. The pre-shredded or packaged cheeses won’t be as good here.\n\n**Truffle oil is expensive. Can I use something else?**\n\nThe truffle oil is really the signature flavor of this dish, so we think it’s worth it. If you don’t like or can’t find truffle oil, replace with a generous drizzle of a high quality finishing oil. [This](https://amzn.to/3iWPOsp) is our favorite!\n\n![Peach salad with basil and prosciutto on a plate](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Peach-salad-with-basil-and-prosciutto-on-a-plate-683x1024.jpg)\n\n**[Don’t forget to pin this for later!](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/24699497946669429/)**\n\nNot sure how many times we need to say this, but _damn,_ is this salad amazing!

    "markdown": "# Strawberry Salad - Strawberry Crunch Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette\nSay hello to the most delicious summery strawberry salad!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-9.jpg)\n\nThis strawberry crunch salad is going to be theeeee most made salad in my kitchen this year. I think. I mean, I have a lot of salads that I love, and even more coming to you this season. But if you’re a strawberry freak like I am, you will adorrrrreee this bowl. \n\nIt’s fresh, savory, creamy and crunchy. Ideal for what I require in a salad!\n\n![strawberries](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/strawberry-trifle-10.jpg)\n\nRemember [my blueberry (crunch) salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) that I shared last year? It was such a huge hit all summer and I knew I had to make a strawberry salad version. Where that one is a bit simpler, this one has more substance and could totally be a lunch salad because it’s incredibly satisfying.\n\nOn the same note, it’s still a salad that you could serve as a starter to dinner. It definitely works! \n\n![strawberry crunch salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-3.jpg)\n\nIf I’ve rambled about anything (everything?) on this blog, it’s that I.love.texture. Not even that I love texture, but I NEED texture. Especially in my salads. I can’t tell you how often I google “crunchy things for salads” when throwing together a house salad for dinner. It’s imperative for my mental and emotional and physical eating state.\n\n### Very important, clearly.\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-7.jpg)\n\nSo because of that, I like to use two varieties of nuts here. First, we’re making the sugared almonds from [the blueberry salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) because they are so fantastic. I highly suggest you don’t leave these out. They MAKE the dish. And they are easy too. You have to keep an eye on them but you can also prep them ahead of time. You can see me make them on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/howsweeteats/) today!\n\nThen on the flip side, I like to use roasted, salted pistachios. A sweet nut and a savory nut. Pistachios are one of my favorites – so buttery and rich. Having both nuts in the salad adds such a wonderful layer of crunch and flavor.\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-14.jpg)\n\nNext, the creamy avocado and goat cheese! I love using both of these too – the avocado is mild and the goat cheese is tangy. You can also sub in feta or leave out the cheese entirely if you don’t like goat. \n\nI love how the goat cheese melts into the whole salad when it’s tossed. It’s always my favorite part of goat cheese in a salad!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-15.jpg)\n\n### Finally, the strawberries!\n\nLeave them in halves or quarter them – or chop. Whatever you wish. I love that we are entering full blown strawberry season where they taste like actual candy. I’m also wondering how old that makes me sound, because when adults used to tell me that strawberries taste like candy when I was a kid, I’d look at them like they had ten heads.\n\nOf course, I’ve said this to Max and Emilia recently and while strawberries probably rank as one of their favorite foods, they do NOT think they are candy. Ha.\n\nI love to use a champagne vinaigrette on this salad because it’s still tangy and briney, but mild at the same time. It’s not quite as strong as red wine or apple cider vinegar. It adds a nice savory contrast to the salad, but still lets the other ingredients shine. The best dressing, in my opinion! Of course, feel free to use another one that you love here. The [creamy balsamic from my blueberry salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) would also be incredible. \n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-11.jpg)\n\nCan’t get enough of this beauty!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-5.jpg)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStrawberry Saladwith Champagne Vinaigrette\n------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-9-250x250.jpg)\n\nStrawberry Crunch Salad\n-----------------------\n\nYield: 4 people\n\nPrep Time: 25 minutes\n\nCook Time: 5 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 30 minutes\n\nThis strawberry salad is the best spring and summer meal!

Transfer the almonds to a piece of parchment paper to let them cool. Break them into pieces if they are clumped.\n    \n*   Toss the arugula with a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl.

    "markdown": "# Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - Homemade Home\n_**Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute** is a gorgeous and super simple appetizer for a get-together. This baked brie recipe is made in puff pastry and baked! You can bet this won’t go unnoticed!_\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-2-e1638987884244.jpg)\n\nWell, _none_ of this week’s “How Big Is The Kid?!” baking experiment is unfortunate. It’s cheese wrapped in carbs. And then baked until molten and golden brown.\n\nPraise the sugar gods for keeping my numbers in cheese, because I admit that I ate about half of this wheel of cheese while shooting it. Huck, the dog, also got his fair share when I wasn’t looking…\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-3-e1638987896658.jpg)\n\nLike mother like son. And the human son was also quite pleased with how this turned out, if his kicks to my lungs were any indication.\n\nAccording to my pregnancy app (I use Ovia Pregnancy for anyone curious), they say at 30 weeks he was the size of a brie en croute.\n\nI can only assume that they meant a much larger wheel of brie than the mini 8 ounce version I baked up for this – but let’s be honest, I probably didn’t need a full one pound wheel baked in puff pastry just laying around the house… Need is different than want.\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-4-e1638987905677.jpg)\n\nI sure as hell WANTED a full wheel just laying around the house. But such is life.  \n\nSummer is in full swing in Seattle – with over 40 days of NO RAIN. Two good things are coming out of that, one being that my tomatoes are absolutely thriving, and two that our blackberries are finally getting the clue that it is time to ripen.\n\nAnd they are really taking that clue seriously.\n\nOur little street is packed with berries, some ripe and ready to pick, and others still green so I will have a good rotation of berries to pick the rest of summer.\n\nHuck is a champion blackberry picker and gets his own low hanging berries right from the prickly vines. In 20 minutes we cleaned house, picking some of the most delicious, warm blackberries for this recipe (and a pie I promised Ben). Only one brush with stinging nettles stymied me – which is a victory in itself since I was out there in shorts and a tank top ambling through the brambles. \\*Slow clap\\*.\n\nWhat is this Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute recipe best served with?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI like to use crackers or bread crisps! Anything sturdy to scoop and eat!\n\nYou can serve baked brie with sturdy crackers, bread crisps, or as part of a fruit and veggie tray as well.\n\nCan I take the thyme out of this Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute recipe?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-e1638987923603.jpg)\n\nThe thyme was a lovely savory component to the sweetness of the berries. And I 11/10 recommend. But if you want a sweet baked brie, you can omit it from this Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute and it is still divine.  \n\nNeed to catch up on our progress for this kiddo? See what other baked treats he’s been in the past few weeks!!\n\n[**Week 25 – Chocolate Tiramisu Swiss Roll**](https://homemadehome.com/2017/06/chocolate-tiramisu-swiss-roll.html)\n\n![Chocolate Tiramisu Swiss Roll](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Chocolate-Tiramisu-Swiss-Roll-3-e1638987952888.jpg)\n\n[**Week 20 – Orange Crepe Suzette**](https://homemadehome.com/2017/06/crepe-suzette.html)\n\n![Crepe Suzette - Orange Crepes with Orange Butter Filling](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Crepe-Suzette-Orange-Crepes-with-Orange-Butter-Filling-e1614884823474.jpg)\n\nNeed More Inspired Homemade Recipes To Try?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**[Lemon Thyme Biscotti](https://homemadehome.com/lemon-thyme-biscotti/)**\n\n**[Roasted Tomato Brie Dip](https://homemadehome.com/roasted-tomato-brie-dip/)**\n\n**[Sausage Apricot and Brie Mac and Cheese](https://homemadehome.com/sausage-and-apricot-brie-mac-and-cheese/)**\n\n**[Blackberry Sorbet](https://homemadehome.com/blackberry-sorbet/)**\n\n**[Perfect Every Time Blackberry Peach Pie](https://homemadehome.com/perfect-every-time-blackberry-peach-pie/)**\n\n[Print](https://homemadehome.com/blackberry-thyme-baked-brie-en-croute/print/26276/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\nFluffy and crispy puff pastry wrapped around melted brie cheese with fresh blackberries is a delightful summer appetizer!\n\n* * *\n\n*   1 Sheet Puff Pastry, thawed\n*   1/2 pound Brie Cheese\n*   1 Egg + 1 Tbsp Water\n*   1 cup Fresh Blackberries\n*   2–3 Tbsp Blackberry Jam\n*   1 Tbsp Fresh Thyme\n*   1/8 tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n* * *\n\nPreheat oven to 400 Degrees.\n\nRoll out the puff pastry into a 12×12 inch square. Cut three small 1/4″ strips from three sides of the puff pastry and set those aside. You will braid them together for a decorative topping.\n\nGently cut the top rind off the brie cheese and discard. Top the cut side of the brie with blackberries, and drizzle with the blackberry jam. Sprinkle on thyme, and black pepper. Lay the puff pastry over the top of the cheese and berries. Before you fold the puff pastry under the cheese, brush the edges of the puff pastry with a mixture of egg and water. This will glue the pastry together. Fold the puff pastry under the brie and seal.\n\nBrush the rest of the puff pastry with the egg wash. Braid the three strips of the remaining puff pastry and set it on top of the en croute. Brush this with egg wash.\n\nBake for 30-35 minutes, or until dark golden brown. Remove and serve with crackers, or bread crisps.\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n\\*Note – you can use a full pound wheel of brie, there is plenty of puff pastry to accommodate it if desired.\\*\n\nThis site contains affiliate links, if you make a purchase through them, we receive a small commission."

We eat a lot of salads during the hot summer months and I want the salads to be hearty because a salad is usually our meal, with watermelon on the side. We always have watermelon:)\n\nHow to Make Grilled Chicken Salad\n---------------------------------\n\n*   In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, honey, mustard, garlic, poppy seeds, salt, and black pepper.\n*   Pour half of the dressing into a large Ziploc bag or bowl. Reserve the rest for drizzling on the salads. Add the chicken breasts and marinate the chicken for 20 minutes. If you have time, you can let the chicken marinade for up to 2 hours.\n*   Heat the grill to medium high heat. Remove the chicken from the bag or bowl and place on the grill. Cook for 6-8 minutes on each side or until chicken is cooked through. Note-discard the dressing that the chicken was in.

Slice the grilled chicken and place on top of the salads. Drizzle with remaining lemon poppy seed dressing and serve immediately.\n\nSalad Tips\n----------\n\n*   The lemon poppy seed dressing serves as a dressing and marinade for the chicken. It is easy to whisk up and adds a lot of flavor to the chicken and salad. You can marinate the chicken for 20 minutes or you can prepare it in advance and let it marinate for a few hours in the fridge.\n*   You can grill the chicken on an outside grill or on a grill pan inside.\n*   If you want the salad to be vegetarian, you can leave the chicken off of the salad. That is what I do and the salad is still super delicious.\n*   This summer salad is great for lunch or dinner. It is filling enough to be a main dish.\n\nHappy summer, friends!

    "markdown": "# Crockpot Chicken Fajitas + VIDEO - Fit Slow Cooker Queen\nThis **slow cooker chicken fajitas** recipe only has 5 ingredients: chicken, onions, bell peppers, diced tomatoes, and fajita seasoning. Quick and tasty, you can serve this healthy (low-carb, paleo, Whole30) fajita dish with your favorite accompaniments. Instructions to make this simple fajita recipe in the Instant Pot are also included. \n\n![side view shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-2.jpg)\n\nIngredients For Chicken Fajitas (ONLY 5)\n----------------------------------------\n\nThere are only 5 ingredients in the easy fajita recipe! \n\n1.  **Chicken:** Boneless, skinless breasts (or thighs).\n2.  **Fajita Seasoning:** My homemade fajita blend is included in the recipe box. If you have your own, feel free to use it. \n3.  **Bell Peppers:** 3 large bell peppers. I used green, red, and orange so it would be colorful. 3 bell peppers of the same color works just fine. \n4.  **Onions:** 1 large onion or 2 small onions. Don’t slice them too thin. \n5.  **Tomatoes:** 14.5-ounce can of diced tomatoes or your favorite salsa\n\n![collage of the chicken fajita ingredients](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-6.jpg)\n\nHow To Make Chicken Fajitas In The Crock-Pot\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMaking chicken fajitas is very easy, especially when you use your slow cooker (Crock-Pot) or pressure cooker (Instant Pot). \n\n[**Slow Cooker**](https://amzn.to/2OuNJ7r)\n\n1.  Season the chicken with salt & pepper. Add the chicken & all the other ingredients to the slow cooker. Stir to mix well.\n2.  Cook HIGH 2-3 hours or LOW 4-6.\n\n**[Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2OriB8u)** \n\n1.  Turn the Instant Pot to sauté. Once hot, add the oil, onion, and bell pepper and cook 3-5 minutes until soft.\n2.  Season the chicken with salt & pepper. Add the seasoned chicken, diced tomatoes, and all the other  seasonings to the pot. Stir to mix well. Close lid and seal valve. Set **high pressure** and cook **8 minutes**. When cooking time is complete, quick release pressure.\n\n![](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-10.jpg)\n\nbefore (slow cooker)\n\nChicken Breasts or Chicken Thighs?\n----------------------------------\n\nNormally my go-to cut of chicken when I use my slow cooker is chicken thighs. I used chicken breasts here. I prefer to use breasts in particular with fajitas. You can also make these with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. If you do, add an additional 30 minutes to an hour of cook time for the slow cooker and 1 minutes for the pressure cooker. You need to do this because dark meat takes longer to cook than white meat. Since this recipe uses chicken breasts, it’s not a recipe that can sit on the WARM setting. This will overcook the chicken and dry out the meat. When the food is done cooking, turn off the appliance. \n\n![](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-3.jpg)\n\nafter (slow cooker)\n\nHomemade Fajita Seasoning\n-------------------------\n\nIn the recipe box you will find my go-to homemade fajita seasoning. If you use it (which I hop you do) then technically this is recipe is more than 5 ingredients.  Hopefully you already have these spices in your pantry already. My fajita spice blend makes about 1/3 cup of seasonings. Personally, I make a big batch and keep it in my pantry.\n\n![overhead shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-4.jpg)\n\nHow To Serve The Fajitas\n------------------------\n\nTraditionally fajitas are served in corn or flour tortillas. I believe you should serve these fajitas according to your dietary restrictions. My go-to is lettuce wraps. Other suggestions are tortillas or over rice (regular, brown, or riced cauliflower). You can also use this as filling for burritos or even enchiladas. Popular garnishes for fajitas include cheese, guacamole, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, etc. \n\n![side view shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-7.jpg)\n\nFAQs & Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Store leftover fajitas in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. \n*   I used a [6-quart slow cooker](https://amzn.to/2O382Kj) or [Instant Pot.](https://amzn.to/2OzHIH6)\n\n**Mexican Inspired Recipes**\n----------------------------\n\n*   [**Steak Fajitas**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-steak-fajitas/)\n*   [**Salsa Verde Chicken**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken/)\n*   **[Cilantro-Lime Beef](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-carne-asada/)** \n*   **[Enchilada Tri-Tip](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-mexican-tri-tip-paleo-whole30/)**\n*   [**Salsa Verde Beef**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/video-slow-cooker-instant-pot-salsa-verde-beef-low-carb-paleo-whole30/)\n\n[Print](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/video-slow-cooker-instant-pot-chicken-fajitas-low-carb-paleo-whole30/print/11014/)\n\n![overhead shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-8.jpg)\n\n*   2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips\n*   3 large bell peppers, sliced\n*   1 large onion or 2 small onions, sliced\n*   15 ounces diced tomatoes or salsa\n*   1/3 cup fajita seasonings (see below for homemade blend)\n*   Salt & pepper to season the chicken\n*   3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth (for Instant Pot only)\n\n**Homemade Fajita Seasoning**\n\n*   2 tablespoons chili powder\n*   1 tablespoon cumin\n*   1 1/2 teaspoons salt (or more)\n*   1 1/2 teaspoon oregano\n*   1 teaspoon paprika\n*   1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   1 teaspoon onion powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n[**Slow Cooker**](https://amzn.to/2OuNJ7r)\n\n1.

This recipe makes at least 6 servings (depending on how hungry you are) and will probably give you lunch and dinner for another day or two!\n\n![Bowl filled with chicken, corn, black beans, shredded cheese, avocados, cilantro and la wedge of lime](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-1.jpg)\n\nAnd yes, it tastes as dreamy as it looks….\n\nCooking chicken in slow cooker or crockpot\n------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, let’s talk about how to make the chicken. Think of this as a slow cooker (or some call it crockpot) chicken recipe inspired by yummy Mexican flavors, so you will find all the good stuff such as jalapeños, cumin, chili powder, and cilantro involved.\n\nThe best part is, with a crockpot and all the delicious spices/sauces we are adding, making the chicken flavorful, tender and delicious requires almost zero efforts.\n\nWell, maybe a little effort. 😉 As little as combining all the ingredients into the slow cooker.\n\nThese ingredients are:\n\n*   chicken – I used chicken breast, but chicken thighs work as well\n*   chicken broth\n*   salsa (I like to use chunky salsa, but pick your favorite!)\n*   smoked paprika\n*   cumin\n*   chili powder\n*   BRIANNAS Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nJust dump it all in the slow cooker, cover, and let it do its thing for 4 hours on high.\n\nI do want to pause and take a moment to reflect on how much I’m loving BRIANNAS salad dressings. I recently discovered that they are not just amazing salad dressings, they actually have multiple super powers.\n\n![Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing in the background](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-5.jpg)\n\nSuper power #1: makes salads taste amazing. But we know that already.\n\nSuper power #2: it’s an INCREDIBLE marinade. And works like magic in the crockpot!\n\nThat is right. Made out of quality ingredients, they make amazing marinades for your favorite protein. Like mind-blowing, over-the-fence, cannot-get-enough kind of incredible.\n\nHere’s the best part: you can search for BRIANNAS dressings near you [HERE](https://www.briannas.com/where-to-buy/) and join in the fun!\n\nThis Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing has yummy flavors of jalapeño, cilantro and lime in it, and it takes the flavors of our slow cooker chicken to the next level. In addition (because why stop there?), it also gives the sauce a slightly thicker, creamier texture.\n\nTranslation: I love this dressing; I love this Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl. Lots of love going around.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooked on high for 4 hours, shred it. You will find that the chicken will easily fall apart.\n\n![Shredding chicken in a crockpot using a pair of tongs](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-7.jpg)\n\nShredded Chicken in the crockpot\n\nNext, let the shredded chicken sit for about 10 minutes so it soaks in the yummy juices. Yum yum yum.\n\n**All the ways to serve Chicken Burrito Bowl!**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSomething else I love – the versatility of Chicken Burrito Bowl.\n\nServe the chicken with some (or all) of these yummy ingredients. Mix and match to your heart’s content. Make the Chicken Burrito Bowl of your dream.\n\nBest of all, these ingredients take little to no time to prepare:\n\n*   Rice – white or brown rice, or grab a box of Spanish rice or Mexican rice!\n*   Beans\n*   Corn\n*   Avocado\n*   Cheese\n*   Tortilla Chips\n*   Tomatoes\n*   Pico de Gallo\n*   My [Quick 15 Minutes Queso](https://www.joyousapron.com/easy-15-minute-queso-cheese-dip/)\n*   My [Homemade Guacamole](https://www.joyousapron.com/homemade-chunky-guacamole/)\n*   Jalapeños, if you like it spicy!\n\nSqueeze some lime juice onto the bowl, drizzle it with more BRIANNAS’ Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nDIG IN and enjoy that lovely Chicken Burrito Bowl that you just tailor made for yourself!\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing on the side](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-3.jpg)\n\nFlavorful, so much texture, pretty healthy, and so much going on in a simple bowl. I adore this delicious Chicken Burrito Bowl made in the slow cooker, and I have a suspicion that you would too!\n\nTips and Tricks\n---------------\n\nHere are some additional tips and tricks when making Chicken Burrito Bowl using the crockpot:\n\n*   When shredding the chicken, use a pair of tongs and fork to shred it. It should come apart really easily!\n*   Taste the chicken after you shred it, and if needed add salt to open up the flavors. I did not add salt, but whether salt is needed will depend on the chicken broth and/or salsa used.\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-4.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can you freeze Slow Cooker Chicken?**\n\nAbsolutely! Store in an airtight container in either the refrigerator or freezer. If you are storing it in the refrigerator, consume within 5 days. They store really well and make great leftovers and meal prep! Store ingredients separately and tailor make your Chicken Burrito Bowl when ready to eat!\n\n**How do I make the chicken in the Instant pot?**\n\nPressure cook on high for 15 minutes in the Instant Pot.\n\n**How do I make this low carb?**\n\nUse cauliflower rice instead of white or brown rice.\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS RECIPE?

    "markdown": "# Slow Cooker Meatballs in Tomato Sauce | Living Lou\n_These slow cooker meatballs are a traditional, Italian style meatballs made with ground beef and pork, Parmesan cheese, herbs and spices. They are slow simmered in tomato sauce, to tender perfection in the crock pot and are perfect served over spaghetti. This post was originally published in 2014._\n\n[![Beef meatballs in slow cooker with tomato sauce and basil.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker.jpg)](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker/)\n\n[](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker/)[Jump to Recipe](#recipe)\n\n6 hours 25 minutes\n\nI’ve been a big fan of the slow cooker for _years._ And then the pressure cooker came around and I feel like people kind of forgot about the beauty of the slow cooker. The hands-off nature of it. My favourite that I’ve had for eight years is this [6-quart slow cooker from KitchenAid](https://amzn.to/39yPLv7). \n\nThis meatball recipe is as easy as any meatball recipe out there. The first step is to mix the ingredients for the tomato sauce in the slow cooker, and then you mix and shape the meatballs. And everything cooks in the slow cooker at the same time. \n\nYes, you read that right. All you need to do is turn your slow cooker on. \n\n[![Closeup of slow cooker meatballs on a spoon with basil sprinkled on top.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/slow-cooker-giant-meatballs.jpg)](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/slow-cooker-giant-meatballs/)\n\n### Do I need to brown the meatballs before putting them in the slow cooker? \n\nWith this recipe, there is no need to brown the meatballs. They hold their shape and cook perfectly and end up tender and juicy in the slow cooker. You could also try using this method with my [turkey and spinach meatballs](https://www.livinglou.com/turkey-and-spinach-meatballs/).\n\nThe meatballs are gently simmered in the crockpot and the tomato sauce becomes luscious and rich. I like to use mixture of lean ground beef and pork for these so that the sauce doesn’t become greasy. \n\n[![Italian beef meatballs in the slow cooker with tomato sauce.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/slow-cooker-meatballs.jpg)](https://www.livinglou.com/slow-cooker-monster-meatballs-tomato-sauce/slow-cooker-meatballs/)\n\nThe secret to these meatballs comes from dried fennel. I find it gives them a hint of fennel without being overpowering. Think of the meatballs you’d have at your favourite Italian restaurant. \n\nThe other secret to a rich, slow cooker tomato sauce comes from using an entire can of tomato paste. This adds a depth of flavour to the tomato sauce that you’d find in a slow simmered tomato sauce. \n\n![Beef meatballs in slow cooker with tomato sauce and basil.](https://www.livinglou.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/meatballs-in-the-slow-cooker-190x190.jpg)\n\n#### For Tomato Sauce\n\n*   1 28oz can whole tomatoes, broken up with a spoon\n*   1 5.5 oz can tomato paste\n*   1 onion, chopped\n*   1 carrot, chopped\n*   4 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 teaspoon sugar\n*   ½ teaspoon salt\n*   ¼ teaspoon chili flakes\n*   10 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced, for garnish\n\n#### For Meatballs\n\n*   1 lb lean ground beef\n*   1 lb lean ground pork\n*   2 eggs\n*   ¾ cup bread crumbs\n*   ⅓ cup milk\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   ¼ cup minced parsley\n*   ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese\n*   ½ teaspoon fennel, crushed\n*   ½ teaspoon salt\n*   ¼ teaspoon pepper\n\n*   In the slow cooker, combine whole tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, carrot, garlic, salt and hot pepper flakes.\n    \n*   In a large bowl, mix beef, pork, eggs, bread crumbs, milk, garlic, parsley, Parmesan cheese, fennel seeds, salt and pepper until combined.\n    \n*   Shape in 12 large meatballs and arrange meatballs on top of tomato sauce in the slow cooker.\n    \n*   Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours, until carrots are tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into several meatballs reads 160F.

    "markdown": "# Slow Cooker Italian Beef Ragu - Vikalinka\n_**This rustic Italian Beef Ragu requires minimum skill or effort as it is made easily in a slow cooker. The rich and chunky ragu is packed with vibrant flavour and is so satisfying to eat. Use it with pasta or in lasagna and freeze the rest!**_\n\nNot planning to use a slow cooker? Check out my [Tuscan Ragu](https://vikalinka.com/tuscan-ragu/)!\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a piece of chunky bread and a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-3-Edit.jpg)\n\nI am going to admit openly that I am not a big fan of crock pots. Mine doesn’t get used very often, mostly because I enjoy the cooking process and am too much of a control freak to let the slow cooker take over.\n\nI also find meals cooked in a crock pot taste too similar to each other. They taste like stew. I like stew but not every day of the week.\n\nI am however, a HUGE fan of tender, melt-in-your-mouth, big and bold flavour meat. And if a slow cooker has to take the centre stage for this to happen, so be it. I suppose I can share the limelight…for one day.\n\n![Bowl of pasta in beef ragu](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-23-Edit.jpg)\n\nHave you ever had a really tasty and satisfying Italian beef ragu at your favourite Italian restaurant? I am talking about rich and satisfying meat based tomato sauce that’s been cooked for hours allowing for deep flavours to build and blend into a beautiful medley.\n\nI really love rustic dishes that look scruffy and taste earthy. While this may not exactly be food art it is a beautiful sight nonetheless. And I can’t even begin to describe how tender and flavourful this ragu is!\n\nTruth is, not all incredible food needs to be high cuisine. Sometimes all we need is kick-ass flavour to turn dinner into something special.\n\nAnd this ragu has heaps of flavour, with savoury beef, sweet and acidic tomatoes and rich red wine. Truly this is the king of pasta sauces!\n\n![close up of beef ragu in a pot](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MG_1602-3-682x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat is Italian Beef Ragu?\n--------------------------\n\nJust imagine a 4 pound hunk of beef smothered in plum Italian tomatoes, fresh rosemary and thyme. Then it is sprinkled with salt and pepper and minced garlic and drowned in half a bottle of Chianti. It is then left simmering slowly for 12…that’s right, 12 hours over low heat.\n\nHow can it not taste divine?\n\nItalian Beef Ragu and Bolognese sauces are twins but not exactly the same. There are differences but they are so subtle that many Italians use the words interchangeably.\n\nThe main characteristic of the beef ragu is it’s heavily meat-based sauce. If you see more meat than tomato, you’ve got yourself a proper Italian beef ragu.\n\nThe bold taste of this sauce will leave you gobsmacked. I mean in a complete disbelief that you barely lifted a finger for this awesomeness to come out of your kitchen. Crock pot, you win.\n\nBeef ragu pasta\n---------------\n\nYou are probably wondering how to eat this delicious sauce. Well, seeing that it’s Italian I served it with pappardelle pasta and and generous grating of parmesan cheese.\n\nActually you can serve this beef ragu with any pasta of your choice.  Just bear in mind that it’s a robust sauce, so your pasta should match it.\n\nNo delicate capellini or even spaghetti will do quite as well.  It will, however, taste great with rigatoni, penne or any other sturdy pasta.\n\n![Top down of a bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-25-Edit-2.jpg)\n\nRecipe tips and notes\n---------------------\n\n*   Because of the slow cooking process and the number of other flavours added to the beef, there isn’t a lot of benefit in buying an expensive cut of meat. This is a good recipe to save money on a cheap cut of meat, which will become tender and flavourful as it cooks.\n*   The red wine is an amazing source of flavour for a ragu and I always keep a bottle on hand to use in recipes like this. If you don’t want to cook with wine, it can be replaced with beef stock.\n*   Barley is optional, but is a great way to thicken the ragu while adding nutrition. Barley doesn’t add a lot of flavour beyond a subtle nuttiness, but makes the ragu creamier by releasing starch during the cooking process.\n*   A hearty pasta sauce needs a hearty pasta, so choose a thick pasta like pappardelle, fettuccine or tagliatelle.\n\nServing suggestions\n-------------------\n\nServing this ragu with pasta may be the most obvious way to go, but it also could be the best. The rich sauce and chunks of beef coat pasta beautifully, especially when using a thick and hearty pasta like pappardelle or tagliatelle.\n\nIt’s a rich pasta sauce, so is at its best when paired with something lighter that can cut through the beef. My go-to is a [caprese salad](https://vikalinka.com/tomato-salad-basil-mozzarella-caprese/) with sweet tomatoes and fresh basil, but a simple green salad will also do nicely. I also love adding [garlic bread](https://vikalinka.com/air-fryer-garlic-bread/) to soak up any remaining sauce.\n\nAlthough this delicious beef ragu is Italian by origin don’t let it stop you from serving it with anything you can think of. At the end of our dinner tonight, we all agreed this meat would taste absolutely amazing in a burrito, served on top of rice or even with some potatoes.\n\nStorage and leftovers\n---------------------\n\nThis Italian beef ragu incredibly versatile and because you cook a whole roast you are bound to have lots of leftovers.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to use leftover ragu other than serving it with pasta. I’ve actually used it in two different recipes: [Rustic Three Cheese Lasagna](https://vikalinka.com/2014/05/12/rustic-three-cheese-lasagna/) and [Italian Beef and Roasted Red Pepper Quesadillas](https://vikalinka.com/2014/03/19/italian-beef-and-roasted-red-pepper-quesadillas-with-tomato-and-basil-salsa/).\n\nThis ragu freezes absolutely beautifully!  And let me tell you, you will be so pleased to find a container of this goodness on a night when you can’t possibly face spending a long time in the kitchen!\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Beef Ragu with a piece of chunky bread and a fork](https://vikalinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beef-ragu-3-Edit-320x320.jpg)\n\nCrock Pot Rustic Italian Beef Ragu\n----------------------------------\n\nRich Italian beef ragu slowly simmered in your slow cooker for maximum flavour.

The long and slow cooking time makes all the flavors meld well. This is in addition to the rich combination of spices included in the marinade, make this dish irresistible.\n\nMy family and I discovered this dish while visiting India years ago, and we all loved it. Of course, I had to try and make it. And if I do say so myself, the results are even better than the one we tried! The trick to this recipe is the slow cooker. Letting it do all the work for you while you go on your day is awesome, and you get to return to a delicious meal at the end of the day!\n\nI start by marinating my chicken the night before. Just leave it in the fridge to soak up all the flavors. Then, before I leave for the day, I sauté it and put it in the slow cooker with the sauce to cook while I am out. If you need your chicken sooner, you can cook it on high for three to four hours. However, for the best flavor and most tender chicken, I recommend cooking on low for six to seven hours.\n\nWhy you will love this recipe\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **It is so easy:** Marinate the chicken the night before. Then sauté the chicken and toss it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients before enjoying your day. Then, you can come back to a delicious but easy meal.\n*   **Authentic flavor:** If your goal is to serve an authentic Indian meal, this one you should definitely try.\n*   **Leftovers taste incredible:** Some recipes taste better the next day. This crockpot butter chicken is one of them. Save some for lunch or dinner tomorrow.\n*   **Make it your way:** Although I prefer this dish just the way it is, sometimes I like to mix it up by adding or removing some of the ingredients. For example, when I have people sensitive to spicy foods, I leave out chili powder and garam masala.\n\n![a wooden spoon with creamy Indian butter chicken](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals3-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nWhat you’ll need to make slow cooker butter chicken\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Special items:\n\n*   **Slow cooker** – Whether you have a slow cooker or crockpot, the directions are the same.\n*   **Large skillet** – For sautéing the chicken. \n*   **Wooden spoon –** I prefer wooden utensils because they do not scratch the ceramic in my slow cooker.\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n*   **Chicken –** I use skinless boneless chicken thighs because they are easy to prepare, and my family prefers white meat. Whatever meat you use, just cut it into two-inch cubes.\n*   **Yogurt**—Plain Greek yogurt is my preference for this marinade. It adds a nice, mellow acid with a mild, creamy flavor.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Garlic powder**—I put garlic powder in just about everything, and it is perfect for marinating chicken because it is concentrated and will add more garlic taste.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Turmeric –** A popular curry spice, turmeric adds an earthy background with hints of pepper, ginger, and sweetness. Some say it tastes similar to mustard. It can also be somewhat bitter if you use too much.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red chili powder and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your marinade a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer to use sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n\n### For the sauce:\n\n*   **Olive oil –** I always use extra virgin olive oil because it is light and has a mild flavor**.** In this recipe, it is used to sauté the chicken.\n*   **Butter**—Because butter is the star of this dish, I only use the highest-quality butter without salt. If your butter has salt, remove it from the sauce ingredients.\n*   **Onion –** Minced and sauteed to add a fresh onion flavor without any bitterness that the powder has.\n*   **Garlic –** Also minced and sauteed, fresh garlic gives your sauce a deep, rich garlic taste.\n*   **Tomato sauce**—Another important ingredient. I prefer to use organic tomatoes to make my own, but you can use your favorite brand.\n*   **Evaporated milk –** Any kind of evaporated milk will do, but the better the quality, the better the flavor.\n*   **Heavy cream**—Do not substitute this ingredient unless you really have to because it gives your sauce the creaminess it needs to taste authentic.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your sauce a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n*   **Black pepper –** Grind your own from fresh peppercorns for the best taste.\n*   **Sugar –** I use granulated white sugar for sweetness, but you could use honey or maple syrup.\n\nHow to make slow cooker butter chicken?\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** The night before (or at least 30 minutes before), mix all of the marinade ingredients in a heavy-duty zipper baggie and add chicken. Put it in the fridge to marinate.\n2.  **Sauté the chicken:** When ready to begin, heat a large skillet with oil over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add chicken in batches so you don’t crowd the pan. Cook for about three to five minutes, or until it is brown on each side. Set it aside on a plate and cover with foil.\n3.  **Make the sauce:** Now, add the butter to the pan and let it melt before adding the garlic, onion, and ginger. Continue to stir and cook for two minutes. Add the paprika, sugar, red chili powder, garam masala, and cumin, and cook for another minute.\n4.  **Transfer to the pot:** Next, pour the sauce into your slow cooker and stir in the chicken. Add the evaporated milk and tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste.\n5.  **Cook the chicken:** Turn your pot to low and cook for six to seven hours or on high for three to four hours. About 30 minutes before the cooking time is up, stir in the heavy cream.\n6.  **Serve:** Finally, serve your butter chicken with whatever side dishes you like.\n\nExpert tip\n----------\n\n### Finding your own garam masala\n\nBecause there are many different garam masala blends, it is good to find your favorite before you cook with it. The most common variety is made with black peppercorns, green and black cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and mace. Some other types have fennel seeds, bay leaves, coriander, and chili powder. Others have only pepper, cloves, cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom.\n\nAll varieties and blends of garam masala are considered authentic Indian spices, so it is up to you to decide which mixture you prefer. Kosher garam masala has organic pepper, coriander, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom. Each spice, such as cardamom and fennel, can be ground into a powder or left as whole seeds or pods.\n\nBiryani masala is another variety of spices made with caraway seeds and anise. Another kind you may see on the market is chaat masala, which has dried mango powder added for a bit of sweet tanginess. You can also make your own, so you only get the spices you like and the right amounts.\n\n![slow cooker butter chicken served with rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals5-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nRecipe variations and add-ins:\n------------------------------\n\n*   **Different cuts:** Instead of skinless boneless chicken breast, you could also use thighs. Dark meat has a more robust flavor and is always juicy.\n*   **Different meat:** If your butcher does not have fresh organic chicken, you could use a different meat. I have tried pork, turkey. They are all truly delicious in their way.\n*   **Cheesy butter chicken:** Another way to change this recipe is to add some shredded cheese. I have tried cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.\n*   **Make it spicy:** Even with the garam masala and chili powder, this dish is not that spicy. If you want to add some heat, add red pepper flakes to the marinade and toss chopped jalapenos into the sauce.\n\nServing suggestions:\n--------------------\n\nSlow-cooker butter chicken goes great with all sorts of side dishes. Here are some ideas my family loves:\n\n*   To make this a whole meal in one pot, add some baby red potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.\n*   I like to serve my saucy butter chicken on top of some [perfect fluffy rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/how-to-cook-perfect-rice-in-the-instant-pot/) and garlic naan on the side.\n*   Any kind of side dish would pair nicely with this dish, but for an Indian theme, try it with chutney, chana masala, naan, or [grilled eggplant](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-eggplant-recipe/).\n*   Add a light salad on the side, like this [strawberry broccoli salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/strawberry-broccoli-salad-recipe/) or [grilled zucchini salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-zucchini-salad-recipe/).\n*   To help soak that delicious sauce, serve with some crusty French bread or rolls like my [Amish potato dinner rolls](https://urls.grow.me/https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/amish-potato-dinner-rolls-recipe/%23growSource=search&growReferrer=true).\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Why is my slow cooker butter chicken watery?\n\nFirst, the most common reason for watery butter chicken is too much liquid. That may be the obvious thing, but many people overlook it. Keep an eye on your measuring to make sure the amounts are all correct. Another problem could be that you added the cream and butter too soon. Try waiting for the sauce to cool before adding them. Thicken up your sauce with a bit of cornstarch slurry.\n\n### How long do I cook chicken in a slow cooker?\n\nThe time to cook chicken in a slow cooker depends on the cut of meat and how large it is. If you are cooking a whole chicken, you may have to let it cook for six hours on low or up to nine hours on high. Chicken breasts can be finished in six or seven hours on low or three to four on high. Chopped chicken, like in this dish, can cook even faster, so make sure you check the internal temp early. Once it reaches 160 degrees F, you can shut off the crockpot, which will continue to cook, reaching 165 degrees F quickly.\n\n### How do I make my butter chicken tender?\n\nNo chicken should be chewy or rubbery, but it happens sometimes. It can happen if your chicken was not cooked long enough or when it is cooked too long. You have to get it to the correct temperature for eating, which is 165 degrees F, without going over that number. Using the marinade in this recipe should keep your chicken from drying out, especially since you are cooking it low and slow in a creamy sauce.\n\n### Why did my butter chicken sauce crack?\n\nGetting the sauce perfect can be difficult if you do not follow the directions carefully. If you overcook it after adding the butter, it will separate. If it simmers too long, the water can evaporate, and the sauce will dry and crack. Another thing to be careful of is to add the yogurt while it is not too hot, or it will curdle. The same goes for the cream. Do not mix the cream in until the last step so it will blend seamlessly. \n\n![crockpot butter chicken with a wooden spoon into the mixture](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals2-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nHow to store:\n-------------\n\n*   **Refrigerate:** After cooled to room temperature, put your crockpot butter chicken in a sealed container. It will stay fresh for up to 10 days. \n*   **Freezing:** If you want to keep it longer, you must freeze it. Once it has cooled, pour it into a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, and it can stay frozen for four to six months. \n*   **Defrost:** Remove your frozen leftovers from the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you plan to serve them.\n*   **Reheating:** Heat in a saucepan on the stove for 10 minutes or in the microwave for one or two minutes. \n\nRecipe tips:\n------------\n\n*   To easily remove cardamom pods after cooking, use a needle and thread to tie them together. Then, before serving, lift the thread out to remove all the pods at once.\n*   If your chicken is too thin, add some cornstarch slurry and heat it a little longer. You can make a slurry by mixing one tablespoon of cornstarch with one cup of warm water.\n*   If it has an acid taste, add another tablespoon of sugar or honey.\n*   I usually double the sauce recipe because I like to use it when reheating. It also tastes great on tacos, pasta, and bread.\n*   When freezing, put your leftovers in small freezer-safe containers to take out just what you need when you need it.\n\nSlow Cooker Butter Chicken is made with tender, perfectly seasoned chicken and a rich curry sauce made with tomato and cream. This combination is nothing short of mouthwateringly delicious and so easy to make—the slow cooker does all the work. \n\n![image of slow cooker butter chicken](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals1-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\n### Chicken Marinade:\n\n*   ▢ 2 lbs chicken breasts or thighs cut into 2-inch cubes\n*   ▢ 1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon fresh minced ginger\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon garam masala\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon turmeric\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon of salt\n\n### Sauce:\n\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons butter\n*   ▢ 1 large onion diced\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic minced\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon ginger minced\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garam masala\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon sugar\n*   ▢ 14 oz tomato sauce\n*   ▢ 1 1/4 teaspoons salt or to taste\n*   ▢ 1 cup evaporated milk\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup heavy cream\n\n### Chicken Marinade:\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    In a bowl or large ziplock bag, combine chicken pieces with all of the MARINADE ingredients, cover with plastic wrap, and let marinate for 30 minutes or overnight in the fridge.\n    \n\n### Saute the Chicken:\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    Place a large skillet over medium-high heat.

All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\n\n![Post Image](https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,g_center,w_730,h_913/k%2Farchive%2Ff33558b0c4da039b6315aa4ada2aa09939f2cad7)\n\nThis is my absolute favorite kind of [slow cooker recipe](https://www.thekitchn.com/slow-cooker-recipes-23076631) — one that takes less than five minutes to pull together and then rewards you with a delicious, healthy dinner at the end of the day. These burrito bowls are **full of chili-spiced [brown rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice-113856), [black beans,](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-black-bean-recipes-227509) [corn](https://www.thekitchn.com/corn-recipes-259912), and yes, tender bites of [shredded chicken](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-shredded-chicken-in-the-slow-cooker-231481)**. Everything gets cooked right in the pot, so all you need to do is dish yourself a bowl and sprinkle with cheese.\n\nTwo Stages of the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nI usually do this recipe in two stages. First, I get the [chicken](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-chicken-recipes-261543) going with some [broth](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-stock-and-broth-word-of-mouth-71199) and diced tomatoes, and then I add the [rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-rice-on-the-stove-44333), [beans](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-beans-on-the-stove-182717), and corn midway through cooking. This ensures that everything finishes cooking at the same time and the beans don’t get too mushy.\n\nIf I’m going to be gone for a while and won’t be home to add the rice, I just leave it out of the slow cooker and cook it separately on the stovetop just before serving. It dirties one more pot, but it gives me some flexibility with my schedule.\n\nKeep an Eye on the Rice\n-----------------------\n\nThe first few times you make this, pay special attention to the rice. I like using [brown rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/slow-cooker-brown-rice-259084) here because it holds its shape better over longer cooking, but it can be a bit hard to judge exactly when it will be done.\n\nI use a basic grocery-store brand of rice and it typically finishes cooking in 3 1/2 hours on low in this recipe; whichever brand or variety you use, I suggest checking it after about 2 1/2 hours to see how quickly it’s cooking and if it needs more liquid. (Speaking of liquid, you’ll get some from the [canned tomatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/25-ways-to-use-canned-tomatoes-261469), so you won’t need to add as much broth as you normally would if you were cooking the rice by itself. Even so, use your best judgement if you think more or less liquid is needed.)\n\nI use my small three-quart slow cooker for this recipe. It’s just big enough to fit everything at once and give the rice plenty of room to expand as it cooks. If you have a larger slow cooker, I’d suggest doubling the recipe and freezing half for other meals.\n\nWays To Enjoy the Chicken Burrito Bowl\n--------------------------------------\n\nOne of the best things about this recipe, aside from how easy it is to make, is the way all the flavors and ingredients mingle during cooking. The chicken cooks in a tomato-rich, cumin-spiked broth, which then gets absorbed by the rice later on. Every bite ends up deeply seasoned and fragrant with spices.\n\nEat it in a bowl with slices of [avocado](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-slice-an-avocado-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-200500) and a dollop of [sour cream](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-sour-cream-23386619), or roll it up in a [burrito](https://www.thekitchn.com/easy-bean-rice-burrito-recipe-23024697) for lunch. Either way, it’s a win. This simple slow-cooker meal has more than earned its spot in my regular lineup.\n\n[Comments](#comments-207333)\n\nThese chicken burrito bowls only require five minutes of hands-on prep time — the rest of the work is done by your slow cooker.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 to 1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken thighs, or a mix\n    \n*   1 (14.5-ounce) can\n    \n    diced tomatoes\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed\n    \n*   2 teaspoons\n    \n    chili powder\n    \n*   2 teaspoons\n    \n    salt\n    \n*   1 teaspoon\n    \n    ground cumin\n    \n*   1 (15-ounce) can\n    \n    black beans, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    uncooked brown rice\n    \n*   1 cup\n    \n    frozen corn kernels\n    \n*   _Optional toppings:_ shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, sour cream, diced avocado, salsa, hot sauce, diced green onions, shredded lettuce\n    \n\n1.  Combine the chicken, diced tomatoes and their juices, chicken broth, chili powder, salt, and cumin in a 2 1/2- to 3 1/2-quart slow cooker. Make sure the chicken is covered with liquid, adding additional broth as needed. Cover and cook on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours.\n    \n2.  Uncover and stir in the beans, rice, and corn. Cover and continue cooking on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours more. Check the rice periodically in the last hour of cooking, stirring once or twice to make sure the rice cooks evenly and adding more chicken broth if the mixture seems dry. Cooking is done when the rice is tender — if the rice is done but there is still liquid left in the slow cooker, uncover and cook on the HIGH setting to let the liquid evaporate.\n    \n3.  Use 2 forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. You can do this either in the slow cooker itself and then mix it into the rice, or you can transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board if you prefer to keep it separate. Taste and stir in more salt or other seasonings as needed. Serve burrito bowls with a selection of toppings.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Cooking the rice separately:** If you won't be home to add the rice to the slow cooker, you can skip this step and cook it separately on the stovetop just before serving (use [these directions](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice-113856)). To modify the recipe, combine the chicken, diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of stock, and spices in the slow cooker and cook for 6 to 8 hours on the LOW setting. Add the beans and corn and cook for 30 minutes more, or until warmed through, while you're cooking the rice (omit the remaining chicken broth).\n\n**Vegetarian burrito bowls:** Combine the diced tomatoes, 1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth, spices, rice, black beans, and corn in the slow cooker. Cook on the LOW setting for 3 to 4 hours, until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Stir once or twice toward the end of cooking to make sure the rice is cooking evenly.\n\n**Beyond burrito bowls**: Besides burrito bowls, you can use this filling to make regular tortilla-wrapped burritos or [freezer burritos](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-i-make-burritos-to-freeze-freezer-friendly-from-jessica-fisher-198682).\n\n**Storage:** The burrito mixture will keep for 1 week refrigerated or for 3 months in the freezer."

Just like my awesome [15-Minute Queso (Cheese Dip)](https://www.joyousapron.com/easy-15-minute-queso-cheese-dip/) recipe, which seem like a complete different food item, but in many ways it is not, chicken broth brings another dimension of flavor to the creamy sauce and elevates it.\n*   Creamy but not crazy heavy – this is a creamy and thick potato dish, but not so much that the cream overpower the potatoes. I like to think that the creaminess and cheese enhances the scalloped potatoes, and not overtake it completely.\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nHere is the full ingredient list to make cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n*   potatoes – My favorite potatoes to use for cheesy scalloped potatoes are Yukon gold potatoes, russets or Idaho. Basically middle to high starch potatoes are perfect for this.\n*   garlic – use fresh garlic because garlic powder is just not as flavorful if you really want the garlic flavors to come through.\n*   cheese – using three cheeses in this cheesy scalloped potatoes: mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan. You can opt for other cheeses as well.\n*   butter\n*   onion – sweet, yellow or white onions\n*   flour – used to thicken the sauce\n*   milk – i typically use 2% milk.\n*   chicken broth – important ingredient for another layer of flavor\n*   thyme – dried or fresh thyme works fine. Fresh will be more flavorful but it’s not necessary\n\n![A casserole of Cheesy Garlic Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-3.jpg)\n\nHow to make Garlic Scalloped Potatoes\n-------------------------------------\n\nNext, I’m going to show you how easy it is to make these cheesy scalloped potatoes!\n\n### Prepare Potatoes\n\nFirst, we are going to prepare the potatoes by slicing them into thin slices. Make sure they are nice and thin (~ 1/8 inch in thickness) so that they cook easily and soften quickly.\n\nHere are two reasons why it’s so easy to make garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n*   no boiling potatoes beforehand\n*   no peeling potatoes\n\nJust make sure you slice those potatoes super thinly and that’s all there is to it when it comes to preparing your potatoes.\n\n![Potatoes sliced thinly](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cheesy-scalloped-potatoes-683x1024.jpg)\n\n_Thinly sliced potatoes_\n\n### Prepare Cheese Sauce\n\nNext we make that delicious garlic cheese sauce, another essential part of our cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes. Gosh I love it so much.\n\nHeat a medium pot to medium heat and add butter.\n\nOnce butter is melted, add diced onions and minced garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until they are soft and fragrant.\n\nAdd flour and stir to combine. Once combined, add milk, chicken broth, thyme and salt. Whisk mixture continuously as it comes to a boil. It’s important to whisk it so that the flour clumps will dissolve.\n\nContinue stirring and cook for a few minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly.\n\nTurn off heat and add shredded cheddar, shredded mozzarella and parmesan. Stir to combine. \n\n![Making cheese sauce in a pot on stove](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cheesy-Scalloped-Potatoes-Process-Shots-1024x439.jpg)\n\nRemove from heat promptly and set aside.\n\nNext we will be layering the potatoes and cheese sauce to form a casserole dish full of cheesy scalloped potatoes.\n\n### Layer Casserole\n\nHere’s how we layer the cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n1.  place 1/3 of the potatoes in [a 9″ x 13″ casserole dish](https://www.joyousapron.com/recommends/baking-dish-rectangular/ \"Baking Dish Rectangular\")\n2.  add 1/3 of the cheese sauce\n3.  repeat 1) and 2) until everything is gone.\n\n![Adding cheese sauce to potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-1.jpg)\n\nTip: As you layer the potatoes, make sure to spread them out and cover each of them well with sauce to ensure all your cheesy scalloped potatoes are fully cooked. Potatoes not covered with sauce are more difficult to cook through and will not be as soft.\n\n### Bake casserole\n\nOnce you have three layers of potatoes and cheese sauce, send your cheesy scalloped potatoes to the oven to bake!\n\nWhen cheesy scalloped potatoes are done, they should be bubbly with a slightly golden brown top. Potatoes should be soft and coated in that rich and creamy cheese sauce.\n\n![A rectangular casserole of Cheesy Garlic Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-2.jpg)\n\nCheese. Potatoes. Cheese. Potatoes.\n\nWith garlic flavored goodness all around it.\n\nMy heart is full. My stomach is full.\n\nThe cheese on the top will be slightly brown and crusty. Dig a spoon into it, and the creamy, velvety cheese will ooze out, along with the now tender and soft slices of potatoes.\n\nOkay YUUUUMMMM.\n\nThis lovely cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes makes the best side to any main dishes. If you truly must, it can also be consumed by itself.\n\nStorage and Reheat\n------------------\n\nCheesy garlic scalloped potatoes are the perfect dish to make ahead. Storage it covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\nTo reheat, simply cover and bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes at 350℉.\n\n![Scooping out some cheesy potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-5.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can I use other cheeses?**\n\nYes! Colby jack, Monterey jack, or any of your favorite blends work great! Make sure out of the cheeses you use, some of them melts easily (soft cheeses).\n\n**Can I freeze cooked scalloped potatoes?**\n\nYes! When ready to reheat, bring it to the refrigerator the night before so that it defrost completely. Then follow the reheating instructions to reheat.\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS RECIPE?

To make things easy, I plan the same menus and use the same shopping list.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Holland-House-Cooking-Wines-3.jpg)\n\nThe only trick is making sure I am preparing dishes we really, _really_ love because we will be eating them at least twice, more if there are leftovers. Thankfully, Butternut Squash Risotto happens to be one of those dishes that I could eat for every meal and never grow tired of.\n\nRisotto in general is a dish that many associate with class and elegance. The type of dish you might order at a fancy restaurant, but not make at home.

First is the rice, Arborio rice. [Arborio rice](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/ingredient/arborio/) is an Italian short grain rice that is named after the town it hails from, Arborio, in the Po Valley. However, present day, it is grown all over, including in the United States.\n\nThe plump, short body makes it unique in its ability to soak up loads of liquid and release starches that result in the creaminess that so many people associate with risotto.\n\nIn fact, while many risotto recipes do contain cream or cheese, many do not and people are often baffled by the creaminess level.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-7.jpg)\n\nThese unique little pods provide a blank slate for flavor, therefore being mindful of what liquid you add is crucial.\n\nTo give my risotto a rich and robust taste, I use Holland House White Cooking Wine. These little flavor bombs soak it up and hold on, releasing the bold flavor when eaten.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Holland-House-Cooking-Wines-1.jpg)\n\nHolland House Cooking Wines are not only a great addition to risotto, you can also use them in any recipe using liquid or needing a punch of flavor.\n\nTry them in soups and stews, to season roast chicken or beef, for sautéing vegetables, in homemade [salad dressings](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/category/recipes/sauce-recipes/dressings/ \"salad dressings\") or even in chili.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-2-1200x801.jpg)\n\n### Holland House offers five fabulous flavors:\n\n### \n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Holland-House-Cooking-Wines.jpg)\n\n*   [Marsala Cooking Wine](https://bit.ly/2RZFPl6) – well-rounded, sweet-wine flavor with hints of hazelnut.

Simply omit the parmesan cheese and butter and use additional olive oil or a plant-based butter alternative. Some kind of fat is needed to sauté the shallots and garlic before adding the rice.\n\n**What can I substitute for the dry white wine?**\n\nIf you prefer not to cook with wine, substitute with additional vegetable or chicken broth.\n\n**I can’t find fresh sage, now what?**\n\nFresh sage and butternut squash work so well together! Especially when mixed with a little parm. If you can’t find any fresh sage, substitute with 1 tsp dried. A little fresh thyme is also fantastic.\n\n**Will any other types of squash work in place of the butternut squash?**\n\nYes. But not all (like spaghetti squash). My top picks ar [acorn squash](https://theforkedspoon.com/how-to-roast-an-acorn-squash/ \"How to Roast an Acorn Squash\") or pumpkin for results, both in taste and texture, most similar to butternut squash.\n\nYou may also include other veggies like peas, carrots, mushrooms, kale, and onion.\n\nWhat is Arborio Rice?\n---------------------\n\nArborio rice is an Italian short-grain rice that is oval in shape. The grains are approximately a quarter of an inch long and typically pearly white in color. Much starchier than other rice varieties (approximately 50 grams per cup), arborio rice has the ability to absorb more water when compared to other types of rice **without becoming mushy**. This is what makes risotto so creamy and delicious!\n\nAside from risotto, arborio is also used to make [rice pudding](https://theforkedspoon.com/almond-rice-pudding-with-golden-raisins/ \"Rice Pudding with Golden Raisins (Arroz con Leche)\"), [paella](https://theforkedspoon.com/paella-recipe/ \"Paella Recipe – How to Make Spanish Paella\"), and arancini.\n\nClick here to [learn all about arborio rice](https://theforkedspoon.com/what-is-arborio-rice/ \"What is Arborio Rice?\") including its nutrition, uses, where it comes from, and different cooking methods.\n\n![Instant Pot filled with cooked risotto and butternut squash garnished with parmesan cheese and minced sage.](https://theforkedspoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-700x1050.jpg)\n\nHow to make Instant Pot Risotto\n-------------------------------\n\n_Full printable recipe with instructions below._\n\nTo make this creamy butternut squash and parmesan risotto using your Instant Pot, you will need, yes, an [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2JkgfFI) (or electric pressure cooker). You will be using both the saute function and manual (or pressure cook) mode. \n\nThe total cooking time is only 6 minutes, but factor in an additional 8 minutes or so for your pressure cooker to reach full pressure.\n\n1\\. **Set your Instant Pot to sauté mode** (medium heat).\n\n2\\. **Melt the butter and add the olive oil**. Add the shallots and stir to coat in the olive oil and 1-2 tablespoons butter. Cook until soft and translucent (approximately 4-6 minutes), then add the garlic and sage, mixing well. Cook until fragrant, approximately 1 minute.\n\n3\\. **Pour in the white wine** (or chicken broth) and scrape off any brown bits that may have formed on the bottom of the pot. Allow the wine to come to a simmer.\n\n4\\. **Stir in the arborio rice**. Stir continuously until most of the liquid is absorbed.\n\n5\\. **Add the broth and butternut squash**. Mix well to combine and season with approximately 1 teaspoon salt.\n\n6\\. **Turn off** the sautéing function.\n\n7\\. **Switch to manual function HIGH pressure** and set the timer for 6 minutes.

Check out the Recipe Notes, below, for more guidance.\n\n**Step-by-Step Video**\n----------------------\n\n**Roast Veggie Tacos Filling**\n------------------------------\n\nThese tacos are filled with roasted sweet potatoes, cauliflower florets, and black beans. So much flavor and texture with really minimal effort – aside from tossing everything together in a homemade taco spice blend, the oven does all the work! 🙌🏼\n\n1\n\n**Season the cauliflower and sweet potatoes.** Toss the chopped veggies with the spices and some olive oil in a large mixing bowl, then spread them out on a large sheet pan. Don’t cram the veggies in! **Why? ⇢** Giving the veggies room to breathe allows steam to escape as they bake. This helps ensure the cauliflower and sweet potatoes get nice and crispy rather than soggy.\n\n2\n\n**Roast in the oven.** Roast the cauliflower and sweet potatoes for about 25 minutes, or until they’re tender through the center and beginning to get crispy around the edges. **Roasted veggies tip! ⇢** Be sure to shake the pan halfway through to ensure everything gets evenly charred.\n\n3\n\n**Cook the black beans.** Just before the veggies finish roasting, add the drained black beans to the pan and pop it back in the oven. **Why? ⇢** Since canned black beans are already fully cooked, the goal is just to warm them through, which takes a couple minutes, tops.\n\n![A close up shot of seasoned and roasted cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato for roasted veggie tacos are arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet. Drained black beans are added to the sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-7.jpg)\n\n**Smoky Chipotle Cashew Crema**\n-------------------------------\n\nThe best part of this veggie tacos recipe is easily drenching the tacos in smoky chipotle lime crema, which is completely vegan and dairy-free thanks to cashews!\n\nIf you’re new to the world of plant-based cooking, cashews are an awesome solution to creating irresistibly creamy vegan sauces like [cashew crema](https://playswellwithbutter.com/cashew-crema/). Nuts feature tons of healthy fats, which are great for making things creamy. When blended with a liquid like water, the rich fats in cashews transform into a beautifully thick, smooth sauce. As a bonus, cashews also have a pretty neutral taste, making them the perfect vehicle for other flavorful ingredients.\n\n**Smoky Chipotle Cashew Crema. ⇢** Simply combine unsalted cashews, chipotle pepper, garlic, chili powder, smoked paprika, lime juice, and water in a high-speed blender, blending until the mixture is totally smooth and creamy – easy! A few tips…\n\n*   **A high-speed blender** is a must for a super smooth cashew crema. We love the [Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100317571-13767625?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zwilling.com%2Fus%2F53100-900-0.html&cjsku=53100-900), which is the perfect size for whipping up a small-batch sauce! \n*   **Blend the crema longer than you think you need to.** We’re after a totally smooth and creamy sauce, which is achieved after a good 45 seconds – 1 minute of blending. If you notice bits and pieces of cashews in your crema, let the blender go a little longer, until the sauce is totally smooth.\n*   **Adjust to your liking.** The measurements included in this recipe yield my ideal consistency – seriously creamy but easy to drizzle over the roasted vegetable tacos. If you prefer a thicker crema, blend in some extra cashews. Or if you prefer a thinner sauce, add a little more water.\n*   **Allergic to cashews? ⇢** No worries! Feel free to prep your crema using dairy-free yogurt (to keep the tacos vegan) or creamy Greek yogurt. \n\n**_No high-speed blender? No problem!_ ⇢** If you do not have a high-speed blender, soak the cashews in boiling-hot water for 10-15 minutes, which helps them break down much more easily in a less powerful blender.

A spoon has been dipped into the vegan crema and is being pulled out covered in the orange-colored creamy sauce & falling off the spoon back into the mason jar.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-15.jpg)\n\n**How to Char Corn Tortillas**\n------------------------------\n\nOne of our favorite taco night tricks is taking plain ol’ store-bought tortillas to the next level with a light char over the flame of a gas burner. The edges of the tortilla get a little crispy – a fantastic contrasting texture for the tender roasted veggies and creamy cashew crema – and the littlest bit of char creates an extra layer of smoky flavor for these cauliflower and sweet potato tacos.\n\n![Charred corn tortillas are arranged atop a metal baking sheet pan that sits atop a creamy white textured surface.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-1-960x1440.jpg)\n\nPlus, it makes the tortillas pretty picture-perfect, and it couldn’t be easier. Here’s what you’ll do…\n\n1\n\n**Pop a tortilla directly over the open flame of a gas burner.** Once you see a little smoke coming off the edges, carefully rotate it with tongs. While you can toast up flour tortillas using this method, I suggest opting for corn tortillas.\n\n2\n\n**Continue until both sides are evenly charred**, but be careful not to overdo it. Too much cooking will completely dry the tortillas out. All you need is a little color!\n\n3\n\n**Repeat with more tortillas**, until you have enough for your taco feast. To keep your charred tortillas pliable and warm for taco assembly, pop them into a handy [tortilla warmer](https://rstyle.me/+9pxfjAMnR6SNU2RngeQwdw) until you’re ready to serve. If you do not have a tortilla warmer, try wrapping the tortillas with a damp paper towel. When you’re ready for taco assembly, simply pop them in the microwave for 30-40 seconds. The moisture in the paper towel steams the tortillas so they stay nice and pliable.\n\n**_No gas burner? No problem!_ ⇢** Many PWWB readers have replicated this charred effect by toasting their tortillas on a griddle or a hot heavy-bottomed pan, such as a large skillet. Follow the same process laid out above, toasting until your tortillas have as much char as you like – easy!\n\n**Taco Assembly + More Easy Topping Ideas**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the best parts about making tacos is assembling them – it’s when all of the flavorful components come together to create a bit of magic. ✨ Try to assemble only as many tacos you know you’ll eat – leftovers keep very well, but ideally need to be stored separately.\n\n![An overhead shot of sweet potato and cauliflower tacos in charred corn tortillas and drizzled with chipotle cashew crema and garnished with fresh chopped cilantro atop a parchment lined baking sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-7.jpg)\n\n**Assembling the ideal roasted veggie taco. ⇢** Grab a charred corn tortilla (don’t forget to reheat them so the tacos aren’t too dry – see above!), then smear it with mashed avocado (I.e. a little avocado with some lime juice). Next, pile on a big hearty spoonful of smoky black bean and roasted veggie taco filling. All that’s left to do? Finish it off with a generous drizzling of chipotle cashew crema (trust us, you’ll want a big spoonful here!).\n\n#### **More Easy Taco Topping Ideas**\n\nOf course, a few extra toppings never hurt on taco night! 🥰 If you feel like finishing your roasted veggie tacos off with a little something extra, try…\n\n*   **Finely chopped cilantro** for a little extra freshness or an extra squeeze of **lime juice** for a little brightness\n*   [Pickled red onions](https://playswellwithbutter.com/quick-pickled-red-onions/) for bright acidity, plus the most gorgeous bright pink pop of color.\n*   Our favorite simple [Everyday Slaw](https://playswellwithbutter.com/simple-slaw-recipe/) provides tons of texture and flavor from cabbage, peppers, and fresh herbs. Plus, it’s made with minimal mayo (or fabanaise, if made vegan) – easy!\n\n![A side angle shot of roasted veggie tacos drizzled with chipotle cashew crema and fresh chopped cilantro arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-12.jpg)\n\nWe can’t wait for you to try these **Sweet Potato and Cauliflower Tacos**!

Whether you’re a longtime vegan, new to a plant-based lifestyle, or you’re simply a meat eater looking to add a few more veggie-forward recipes into your meal plan, you’re in for such a treat!\n\nWhat makes this recipe so special is how its components come together to create layers of flavor and texture that make for a particularly satisfying meal: spiced roasted veggies, hearty black beans, irresistibly creamy dairy-free crema, and smoky charred tortillas.\n\nA few tips to keep in mind along the way…\n\n*   Roast the veggies on a large sheet pan. Giving the individual pieces a little breathing room allows steam to escape as they cook, resulting in perfectly tender-yet-crisp texture.\n*   For best results, blend the cashew crema in a high-speed blender until it’s totally smooth and creamy, which takes a good 45 seconds – 1 minute. Our preferred blender is linked below.\n*   Don’t skip charring your tortillas! All the how’s and why’s are detailed in the blog post, above, along an alternate method if you don’t have a gas stovetop.\n\nAs one of PWWB’s first ever recipes to “go viral,” this roasted veggie tacos recipe holds an extra special place in my taco-loving heart.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil for easy clean-up as desired. Gather and prep all ingredients according to Ingredients List, above (e.g. break down the cauliflower, dice the sweet potato, measure the spices, etc.).![Cauliflower florets, sweet potato, olive oil, chili powder, ground cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, dried oregano, black beans, roasted unsalted cashews, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, garlic, and lime arranged on a light peach colored surface and a wooden cutting board.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-2-595x397.jpg)\n2.  **Season the cauliflower and sweet potatoes:** Place the cauliflower florets and sweet potato in a large bowl or on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the olive oil over top, then season with the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, dried oregano, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and ground black pepper as desired. Toss to combine well, then arrange in a uniform layer on the baking sheet, giving the individual veggies plenty of breathing room to roast up nicely.![Cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with spices are arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet.

Roast 30 minutes, giving the pan a good shake halfway through to promote even browning, or until the veggies are tender throughout and crispy at the edges. In the last 5 minutes of roasting, place the drained black beans on the sheet pan, allowing them to warm up as the veggies finish cooking. Remove from the oven. Squeeze the lime juice over the surface of the sheet pan and set aside.![Seasoned and roasted cauliflower florets and diced sweet potato are arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet.

Combine all listed ingredients in a high-speed blender. Blend until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender canister as needed. Transfer to a bowl and set aside, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. (At my house, we like to enjoy these tacos with a simple smashed avocado (avocado + lime + salt) and charred tortillas (more notes on this in the Recipe Notes, below) – this is a great time to prepare both of these components as well.)\n    \n    [![Raw cashews, garlic, chipotle pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika, ground cumin, lemon & lime juice, water, kosher salt & ground black pepper inside a high-speed blender carafe.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-10.jpg)](https://playswellwithbutter.com/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-with-chipotle-cashew-crema-10/)\n    \n    [![An overhead shot of blended chipotle cashew crema inside of an open high-speed blender carafe.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-12.jpg)](https://playswellwithbutter.com/roasted-sweet-potato-cauliflower-tacos-with-chipotle-cashew-crema-12/)\n    \n5.  **Assemble and serve:** Pile the roasted veggies and black beans into a tortilla, with smashed avocado and a good drizzle of cashew crema as desired. Finish with any other toppings of choice – cashew crema, chopped cilantro, lime juice, salsa – whatever your taco-lovin’ heart desires. Enjoy!![A close up shot of sweet potato tacos with cauliflower drizzled with chipotle cashew crema and fresh chopped cilantro arranged atop a parchment lined baking sheet pan.](https://playswellwithbutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roasted-Sweet-Potato-Cauliflower-Tacos-with-Chipotle-Cashew-Crema-16-595x397.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Ingredient Notes:**\n    *   **Cashews:** If you cannot find roasted, unsalted cashews, feel free to use raw cashews for your cashew crema. The consistency of your cashew crema will depend on how much juice your lime yields, so feel free to adjust as needed to reach your desired consistency (i.e. blend in more cashews for a thicker sauce, stir in a little more water for a thinner sauce). If you do not have a high-speed blender, you may want to soak your cashews for 10-15 minutes in boiling-hot water, which helps them break down much more easily in a less powerful blender. **_More tips and tricks!_** **⇢** [Easy Vegan Cashew Crema](https://playswellwithbutter.com/cashew-crema/).\n    *   **Charred corn tortillas:** To char corn tortillas on the stovetop, pop a tortilla directly over open flame on a gas burner. Once you see a little smoke coming off the tortilla, then continue to rotate it until it’s lightly charred. Continue until both sides of the tortillas are evenly charred. It’s very important not to over-do it as this will completely dry the tortillas out – just aim for a little color! Once it’s as charred as desired, transfer to a tortilla warmer or wrap it in a damp paper towel to prevent it from drying out until you’re ready to serve.\n*   **Storage and Reheating:** Leftover roasted sweet potatoes and cauliflower will keep, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for 3-5 days. Reheat leftovers in the microwave until warmed through, or under the broiler for 3-4 minutes if you like a little extra crispy-char. Leftover chipotle cashew crema will keep, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. Enjoy leftovers with more roasted veggie tacos, or use it as an all-purpose sauce for any other meals or salads. \n*   **15-Minute Meal Prep:** One of our favorite things about this roasted cauliflower sweet potato tacos recipe is how easy it is to throw together – especially if you’ve done a little bit of meal prep ahead of time. By chopping the veggies in advance, you can jump right into cooking during the week – easy! Here’s what you’ll do…\n    *   **_Roasted veggie prep:_** Chop the cauliflower and dice sweet potato according to the Ingredients List, above. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

    "markdown": "# Grandma’s Meat Sauce Pasta with Burrata — The Daley Plate\nThis little recipe isn’t complicated, doesn’t pretend to be something else. It has always been there in times when my grandmother knew she had to feed us cousins something we would actually eat after school. Using what she had in her pantry she created this easy meat sauce, but her hand was heavy and she often overseasoned. The large amount of pepper is what we as kids came to love and crave, even though we are now spread out around the world and it’s 20 years later. I’ve had many requests for the recipe, but struggled to share something I knew that Italian nonna’s might critcize for not being authentic. It is just a basic recipe that my South African grandma made from her heart, so please adjust whatever you like to your taste. The cloves aren’t really optional because it gives this dish that signature South African flavor (clove, mace, cinnamon and nutmeg are hugely popular ingredients in savory meat dishes!), just be sure to scoop it out before serving :) I can’t tell you how many times she forgot, and had one of us very shocked after biting into one. If you prefer some spice, add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and some hot smoked paprika. If you follow a vegetarian diet, I recommend trying plant based protein like Beyond products or soy mince. Burrata is entirely optional, you could either leave it out or use a nice shaving of Parmesan cheese.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 tbsp olive oil   \n1 large onion, finely minced  \n1/4 cup finely chopped green bell pepper  \n4 cloves garlic, finely minced  \n1 lb lean ground beef  \n1 1/2 tsp salt  \n2 tsp fresh black pepper  \n1 tbsp dried herbs (oregano, basil, rosemary)  \n1 tbsp tomato paste  \n4 cups crushed tomatoes (2 x 14.5 Oz cans OR 1 28 Oz)  \n1 tbsp sugar  \n2-3 whole cloves (the spice)  \n2 cups water or stock of your choice\n\n1 package cooked pasta of your choice, plus 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water  \nTo serve: Fresh parsley, burrata, cracked black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil\n\nGuidelines:\n\nSauté onions, green pepper and garlic using the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot until the onions are translucent (10 minutes). Add ground beef and brown, 5 minutes on medium heat. Add the salt, pepper, herbs and tomato paste. Continue to cook while stirring, 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the crushed tomatoes, cloves, sugar and water or stock - Turn heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring halfway through. The sauce should reduce somewhat and become darker in color. Remove cloves.\n\nAdd the cooked pasta to the sauce and mix through very gently with the heat on the lowest setting. My grandmother would add some of the pasta water to thin it out just a bit, then allow it to cook for 5 minutes more and add an optional tbsp of butter to make the sauce glisten. The best part for us was that the pasta was tender having soaked up all the sauce.\n\nPlate and top with pieces of burrata, fresh pepper, olive oil and fresh parsley.\n\nServes 4-6"

    "markdown": "# Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower - Kirbie's Cravings\nJanuary 19, 2016\n\nby Kirbie\n\nHoney Garlic Cauliflower is an easy and delicious weeknight meal. Crunchy baked breaded cauliflower pieces are coated with honey garlic sauce.\n\n![photo of honey being drizzled over a bowl of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PeLMcZclikA/Vp3ka9dlv6I/AAAAAAAFQeA/fO_aoGOBt90/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-9.jpg)\n\nI can’t get enough of this honey garlic sauce. It’s savory, spicy, and sweet, all at the same time. And crunchy bites of cauliflower are the perfect vehicle for soaking up the thick sauce. The sauce is so versatile, too. I’ve used it to make [Honey Garlic Shrimp](https://kirbiecravings.com/honey-garlic-shrimp/) which are delicious, too.\n\nLast week we had a pretty packed schedule. Dinners with out-of-town friends, a wedding rehearsal dinner, a weekend trip for my friend’s wedding, and more. Now we’re trying to get back to a normal and healthier eating schedule. It’s definitely hard, but this tasty honey garlic cauliflower dish made things a little easier. This sauce was so delicious that I was tempted to lick my bowl clean.\n\nI like that you can serve this dish as a side dish, appetizer, or snack. We also make it as a main dish. It’s great with cooked rice or [cauliflower rice](https://kirbiecravings.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice/). \n\n![close-up photo of a piece of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-metlEgKiXpo/Vp3rOS02qxI/AAAAAAAFQeY/DyPKj5yj3E4/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-015.jpg)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   Cauliflower florets\n*   Panko bread crumbs\n*   Cooking spray\n*   Whisked eggs\n*   Sliced scallions or green onions\n*   Honey\n*   Minced garlic\n*   Onion powder\n*   Cornstarch and water\n*   Soy sauce\n*   Sriracha sauce\n\n**Cauliflower:** I use one small head of cauliflower and break it down into bite-sized florets. The florets should be about the same size so they cook evenly.\n\n**Panko:** I always measure out a little more panko than I think I’ll need because it’s easier to coat the cauliflower if there’s extra in the bowl.\n\n**Cornstarch:** This thickens the sauce. Before you add it, you will mix it with some water to dissolve it. This cornstarch mixture prevents the cornstarch from clumping up when you add it to the sauce.\n\n**Soy sauce:** I like to use low-sodium soy sauce.\n\n**Sriracha:** You can use your favorite hot sauce that is similar.\n\n![overhead photo of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9nluamvtSyo/Vp3rP0Ec9kI/AAAAAAAFQek/JK6FiktGXBs/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-009.jpg)\n\nRecipe Tips\n-----------\n\nIf the head of cauliflower you use is larger, you should double the sauce so there’s enough to coat the florets.\n\nThe sauce is very flexible, so you can adjust the ingredients to your liking. Sometimes I add more soy sauce or I add different seasonings. If you add more liquid, just be sure to increase the amount of cornstarch so your sauce is thick enough.\n\nIf you want to serve this as a main dish, you can add a cooked vegetable, green salad, or rice on the side.\n\n![close-up photo of a bowl of Honey Garlic Baked Cauliflower](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ejsD_bZLmgs/Vp3kZwOcLkI/AAAAAAAFQeA/lrTYTT1a-XA/s800-Ic42/honey-garlic-baked-cauliflower-5.jpg)\n\nMore Cauliflower Recipes\n------------------------\n\n*   [Baked Orange Cauliflower](https://kirbiecravings.com/2015/06/baked-orange-cauliflower.html)\n*   [Lemon Cauliflower](https://kirbiecravings.com/2016/10/lemon-cauliflower.html)\n*   [Bang Bang Cauliflower](https://kirbiecravings.com/2015/01/bang-bang-cauliflower.html)\n*   [Cauliflower Tots](https://kirbiecravings.com/cauliflower-tots/)\n*   [Buffalo Cauliflower Bites](https://kirbiecravings.com/buffalo-cauliflower-bites/)\n\nRecipe now updated with video!

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread panko crumbs in a thin even layer across the surface of the baking sheet. Spray panko crumbs with cooking oil spray. Bake crumbs about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. \n    \n*   Set whisked eggs aside in a small bowl. Line another large baking sheet with parchment paper.\n    \n*   Dip cauliflower in egg mixture and then shake a few times so that excess egg drips off. You don't want to dampen your breadcrumbs with excess egg because then they won't stick to the cauliflower. Then place into sheet with panko crumbs. Cover cauliflower with panko, pressing the crumbs gently against the cauliflower to help them stick. Place coated cauliflower on empty prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all cauliflower is coated. \n    \n*   Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until cauliflower is cooked and the coating is a dark golden brown. \n    \n*   While the cauliflower is cooking, make sauce on the stove. In a small bowl, completely dissolve cornstarch in water and set aside. \n    \n*   Add all sauce ingredients except the cornstarch + water to a small pot or saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer and stir a few times until ingredients are mixed. This should only take a few seconds. Then add cornstarch water to the sauce. Stir immediately to dissolve cornstarch into the sauce. Stir occasionally and let sauce come to a simmer (make sure to stir otherwise the cornstarch will clump up) and cook until sauce starts to thicken (about 2 minutes). \n    \n*   Allow sauce to cool a few minutes and thicken even more. Drizzle over cauliflower. If you wish to completely coat cauliflower in sauce, it's best to double the sauce and brush it on with a pastry brush. Garnish with scallions.\n    \n\n*   You most likely won't need all of the panko breadcrumbs, but to ensure the cauliflower is completely coated it's easier to start with more than you need. The nutrition estimate was calculated with 1 cup of panko and does not include the excess.\n*   The recipe above makes just enough sauce to drizzle over a small head's worth of cauliflower florets. If you are using a medium or large head of cauliflower or you wish to coat the cauliflower completely in sauce, you should double the sauce.\n*   If you make any adjustments to the sauce (i.e. add more soy sauce or other liquids) you may need to also add more cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Remember to dissolve any additional cornstarch in a little water before adding it.\n\nServing: 0.25of recipe, Calories: 227kcal, Carbohydrates: 43g, Protein: 7g, Fat: 3g, Saturated Fat: 1g, Sodium: 416mg, Fiber: 2g, Sugar: 28g, NET CARBS: 41\n\nThe nutrition information provided are only estimates based on an online nutritional calculator.

It is packed with nutrition and flavor and you’ll love the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing!\n\nI typically go crazy with pumpkin recipes as soon as fall hits, but today I have a pumpkin-less recipe that features more fall produce favorites – butternut squash, apples and greens. I’ve been eating these things separately or in other dishes, but finally decided to throw them all together for a tasty meal-sized salad.\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples.

If you like my [garlicky kale salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/garlicky-kale/), you’ll love this one because the dressing is almost exactly the same – I just added a little maple syrup to sweeten it up a bit.

It’s naturally gluten-free, high in protein and one of few plant foods that contain all nine essential amino acids ([source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-quinoa)). Not only that, but it’s also high in fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin E and various beneficial antioxidants!

You’ll need 1 1/2 cups of cooked quinoa which is 1/2 cup dry quinoa.\n*   **butternut squash** – cut the squash into uniform, bite-size pieces so they roast evenly.\n*   **apple** –  I prefer to use Honeycrisp, Pink Lady or Fuji apples, but any variety will work. Uniform, bite sized pieces are ideal here too so you can get a bite with all the flavors together!\n*   **pepitas** – pepitas are pumpkin seeds without the shell, but if you can’t find them you can use regular pumpkin seeds or even pecans for a nice added crunch. Roast them alongside the butternut squash for a roasted flavor boost.\n*   **dried cranberries** – I love adding dried fruit to my salads for a little touch of sweetness and texture. Raisins would also be great in this recipe.\n*   **tahini apple cider vinegar dressing** – tahini, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, tamari, nutritional yeast, garlic and a touch of maple syrup make up this delicious salad dressing.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest salad in a glass bowl being tossed with the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-3.jpg)\n\nSteps to Build This Salad\n-------------------------\n\n**Prep butternut squash** – Prepare the squash by peeling it, cutting it in half and scraping out the seeds, then cut the squash into bite-size cubes. You can also buy pre-cut butternut squash to skip this step! Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and roast at 400°F for 30-40 minutes, turning once or twice, until all the pieces are tender and have a few small brown spots.\n\n**Roast pepitas** – If your pepitas or pecans are raw, you can toast them in the oven with the roasting squash. Spread seeds/nuts on a separate baking sheet and add to the oven with the butternut squash for 5 to 10 minutes or until the seeds/nuts are golden and crunchy, then remove from the pan to cool. Be sure to watch the seeds/nuts carefully because they can burn quickly. The pepitas will take less time to toast than the pecans because they’re smaller.\n\n**Assemble salad** – While roasting the squash, toss together spinach, cooked quinoa, apple and cranberries in a large salad bowl. Add cooled pepitas (or pecans) once they’ve been toasted. Once the butternut squash is done roasting, allow it to cool and then place into the salad bowl with the other ingredients.\n\n**Make dressing** – While while butternut squash is roasting, prepare the dressing by placing all remaining ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n**Serve** – Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.\n\n![Tossed fall harvest spinach salad in a glass bowl with wooden spoons.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nSwitch it up!\n-------------\n\nYou can easily swap some of the ingredients in this salad and get an entirely different meal that will be equally delicious!\n\n*   **Baby spinach** – use another dark, leafy green like kale or collard greens. Arugula is a great salad base as well.\n*   **Butternut squash** – try [roasted sweet potatoes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/coconut-oil-roasted-sweet-potatoes/) instead, or even [cinnamon maple roasted Kabocha Squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-roasted-kabocha-squash/).\n*   **Apple** – instead of apple, you could use pears or even [jicama](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/jicama-nutrition-benefits).\n*   **Pepitas** – as mentioned above, you can also use pumpkin seeds or pecans. The idea here is to add some crunch so any kind of nut or seed will do!\n*   **Dried cranberries** – raisins or dried cherries would also be tasty!\n\nHow to Serve Fall Quinoa Spinach Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nFor me, this is a meal-sized salad I would eat on its own. But it would also make a great side salad if you want to serve it to more people! Here are some great ideas to serve alongside this salad:\n\n*   [Apple Cider Vinegar Chicken](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/apple-cider-vinegar-chicken/)\n*   [Pumpkin Spice Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/pumpkin-spice-salmon/)\n*   [Eggplant Casserole with Ground Turkey](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/eggplant-casserole/)\n*   [Maple Glazed Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-soy-broiled-salmon/)\n*   [Butternut Squash Soup](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/butternut-squash-soup/)\n*   [Healthy Turkey Chili](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/turkey-chili/)\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples.

I start with a few ingredients and then I keep adding more and adding more. I just can’t stop! I figure, we need to make the most of summer and enjoy ALL of the freshest produce we possibly can. I don’t want any fruits and veggies to feel left out:) Plus, we need to be tasting the rainbow every day!\n\nThis **Summer Farro Salad** is summer perfection.

If you haven’t had farro, you really need to join the farro fan club. It is one of my favorite whole grains. It is similar to barley in texture and has a nutty flavor. It is a good source of fiber, protein, magnesium, and iron.\n\nI like to cook farro on Sunday so I can add it to my salads all week long. This way it is already cooked and ready to go. Farro is easy to meal prep, just keep it in the fridge in a container until you are ready to use it. It will last all week. You can also freeze it for up to a month.\n\nAll of Your Favorite Summer Ingredients\n---------------------------------------\n\nI love this salad because it is loaded with summer goodness. It makes a great side dish to any meal, but it is hearty enough to be the meal. I often eat this salad for lunch and it always hits the spot! The salad ingredients include:\n\n*   farro\n*   greens (use your favorite)\n*   peaches\n*   blueberries\n*   tomatoes\n*   sweet corn\n*   basil\n*   feta cheese\n*   lemon dressing\n\nYep, this salad screams summer!

Cook the farro according to package instructions. Pro tip-Trader Joe’s sells quick cooking farro that will save you some time and it’s really good.\n*   Use the freshest produce you can find. This is a summer salad so it should be easy! Shop your farmers market or get the ingredients from your garden, or your neighbor’s garden:)\n*   You don’t have to cook the sweet corn. Just cut of the corn kernels with a sharp knife and add the corn to the salad. Raw corn is so good!\n*   You can use grape or cherry tomatoes for this salad. If you have larger garden tomatoes that you need to use up, you can chop them and add them to the salad.\n*   Use your favorite greens, kale, spinach, mixed greens or arugula are all great options.\n*   I love the addition of feta cheese, but goat cheese would be good too! If you need the salad to be vegan or dairy-free you can leave out the cheese. It will still have plenty of flavor.\n*   If you need the salad to be gluten-free, you can use quinoa instead of farro.\n*   Feel free to throw in additional herbs from your garden. Fresh mint and chives would be nice.\n\nOk, are you guys ready to ROCK your summer salad? You are going to LOVE this one! If you take it to a summer potluck, I bet everyone will beg you for the recipe and you will leave with an empty bowl. It is a summer star!\n\n### More Summer Salads\n\n*   [Black Bean Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/black-bean-salad/)\n*   [Easy Pasta Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/easy-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Southwest Pasta Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/southwest-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Blueberry Corn Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/blueberry-corn-salad/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken Blueberry Feta Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/grilled-chicken-blueberry-feta-salad-with-lemon-poppy-seed-dressing/)\n*   [Tomato Peach and Corn Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/tomato-peach-corn-salad/)\n\n![Easy Summer Farro Salad](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMMER-FARRO-SALAD-4.jpg \"Summer Farro Salad With All Of The Best Summer Ingredients: Peaches, Blueberries, Corn, Tomatoes, And Basil.

It’s sweet from the peaches and blueberries, a little salty from the feta and has a fresh crisp crunch from the Persian cucumbers.\n\nThe salad is tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and is an absolute dream to eat on a hot summer day!

Serving spoons are next to the salad and a bowl of the vinaigrette is behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photo-680x967.jpg)\n\nHow To Make Blueberry Peach Feta Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nMaking this salad is as easy as making a simple everyday lettuce salad. Dice the peaches, slice the cucumbers, and add them to a serving bowl along with the blueberries.\n\nWhenever I make a recipe with feta, I prefer to use block feta and crumble it myself. I feel that the flavor is better, it isn’t as dry and it doesn’t have any of the anti-caking agent in it that pre-crumbled and pre-shredded cheeses contain. For this salad recipe you can crumble or cube the feta cheese.\n\n ![A gray bowl filled with lemon basil vinaigrette.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-picture-680x974.jpg)\n\nThe final step is to make the lemon vinaigrette. Combine the lemon juice, dijon, honey, olive oil, salt and pepper in a jar. Thinly slice the fresh basil, otherwise known as chiffonade and add it into the mix. Screw on the lid and shake it until it’s well combined. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad and gently toss everything together. You can eat the salad immediately or refrigerate it until you’re ready to serve.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photographs-680x1008.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can I make the salad vegan?**\n\nYes. Simply omit the feta and substitute the honey in the lemon vinaigrette with maple syrup. You can also add a can of chickpeas to the salad to make it heartier.\n\n**How long will the salad keep?**\n\nThe salad keeps for a couple days in the refrigerator. You will notice that the peaches will get softer and the feta will start to break down the longer it’s in the fridge, but it still taste great.\n\n**Can I make the salad ahead of time?**\n\nParts of the salad can be made ahead of time. You can cut the peaches and combine them with the cucumbers and blueberries a day ahead of time. The vinaigrette can be made several days ahead of time. I would wait until the day you plan to eat the salad to add in the fresh basil, feta and toss the salad in the vinaigrette.\n\n ![closeup photo of Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers and basil.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photos-680x1012.jpg)\n\nIngredient Substitutions\n------------------------\n\n*   **Peaches** – If you aren’t a fan of peaches, substitute them with nectarines.\n*   **Feta** – Goat cheese is a good substitution for feta. You could also use [queso fresco](https://www.thekitchn.com/queso-fresco-the-cheesemonger-91408) or [ricotta salata](https://www.belgioioso.com/Products/Ricotta-Salata)\n*   **Persian Cucumbers** – I love to use Persian cucumbers, which may also be called snacking cucumbers, because they’re extra crunchy and you don’t have to peel them. If you can’t find these, use an English cucumber instead. You may want to scoop out the seeds if you go this route, but you won’t need to peel it.\n*   **Blueberries** – Strawberries or blackberries would be a good substitute for blueberries. As with the blueberries and peaches, make sure they are the sweetest and freshest ones you can find to have the best results with this salad. You may find that the strawberries don’t hold up as long in the salad and get soft.\n*   **Honey** – Substitute with maple syrup.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl with a bowl of lemon basil dressing behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photograph-680x971.jpg)\n\nMore Peach Salad Recipes\n------------------------\n\n*   [Peach Tomato Caprese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-caprese-salad/)\n*   [Summer Chickpea Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken, Peach, Pecan and Goat Cheese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-chicken-peach-pecan-goat-cheese-salad/)\n*   [Peach, Tomato and Corn Panzanella](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-corn-panzanella/)\n*   [Summer Vegetable Orzo Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-vegetable-orzo-salad/)\n\n**Prep Time** 15 minutes\n\n**Total Time** 15 minutes\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 pint fresh blueberries\n*   2 peaches, diced\n*   2 Persian cucumbers, sliced\n*   1/2 cup crumbled feta\n*   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tablespoon dijon mustard\n*   1 tablespoon honey\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   1 tablespoon finely chopped basil\n*   Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/privacy-policy/).\n\nPeaches are one of my favorite fruits this time of year and this peach salad is the perfect way to enjoy this juicy stone fruit. Finished with a sweet and tangy olive oil dressing, it’s super quick and easy to make and impressive to serve!\n\n![Large bowl of summer peach salad with spinach and avocado with large serving spoon inside](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Peach-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nIngredients for making peach salad\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **Peaches:** Peaches not only add an amazing color and sweetness to this salad, but they are loaded with nutrients and antioxidants. They are a great source of vitamins A and C as well as iron and folate. Get my top tips for [cutting peaches](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/how-to-cut-a-peach/).\n*   **Spinach:** I like to use baby spinach for the base of this salad, but lots of other greens will work well. Arugula, romaine or butter lettuce will all make nice additions.\n*   **Avocado:** Sliced avocado adda a lovely creamy texture as well as being a great source of healthy fatty acids.\n*   **Feta:** This Greek cheese adds a nice slight saltiness to help balance out the other ingredients.\n*   **Pecans:** I like to add pecans to the salad to add texture. Walnuts or almonds would also work well.\n*   **Basil leaves:** Basil and peaches work so well together and they add a nice herby freshness.\n*   **Dressing:** Olive oil, red wine vinegar, honey, salt and pepper.\n\n![Ingredients to make the recipe](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Peach-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nMaking the salad\n----------------\n\nTo assemble the salad, I recommend laying the spinach or greens in a large bowl first, adding the peaches, then drizzling the dressing and finally, adding the toppings. You can toss the salad, but the presentation of it is much better un-tossed.\n\n![Large bowl of spinach and peaches with avocados, basil, pecans, feta cheese and dressing on the side](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Peach-Salad-2.jpg)\n\nTips for making a peach salad\n-----------------------------\n\n1.  **Use perfectly ripe peaches for the best flavor.** Squeeze the peaches, gently but firmly, if they give a little they are good to use.\n2.  **Wash and dry your greens well.** If you have one, use a salad spinner to get rid of excess water or pat the leaves dry with kitchen paper. Excess moisture will pool in the bottom of the bowl and you will get a soggy salad.\n3.  **Make this dish vegan.** Simply swap the honey in the dressing for maple syrup and skip the feta cheese.\n4.  **Make extra salad dressing.** The sweet red wine vinaigrette will work well with all of your favorite salads and will keep well for up to 7 days, so you can use it throughout the week.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can you make this salad ahead of time?**\n\nThis salad is best served as soon as it is made as the dressing will start to wilt the spinach leaves. If you like, you can build the salad the day before and keep it covered in the fridge. Add the dressing just before serving.\n\n**What else can you add to this salad?**\n\nThis salad is a great side dish, but it’s really easy to turn it into a full meal. Add some [Oven Baked Chicken Breast](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/oven-baked-chicken-breast/), [Grilled Shrimp](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/grilled-shrimp-skewers/) or chickpeas to add some extra protein.\n\n![Large bowl of peach salad with sliced avocados](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Peach-Salad-3.jpg)\n\nThis easy peach salad is so great to enjoy throughout the summer. It’s perfectly fresh and vibrant and is so refreshing.

Ideally, you want the fruit ripe enough to where it’s sweet, but not so ripe that it’s mushy once cut.\n\nThis salad is especially good with in-season peaches and tomatoes if you have access to them!\n\n![Juicy fresh peaches and all the caprese salad fixins' come together in this summery peach caprese salad! Fast to prepare and perfect for a quick summer side dish.](https://wholeandheavenlyoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peach-Caprese-Salad-Closeup.jpg)\n\n### Tips for Perfect Peach Caprese Salad\n\n1.  **Toss peaches with a bit of lemon juice if storing –** do this if you plan to store the salad in the fridge for awhile before serving. The acidity from the lemon juice keeps the peaches from browning.\n2.  **Toast almonds –** this adds a lot of flavor and gives the nuts a perfect crunch.\n3.  **Add basil and almonds just before serving –** basil is best if used immediately after it’s been cut, as it tends to turn brown and lose freshness.\n4.  **Dress salad just before serving –** this will keep the greens perfectly crisp.\n\n### Recipe Variations\n\nThis recipe is easy to adapt into something new! Try these ideas…\n\n*   **Choose another green –** try spinach, romaine, or another fresh green in place of the spring mix.\n*   **Try another fruit –** fresh cherries, nectarines, peaches, or strawberries would be delicious in place of the peaches.\n*   **Swap out the cheese –** try regular sliced fresh mozzarella, feta, or burrata.\n*   **Skip the nuts –** simply omit the almonds to make this a nut-free salad.\n\n### Storing the Salad\n\nIf you plan to store this salad, store it separately from the dressing, basil, and toasted almonds. Assemble only just before serving.\n\nThe salad will keep in the fridge about 4 days and the dressing will keep about 1 week.\n\n![Juicy fresh peaches and all the caprese salad fixins' come together in this summery peach caprese salad!

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_This Butter Cauliflower Recipe is a vegetarian riff on the classic Indian dish, Butter Chicken. In this version, tender cauliflower florets are simmered in a spiced cream sauce and served over rice with yogurt. A cozy weeknight dinner the whole family will love._ ![Vegetarian Butter Cauliflower recipe served over basmati rice with yogurt and naan](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower3.jpg)\n\nThe Best Butter Cauliflower Recipe:\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt’s official, cauliflower has hit its peak. In this Butter Cauliflower recipe, the versatile veggie takes on bright, vibrant flavors, and creates the heartiest homemade version of a classic. Serve it over rice, quinoa, or your grain of choice for a gluten free, vegetarian bowl of BLISS.\n\nIn its purest form, Butter Chicken consists of chunks of chicken marinated in a yogurt-and-spice mixture. The chicken gets simmered in a luxuriously creamy sauce comprising tomatoes, aromatics, a wealth of spices, and butter. This dish differs from Tikka Masala in that its more creamy than spicy, however Butter Chicken can still pack a fiery punch.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite Indian dishes because it truly has the power to warm you from the inside out. It’s also incredibly versatile, and you’ll notice most versions has varying ratios of spice.\n\nButter Cauliflower is best served with a side of naan to sop up any remaining sauce. It also makes the BEST leftovers once the flavors really have a chance to develop and marry. In short, it’s the kind of dish I could eat on repeat and never tire of.![Cauliflower florets simmered in a spiced curry sauce with cream and cilantro](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower2.jpg)![A vegetarian version of Butter Chicken made with cauliflower](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower6.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Butter Chicken Vegetarian:\n--------------------------------------\n\nCauliflower is one of the best plant-based subs for chicken in this recipe. However, in order to achieve the meatiest texture, the cauliflower requires a couple extra steps.\n\n*   First, sear the cauliflower florets in a skillet until slightly softened.\n*   Next, toss them in a corn starch, lemon juice, and spice mixture. Since classic Butter Chicken is marinaded in yogurt and spices, this step mimics the same acid + spice infusion. The corn starch will also help create a crust on the cauli, helping it retain its texture after being simmered in the sauce.\n\nAs far as spices, the classic lineup includes garam masala, ginger, cumin, fenugreek, and chiles. Some versions may also call for coriander, cardamom, turmeric, and paprika.\n\nIn addition, Butter Chicken always calls for butter, tomatoes, and cream, which compose the base of the sauce. In this version, I try to keep the spices relatively streamlined (turmeric, cumin, paprika, ginger, etc.), however garam masala is a must!\n\nIncase you’re not familiar, garam masala is a super fragrant spice blend that includes many of the above mentioned ingredinets. The main difference between garam masala and curry powder is that it does not include turmeric. For this reason, garam masala tends to taste a bit sweeter, more floral, and less earthy.![Crispy cauliflower florets marinaded and pan-seared](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower.jpg)![A vegetarian version of Butter Chicken using cauliflower](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower4.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with Butter Cauliflower:\n--------------------------------------\n\nI love serving this dish over basmati rice with a side of naan. However if you’re looking to add some protein, I recommend serving it over quinoa or tossing in some chickpeas.\n\nSwirling in a dollop of Greek yogurt at the end also ups the protein ante. Plus, it makes the sauce even creamier and balances the spice. This recipe is quite filling on its own between the fiber and satiating fats, though feel free to adjust and make it your own!\n\nTo finish off, add some fresh cilantro sprigs and a spritz of lemon juice!\n\nAnd, as always, if you give this recipe a try, be sure to tag #dishingouthealth so I can see your beautiful creations!\n\nOther Healthy Cauliflower Recipes to Try:\n-----------------------------------------\n\n#### [BBQ Cauliflower Tacos with Green Tahini Sauce](https://dishingouthealth.com/bbq-cauliflower-tacos-with-green-tahini-sauce/)\n\n#### [Cauliflower Burrito Bowls with Jalapeño Ranch](https://dishingouthealth.com/cauliflower-burrito-bowls-with-jalapeno-ranch/)\n\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice\n*   ▢ 2 tsp. corn starch\n*   ▢ 1/2 tsp. ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 tsp. ground turmeric divided\n*   ▢ 3 tsp. garam masala divided\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tsp. salt divided\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. olive oil divided\n*   ▢ 1 medium head of cauliflower cut into florets\n*   ▢ 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter\n*   ▢ 1 yellow onion finely chopped\n*   ▢ 3 garlic cloves minced\n*   ▢ 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger sub ground ginger\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. tomato paste\n*   ▢ 1 tsp. paprika\n*   ▢ 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ Pinch of cayenne pepper optional\n*   ▢ 1 8-oz. can tomato sauce\n*   ▢ 2 cups vegetable broth\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup heavy cream sub full-fat canned coconut milk\n*   ▢ Basmati rice for serving\n*   ▢ Fresh cilantro and whole-milk Greek yogurt for garnish\n\n*   Combine lemon juice, corn starch, cumin, and 1/2 tsp each of turmeric, garam masala, and salt in a large bowl.

It should be dull. If it's shiny, it's probably overripe.\n*   Choose one that has no soft spots or signs of damage.\n*   The melon should be fairly heavy for its size.\n*   Most importantly, find the end where it was joined to the vine and have a sniff.

    "markdown": "# Best EVER Spinach Orzo Salad - Barefeet In The Kitchen\nThis Spinach Orzo Salad is filled with cranberries, creamy goat cheese, tender pasta, and plenty of fresh spinach tossed in a tangy sweet dressing. The salad can be served immediately or kept in the refrigerator for 2-3 days – making this an awesome make-ahead meal for lunch or dinner.\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese in mixing bowl](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-6-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n#### Spinach Salad with Cranberries\n\nThe recipe was inspired by the Cranberry Orzo Salad that Princess Cruises serves in their International Cafe. It’s just so good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh, and delicious.\n\nI’ve included more cruise details at the bottom of the post here for anyone who is interested. As soon as I got home from [our cruise through the British Isles](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/monets-garden/), I immediately recreated the salad for my family.\n\nAs always, I loved the salad, but my guys? The kids decided that the fresh cranberries were too tart. (Crazy kids!)\n\nSo, the next time I made the salad, I went with dried cranberries and it was a win across the board. I like this salad every bit as much with dried cranberries as I do with fresh cranberries – and that’s an even bigger win, since fresh cranberries aren’t available more than a few weeks a year.\n\n(And unless you’re lucky enough to have [cranberries stashed in the freezer for this cake](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/cranberry-christmas-cake/), you’ll be stuck waiting until the holidays to try this awesome salad.)\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese - close up photo](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-2-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\nI took our salad to the next level by adding a generous portion of fresh baby spinach and warm chicken. Both the chicken and the spinach made it a heartier meal for my family.\n\nAnd as far as my guys are concerned, when I include meat that immediately elevates a pasta salad from side dish to main dish status.\n\nFor what it’s worth though, the chicken in this salad really is optional, the salad is delicious without it. I might even prefer it that way myself.\n\n![spinach salad with orzo, cranberries, and goat cheese](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-3-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\n### Spinach Orzo Salad Recipe\n\n_You’ll need the following ingredients to make this:_\n\n*   olive oil\n*   orzo pasta\n*   baby spinach\n*   sliced almonds\n*   dried cranberries\n*   crumbled goat cheese\n*   chicken, optional\n\n**Dressing Ingredients**\n\n*   olive oil\n*   white balsamic vinegar\n*   honey\n*   salt and pepper\n\n_I’ve used both plain goat cheese and a honey goat cheese for this pasta and they’re both delicious._\n\n_However, I really loved the added flavor from the hint of honey in the specialty goat cheese. If you can find it at your store, give it a try!_\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with almonds and cranberries](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-4-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n### Orzo Spinach Salad\n\nTo make this salad, you’ll begin by toasting the orzo over medium heat, about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add 4 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer, and cover with a lid for 7-8 minutes. Drain any liquid, fluff with fork.\n\nPlace the spinach in a large mixing bowl. Add the cooked orzo, cranberries, almonds, and cooked chicken – if desired.\n\nIn a small bowl or large measuring cup, combine the oil, vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well to coat.\n\nTop with goat cheese and toss lightly. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\n\n![orzo salad with spinach ](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-5-1-of-1-732x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Easy Salads with Spinach\n\nFresh sweet berries, crisp greens, crunchy pecans and a drizzle of creamy poppyseed dressing all add up to one of our favorite summer berry salads. While my boys haven’t always been the biggest salad fans, when this [Berry Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/berry-salad-recipe/) and [Poppyseed Dressing](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/creamy-poppyseed-dressing-recipe/) are on the table they are very happy to eat their salads.\n\nCrisp baby spinach, spring mix lettuces, tart apples, sweet raisins, crunchy almonds, and the ultimate honey cider salad dressing are combined to create a fantastic [Spinach Apple Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/carvers-salad-with-honey-cider-dressing/).\n\n[Strawberry Spinach Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/strawberry-spinach-salad/) is the perfect salad for a summer night. Packed with fresh greens and sweet strawberries, this salad is finished with sliced almonds for just the right amount of crunch.\n\nThis [Spinach Pasta Salad with Tomatoes](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/spinach-pasta-salad-recipe/) is a tangy, garlicky, peppery pasta salad that I can’t seem to stop making and eating on repeat.

After hearing about it so much, the next time it was available, I had to try it.\n\nIt was so very good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh. and delicious.\n\nThe [International Cafe](https://www.princess.com/ships-and-experience/ships/products/dining-included/international-cafe.html) is part of the all-inclusive dining options onboard each cruise ship. The cafe is open 24 hours a day and it’s one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat each time we cruise.\n\nThe morning selections include pastries and fresh croissants, breakfast sandwiches, quiche, fresh fruit, yogurt parfaits, and more. Later in the day, you’ll find a selection of small-bite meals and other sweet and savory treats.\n\nThe selections change daily, so when you find your favorite food there, you’ll want to make the most of it.\n\nAsk me how I know this? <_cough> Nutella donuts <cough>_ I cruised 3x before I managed to snag a much-talked-about Nutella donut and it didn’t disappoint. I’ve learned now to check the selections daily.\n\nEdited to add: I cruised the Caribbean with my sister Jenny a couple of years ago and as soon as we were on the ship for our last cruise (literally, as soon as we embarked), she and I stopped by the International Cafe and picked up some of the pasta salad, along with a sandwich, and a couple of coffees to take to our room and snack on as we were getting unpacked and settled.\n\nI’m happy to tell you that Princess’s Cranberry Orzo Salad was every bit as delicious as I remembered. And fortunately, now we can all enjoy it at home too.\n\nWant to check out more of our [Medallion Class cruise](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/ocean-medallion/) through the Caribbean?

Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again.\n\nWatch the Video\n---------------\n\n![Arugula Salad with Couscous Recipe Video](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Arugula-Salad-with-Couscous-Recipe-Video.jpg)\n\n**Related:** We love adding couscous to salads, here’s our [lemon and herb couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12689/lemon-and-herb-couscous-salad-recipe/) with tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\nOur Favorite Arugula Salad\n--------------------------\n\nIt’s funny how certain recipes sneak their way into your weekly rotation. This arugula and couscous salad has done just that. We make it for dinner, eat the leftovers for lunch, and have served it to friends more times than I can count.\n\nYou’ll be itching to make it again once you try this arugula salad recipe. The salad is **simple, fast, and tastes like it came from a fancy restaurant**. Here’s the rundown on how to make it:\n\n![Lemon Arugula and Couscous Salad with Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1-1200.jpg)\n\n**The base of our salad is couscous** — we particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous). It cooks quickly and **gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself**. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, barley, or other grains — farro is excellent in salads (see our [apple, arugula, and farro salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/43230/farro-salad-with-apples/) for inspiration).\n\nAdd crisp **cucumbers**, baby **arugula** (or other tender greens), and **feta** cheese to the couscous. The lemon vinaigrette is simple — just lemon juice, olive oil, and a little honey.\n\n**Tip:** Since the dressing is so simple, it’s easy to play with. If we have it on hand, we love throwing a tablespoon of minced preserved lemon to the party. You can buy it or make your own — we shared this [recipe for preserved lemon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/5543/olives-with-lemon-confit-and-chili-flakes/) a while back if you want to take a look.\n\n![Adding lemon vinaigrette to couscous for the arugula and couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arugula-Salad-Recipe-3-1200.jpg)\n\n**The real trick to this salad is assembling it:** toss most of the dressing with the warm couscous and let it cool slightly before adding other ingredients. We take the same approach when making potato salad (we toss warm potatoes with the dressing first). By doing this, the warm ingredient has a chance to absorb all the flavor in the dressing. A game changer.\n\nThe same idea applies if you swap the couscous for pasta or another grain. Toss the still-warm pasta/grain with the dressing first, let it absorb, and cool slightly. Then, move on to adding the rest of the ingredients.\n\n**This arugula salad would go really well next to** this [Seriously Good Turkey Burger](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/34790/seriously-good-turkey-burger/), our [Easy Lemon Garlic Baked Chicken Breasts](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28703/lemon-garlic-baked-chicken-breast-recipe/) and our [Perfectly Baked Salmon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/149/moms-oven-poached-salmon/) (inspired by my Mom).\n\n![Lemon Arugula Salad with Couscous, Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1200.jpg)\n\n**For more arugula recipes**, take a look at our [Fried Goat Cheese, Strawberry and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/648/fried-goat-cheese-arugula-salad/), our [Lemony White Bean and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/42176/white-bean-salad/), this lovely [Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad Recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12907/shaved-fennel-and-arugula-salad-recipe/) and these [Baked Chicken Thighs with Potatoes, Garlic and Arugula](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28824/baked-chicken-thighs-with-potatoes/).\n\nLemon Arugula Salad with Couscous and Feta\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   PREP 10mins\n*   COOK 10mins\n*   TOTAL 20mins\n\nOur arugula salad, made with an easy lemon vinaigrette, pearl couscous, cucumbers, and feta, is crave-worthy. Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again. We particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous) for this arugula salad. It cooks quickly and gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, or other cooked grains like barley or wheat berries.\n\nMakes 4 large servings\n\nWatch Us Make the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nYou Will Need\n-------------\n\nFor the Salad\n\n1 ½ cups dried pearl (Israeli) couscous, _about 3 cups cooked_\n\n3 ounces baby arugula or tender salad greens, _about 4 cups_\n\nHalf of a hothouse (seedless) cucumber, chopped\n\n2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled, _about 1/2 cup_\n\nFor the Dressing\n\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, _about 1/2 large lemon_\n\n4 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup\n\n1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon, _optional_\n\n1 teaspoon dried basil or a handful chopped fresh basil leaves, _optional_\n\nSea salt and fresh ground black pepper\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n1Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add couscous and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, then add to a large bowl.\n\n2Meanwhile, make the lemon vinaigrette. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, honey, preserved lemon, and basil until it looks thick and blended. Season to taste with salt and fresh ground black pepper (we add a generous pinch of each).\n\n3Toss the cooked and drained couscous with the dressing, then set aside for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly. Finish the salad by adding the arugula, cucumbers, and feta. Toss well, then serve.\n\nAdam and Joanne's Tips\n----------------------\n\n*   The salad will keep overnight in the fridge. As it sits, the greens may wilt slightly, but still will taste great.\n*   If you cannot find pearl (Israeli) couscous, substitute with a regular couscous, small pasta shape such as orzo or cooked grains like quinoa, wheat berries and barley.\n*   Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates.

    "markdown": "# Lemon Orzo Salad with Chicken • Salt & Lavender\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://www.saltandlavender.com/privacy-policy/).\n\nThis **lemon orzo salad** recipe is a fresh, healthy, and colorful summer salad that’s a breeze to make! It’s ready in about 30 minutes.\n\nTry this [Easy Italian Pasta Salad](https://www.saltandlavender.com/easy-italian-pasta-salad-recipe/) for another quick summer salad recipe.\n\n![lemon orzo salad in a white bowl](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-1-720x1080.jpg)\n\nWhy you’ll love it\n------------------\n\nOrzo is extremely popular lately, so I’m thrilled to bring you even more recipes with it. You loved this [Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup](https://www.saltandlavender.com/lemon-chicken-orzo-soup/), so I’ve come up with this irresistible orzo salad with chicken and fresh vegetables and a **quick lemon honey vinaigrette** that’s simple to make.\n\nThis bright lemon orzo pasta salad is **easily customizable** and lends itself to substitutions or additions. My mantra has always been that summer recipes like salads should be fuss-free. Who wants to be in the kitchen for hours when you can be outside on the patio with a glass of prosecco?\n\nWhat you’ll need\n----------------\n\n_For the salad_\n\n*   **Orzo** – you’ll find this small rice-shaped pasta in the dry pasta aisle\n*   **Cucumbers** – I prefer using mini (Persian) cucumbers, but if you can’t find them, half a regular English one works just fine\n*   **Tomatoes** – use grape, cherry, or any little tomato variety\n*   **Onion** – red onion is the ideal kind for salads since it’s less sharp than other varieties and packs a crunch\n*   **Arugula** – for some green goodness, but it’s optional if you’d like this salad for meal prep\n*   **Chicken** – I just bought a rotisserie chicken for ease, but if you’ve got a leftover [Roast Chicken](https://www.saltandlavender.com/easy-roast-chicken/), that’s great too\n*   **Parmesan** – I can’t resist giving this pasta salad a little bit of a cheesy dimension\n*   **Basil** – fresh basil perfectly complements and enhances all the flavors\n\n_For the dressing_\n\n*   **Lemon** – we’re using both freshly squeezed lemon juice and the zest for ultimate brightness. I like to use my [Microplane](https://amzn.to/3OGHbPI) to effortlessly zest it.\n*   **Olive oil** – to balance out the acidity and add body\n*   **Honey** – for a hint of sweetness\n*   **Garlic** – use even more if you’re a big fan of garlic! I like to use [this garlic press](https://amzn.to/3I7oAJQ) to mince it since you don’t even need to peel the cloves.\n*   **Salt & pepper** – as with any pasta salad, it’s important to be generous\n\nMake ahead tip\n--------------\n\nIf you want to make this salad ahead of time or for meal prep, I suggest leaving out the arugula. That way, it’ll last in the fridge a few days no problem. Just mix in the arugula when you’re ready to enjoy it!\n\n![lemon orzo pasta salad with chicken in a glass prep bowl](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-3-720x1080.jpg)\n\nHow to make lemon orzo salad\n----------------------------\n\n_This is an overview, and full ingredients & instructions are in the recipe card below._\n\n*   Boil a salted pot of water, and cook the orzo al dente. Rinse with cool water, drain, and transfer the pasta to a large bowl.\n*   Prep and chop all the salad ingredients and add to the bowl.\n*   Add the dressing ingredients to a jar or small bowl and mix thoroughly. Toss the salad with the dressing, and enjoy!\n\nSubstitutions and variations\n----------------------------\n\n*   I used a rotisserie chicken for this recipe, but you can definitely quickly cook some chicken if you have some. Try pan frying it with your favorite seasoning, and it’ll be delicious.\n*   Need to make this vegetarian? Simply omit the chicken.\n*   Feel free to throw in any fresh herbs you may have in the garden!\n*   If you don’t like arugula, try swapping it for spinach.\n*   I think that Kalamata olives and/or capers would go great in here if you’re a fan.\n\nWhat to serve with orzo salad\n-----------------------------\n\n*   It makes a fantastic lighter main course, so it’s perfect on its own or with a slice of crusty bread.\n*   You can also leave out the chicken, and then it makes a perfect complement for seafood recipes such as my [Easy Pan Seared Salmon Recipe](https://www.saltandlavender.com/pan-seared-salmon/) or these [Tequila Lime Shrimp](https://www.saltandlavender.com/tequila-lime-shrimp/).\n\nLeftovers and storage\n---------------------\n\n*   As mentioned above, this orzo salad will keep in the fridge in an airtight container for 3-4 days no problem if you leave out the arugula.\n*   If this salad has been sitting out in the sun for any amount of time, I’d eat it right away or discard it for food safety reasons.\n\n![lemon orzo salad close-up](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-2-720x1080.jpg)\n\nAre you an orzo fan? Leave me a comment below if you have any questions or if you’ve made this orzo salad. As always, tag me #saltandlavender on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/saltandlavender) if you’ve made one of my recipes. 🙂\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup uncooked orzo\n*   ▢ 2 mini cucumbers (or 1/2 English cucumber) chopped\n*   ▢ 1 cup little tomatoes (grape/cherry/etc.) cut into quarters\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons red onion chopped\n*   ▢ 2 cups (loosely packed) fresh arugula optional\n*   ▢ 2 cups cooked/rotisserie chicken\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons fresh basil sliced thin\n\n#### Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ 1.5 tablespoons lemon juice + zest of 1 lemon\n*   ▢ 2.5 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon honey\n*   ▢ 1 clove garlic minced\n*   ▢ Salt & pepper to taste\n\n*   Boil a salted pot of water and cook the orzo al dente according to package directions. Once it's done, rinse it with cool water and let it drain thoroughly. Transfer to a large bowl.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, prep all the salad ingredients and add them to the bowl. If you're not going to eat the salad right away, I suggest skipping the arugula.\n    \n*   Add the dressing ingredients to a jar or small bowl, and whisk/shake until well combined.\n    \n*   Toss the salad with the dressing. Add more lemon/oil if needed. I also add plenty of salt & pepper – there's a lot of pasta in here, so you need to salt it well so it doesn't taste bland.\n    \n\n*   This recipe makes quite a lot of pasta salad. If served with nothing else, this could serve 4 adults. You can easily get 6+ servings out of this. If you know you’re going to have leftovers, I suggest either leaving out the arugula or only tossing it with the portion of the salad you’ll be eating right away. Without arugula, this salad will last in the fridge for a few days no problem.\n*   _Nutritional information is provided as a courtesy only and should be construed as an estimate rather than a guarantee.

In this grilled peach salad, the combination of warm peaches with crisp mixed greens and fresh berries is beyond delicious!\n\nGrilled peach salad is perhaps my favorite summer salad, and it’s **really easy to make**! The only “cooking” part involved is grilling the peaches, which takes just 8 minutes or less. In total, it takes about 20 minutes to make, so it’s a quick recipe.\n\nEvery ingredient adds so much **texture, flavor, and balance**. I love adding blackberries, blueberries, feta cheese, candied pecans to it.

It’s very easy and straightforward, and I also share tips and tricks on how to prevent them sticking to the grill.\n\n1.  **Preheat grill to medium-high heat:** Preheating is VERY important. If the grill grates are hot, the peaches will start developing grill marks immediately, which minimizes sticking. Oil the grates.\n2.  **Cut the peaches**, either into quarters or halves (remove the pit). **Brush** the flat side of the peaches, as well as the grill grates, with olive oil.\n3.  **Grill** cut-side down for 2 to 3 minutes UNDISTURBED per side. Removing them from the grill too early will cause them to stick.\n\n**How to Prevent Peaches from Sticking to Grill**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Find peaches that are ripe but also firm.** They need to be firm so they don’t get mushy, but also ripe for sweetness.\n*   **Size matters.** Bigger pieces of fruit work better. I’d recommend peach halves or quarters.\n*   Make sure the grill grates are **clean**.\n*   **Use medium-high heat.** This minimizes sticking to the grill. Brush the grill grates and peaches with **olive oil**.\n*   **Let them grill undisturbed** to get more defined grill marks. Check after 2-3 minutes and flip when ready.\n*   **Use a thin spatula:** It’s best to use a thin spatula to lift the peaches from underneath. Using tongs to flip peaches on the grill can sometimes rip the grill marks apart.\n*   **Outdoor grill, stovetop grill pan, or indoor electric grill:** I prefer cast iron, but if you’re worried about the fruit sticking to the grill, you can use a nonstick.\n\n![grilled peaches on mixed greens, berries, feta, and candied pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad2-min.jpg)\n\n**Ingredient Notes**\n--------------------\n\nGrilled peach salad is made with lots of great seasonal summer ingredients! Below I share a few ingredient notes from recipe testing. As always, the full ingredient quantity list can be found in the recipe card down below.\n\n**For the salad:**\n\n*   **Fresh peaches:** They should be ripe but firm. They need to be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but also relatively firm so that they don’t fall apart on the grill. The larger the peaches, the better.\n*   **Olive oil:** Brushing the peaches with olive oil helps prevent sticking.\n*   **Berries:** Use any fresh berries of your choice. Blackberries are my favorite for this recipe.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Choose a variety of mixed greens such as baby spinach, arugula, and romaine lettuce for texture.\n*   **Feta crumbles:** Adds fresh savory flavors. Other great choices are goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, and burrata cheese.\n\n**For the balsamic dressing:**\n\n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** For acidity and flavor.\n*   **Olive oil:** Use good extra virgin olive oil for better taste.\n*   **Minced garlic:** For flavor.\n*   **Honey:** To add sweetness and balance out the acidity.\n*   **Dijon mustard:** To help the vinegar and oil emulsify.\n*   **Salt and pepper** to taste\n\n![ingredients including water, salt, brown sugar, pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-balsamic-dressing-labeled.jpg)\n\n**For the Candied pecans:**\n\n**Brown sugar:** For sweetness. I use light brown sugar.  \n**Water:** To help the brown sugar melt and to thin it out.  \n**Pecan halves:** You can also use walnuts, if you prefer.  \n**A pinch of salt:** helps balance out the sweetness.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions**\n-----------------------------\n\nThis grilled peach salad takes about 20 minutes to make. Here’s a tutorial so you can see how easy it is!\n\n### **Step 1 | Make the candied pecans**\n\nIn a small skillet, melt the brown sugar with the water over medium-low heat. Add the pecan halves plus a pinch of salt. Stir to coat for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Want to spice them up? Add a little bit of ground cinnamon or cayenne pepper.\n\n![candied pecans in a small non-stick skillet](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/candied-pecans-for-salad-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 2 | Make the balsamic dressing**\n\nIn a mason jar, combine all the balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar and shake vigorously until emulsified or evenly combined.\n\n![prepared balsamic dressing in a mason jar](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/homemade-balsamic-peach-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 3 | Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n[Cut the peaches](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/) into thick wedges or halves, making sure they are about the same size (remove the pit).\n\nGet your grill preheated to medium-high. Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Brush the peaches with olive oil to prevent them from sticking. Grill the peaches on each flat side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed, or until they develop grill marks. Using a thin spatula, flip and grill the other side for another 2-3 minutes.\n\n### **Step 4 | Assemble the peach salad**\n\nArrange a bed of mixed greens on a large platter. Top with the berries, the prepared candied pecans, crumbled feta, and grilled peaches. Drizzle the assembled grilled peach salad with the prepared balsamic dressing…and ENJOY!\n\n**Prep Ahead Tips**\n-------------------\n\nI wouldn’t recommend making the entire peach salad in advance, but you can certainly prep a few components ahead. If you do this, you can make the entire salad in less than 20 minutes!\n\n*   **Make the candied pecans the day before** and let them cool on the counter overnight. Keep them in a container or in a covered bowl.\n*   **Make the balsamic dressing** up to 2 days in advance and refrigerate. Before using, let it sit at room temp and shake it vigorously again before using.\n*   **Note:** I wouldn’t recommend cutting the peaches until ready to grill. They will release lots of juices, and turn soft and brown overnight.\n\n**Substitutions and Variations**\n--------------------------------\n\nHere are my favorite substitutions for my grilled peach salad:\n\n*   **Greens:** I use a simple blend of mixed greens. You can also use baby spinach, arugula, or your favorite lettuce. For some crunch, use romaine or little gem lettuce.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts work great too! Also try toasted pine nuts, pistachios, or almonds.\n*   **Peaches:** If you can’t find peaches, nectarines are a great substitute.\n*   **Berries:** Mix and match! Try blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Cheese**: Try goat cheese, gorgonzola, blue cheese, mozzarella, or burrata.\n*   **Dressing:** For a creamier texture, try my [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://cookingformysoul.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/). Other great dressings are raspberry vinaigrette and basil vinaigrette.\n*   **Other favorite add-ins:** Avocado, fresh grilled corn, prosciutto, pickled red onions.\n\n![grilled peaches with berries, mixed greens, pecans, and feta](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad4-min.jpg)\n\n**Pairings and Serving Ideas**\n------------------------------\n\nServe this grilled peach salad with [grilled chicken breast](https://cookingformysoul.com/easy-lemon-chicken-marinade/) to make it a whole meal! You can also [cook chicken breast on the stovetop](https://cookingformysoul.com/moist-juicy-seared-chicken-breasts/).\n\nGreat main dish recipes that would pair great with it:\n\n*   [Hawaiian Huli Huli Chicken](https://cookingformysoul.com/huli-huli-chicken/)\n*   [Spatchcock BBQ Chicken](https://cookingformysoul.com/spatchcock-bbq-chicken/) (Grilled or Roasted)\n*   [Marinated Beef Kabobs](https://cookingformysoul.com/marinated-steak-kabobs/)\n*   [Salmon Burgers with Garlic Herb Sauce](https://cookingformysoul.com/salmon-burgers/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken Kabobs](https://cookingformysoul.com/greek-chicken-kabobs/)\n\n**Other summer-inspired recipes you must try!**\n\n*   [\n    \n    Watermelon Feta Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/watermelon-feta-salad-blueberries/)\n*   [\n    \n    Tomato Basil Pasta\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/tomato-basil-pasta/)\n*   [\n    \n    Strawberry Chicken Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/strawberry-and-spinach-salad-with-herbed-chicken/)\n*   [\n    \n    Salmon Cobb Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/salmon-cobb-salad/)\n\n**Recipe FAQs**\n---------------\n\n**Should the peaches be ripe?**\n\nYes, they should be ripe for sweetness, but also relatively firm so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n\n**Can I use canned or frozen peaches?**\n\nPreferably not.\n\n**Can I use nectarines or apricots?**\n\nYou can use nectarines as a substitute for sure. Apricots may be a bit too small to grill properly, but you can.\n\n**Do you peel the peaches?**\n\nI personally prefer to keep the skin on, but you can peel them off if desired.

Made with ripe and sweet peaches, plump berries, crisp greens, feta, and homemade candied pecans. It's drizzled with an easy honey balsamic dressing.\n\nCourse Salad\n\nCuisine American\n\nPrep Time 12 minutes\n\nCook Time 8 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings 6 people\n\nCalories 356kcal\n\n*   ▢\n*   ▢\n*   ▢\n\n#### For the salad\n\n*   ▢ 6 fresh peaches, ripe but firm\n*   ▢ Olive oil - for brushing the peaches\n*   ▢ ½ cup fresh blueberries\n*   ▢ ½ cup fresh blackberries\n*   ▢ 5 ounces mixed greens\n*   ▢ ½ cup feta cheese crumbles\n\n#### Simple candied pecans\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup light brown sugar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon water, plus more as needed\n*   ▢ 1 cup pecan halves\n*   ▢ A pinch of salt\n\n#### Honey balsamic dressing\n\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 clove garlic, finely minced\n*   ▢ 1 to 2 tablespoons honey - or to taste\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon dijon mustard\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### **Make the candied pecans**\n\n*   Heat a small skillet over medium-low heat, and melt brown sugar with the water. Add the pecans plus a pinch of salt to the skillet. Stir to coat the pecans in melted sugar for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool.\n    \n\n#### **Make the honey balsamic dressing**\n\n*   In a mason jar, combine all the honey balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar with the lid and shake vigorously until evenly combined (emulsified). Set aside.\n    \n\n#### **Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n*   [**Cut the peaches**](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/)**:** Insert a sharp knife along the natural line coming from the stem of the peach until you hit the pit in the center, and cut in half in this direction by rotating it around the knife. Separate each half and remove the pit. Then, cut each half into 2 or 3 thick wedges.\n    \n*   **Grill the peaches:** Preheat grill to medium-high heat (it needs to be hot to minimize sticking) and oil the grates. Brush the sliced peaches on both sides with some olive oil. Grill each side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed to allow grill marks to develop. Once ready, transfer to a plate. _**Tip:**_ _To flip the peaches, use a thin spatula and lift the peach from underneath to preserve the grill marks. Try not to use tongs._\n    \n\n#### **Assemble the salad**\n\n*   On a large platter, arrange a bed of mixed greens and top with the blackberries, blueberries, grilled peaches, candied pecans, and crumbled feta. Drizzle with the prepared honey balsamic vinegar to taste. Enjoy!\n    \n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:**  \n    1) Make sure the grill is preheated  \n    2) Brush the peaches and grill grates with olive oil  \n    3) Let them cook undisturbed until they get grill marks  \n    4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath. This will help maintain the grill marks on the peaches.\n*   **Prep ahead:** The dressing can be made up to 2 or 3 days in advance. The candied pecans can also be made up to 2 days ahead.  \n    Store leftovers in a container in the fridge for up to 3 days.\n\n**Substitutions:**\n\n*   **Peaches**: nectarines.\n*   **Berries:** Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Romaine, arugula, or a mix of various greens.\n\n_Nutritional values per serving are estimates only._\n\nCalories: 356kcal | Carbohydrates: 30g | Protein: 6g | Fat: 26g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 7mg | Sodium: 237mg | Potassium: 282mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 24g | Vitamin A: 636IU | Vitamin C: 14mg | Calcium: 34mg | Iron: 1mg"

These black beans give you a little change up and introduce a little sweet and spice thanks to the ginger.\n*   The dressing that goes along with it helps add to the simple flavors of the sautéed black beans and shallots.\n*   This bowl also happens to be **vegan, gluten-free and nut free!** It’s also pretty easy to customize to preference.\n*   **Takes less than 30 minutes to make** and is **super easy to through together** for a quick meal.\n\n**Key Ingredients**\n-------------------\n\n*   **Ginger:** We use both fresh and dried for this recipe\n*   **Garlic:** Also, both fresh and dried\n*   **Black Beans:** Canned to make this come together quickly\n*   **Soy Sauce:** For some simple umami flavors\n*   **Lime:** A bright burst of citrus flavor to complement the ginger and sriracha\n*   **Tahini:** For the creamy factor of the dressing\n*   **Sriracha:** Get a little nice spicy element to the dish\n\n**How to make this nourish bowl**\n---------------------------------\n\nStart by prepping your beans. Rinse and drain your beans really well and set aside. In a pan, start by sautéing your shallots with a little oil until mostly softened. Then add in your garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant.\n\n*   ![Pan with sauced shallots and black beans.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_1.jpg)\n    \n*   ![black beans being stirred together with spinach.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_2.jpg)\n    \n\nThrow in your beans and continue to sauté to help incorporate more of the garlic and ginger flavors with the beans. Add in spinach and a little soy sauce and allow spinach to wilt.\n\n*   ![Ginger sriracha sauce being mixed together in a jar.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_3.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Bowl of ginger black beans with rice and sliced cucumber topped with ginger sriracha sauce and cilantro.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_4.jpg)\n    \n\nPrepare the sauce by mixing all of the dressing ingredients together. Adjust consistency by adding small amounts of water at a time until desired consistency is achieved.\n\n**Tips for making the perfect bowl**\n------------------------------------\n\n*   Canned beans make this dish come together really fast. It’s important to make sure you rinse your beans really well to remove the sauce that coats them. Not only will it make it easier to sauté the beans with your shallots and ginger, but it will also remove excess starches that are responsible for excess gas in your guts.\n*   Make sure you use a good quality tahini for your dressing. Good quality tahini should not taste bitter. It should be mild and smooth, so that it has an easier time highlighting the main flavors without taking away from them. My preferred brand is by Soom Foods.\n\n**How long will the dressing keep for?**\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe dressing can be stored in an airtight container or jar for up to 4 days. Before using after refrigeration, give it a good stir and adjust consistency with additional water if needed. Make sure to use very little additional water as the dressing will loosen up a little bit more as it comes to room temperature.\n\n**What to pair with your beans in your nourish bowl**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe beans and sauce go really well with rice or quinoa. You can also add in some baked tofu for more protein if desired. Cooling vegetables like cucumber go really well with this bowl as well. Top with some fresh herbs like cilantro and some avocado on the side make for an extra enjoyable bowl.\n\n**More Nourish Bowls to Try**\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Almond Miso Chickpea Nourish Bowl](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/02/almond-miso-chickpea-nourish-bowl/)\n*   [Edamame Crunch Salad](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/03/edamame-crunch-salad-with-sesame-cashew-lime-dressing/)\n*   [Tahini Ranch Tofu Sheet Pan](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/01/tahini-ranch-tofu-sheet-pan/)\n\n![Side of the black bean nourish bowl with a spoon tucked into it.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_5.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/04/black-bean-nourish-bowl/print/4059/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\nThis Black Bean Nourish Bowl gives you a new and fun way to flavor your black beans by using a creamy ginger and sriracha infused dressing.

Capri is an island in Italy and this salad is called ‘Insalata Caprese’ which translates to the salad of Capri.\n\n**Can I omit the balsamic?**\n\nIf you would like to. You can opt to season with only salt, pepper and olive oil. I find this works best when tomatoes are at their peak during the summertime. The balsamic adds additional flavor during months where tomatoes are not in season.\n\n**What kind of tomatoes are best for Caprese?**\n\nFor this chopped Caprese salad, I prefer halved cherry tomatoes although grape tomatoes work as well. If you are layering slices of the salad, heirloom tomatoes are popular.\n\n**Can I substitute the fresh mozzarella cheese?**\n\nFresh mozzarella is a key ingredient in this salad. You could try fresh burrata cheese but I would not use low moisture or part-skim mozzarella as it will change the texture of the salad and add additional salt.\n\n![Tomato basil mozzarella salad in white bowl.](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Caprese-salad-2.jpg \"This easy Caprese salad is filled with ripe tomatoes, mozzarella balls, fresh basil and then topped with a homemade balsamic glaze for the most delicious combination.

Seriously, I barely go a meal without some kind of dairy product.\n\nIf you like [cheese](https://lilluna.com/tag/cheese/) as much as I do then you’ll love these Spinach Ricotta Stuffed Peppers! The peppers are jam packed with sautéed onion, garlic, and spinach, plus ricotta and parmesan cheese! I can assure you each bite is so full of flavor.\n\nThis recipe calls for 2 bell peppers cut in half, which serves 4 people. But if you’re feeding a larger crowd, or you can eat more than one half pepper, you can easily double the recipe! In that case, the Costco size pack of bell peppers might come in handy. 😉\n\nThese stuffed peppers are so flavorful and cheesy and way too easy to throw together. I have a feeling I’m going to be making these a lot more this spring and summer.\n\n![Easy Stuffed Bell Peppers and grape tomatoes in a white baking dish](https://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-peppers-resize-5.jpg \"Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness. They are perfect for meatless Monday or dinner with vegetarian friends!\")\n\nHow to Make Stuffed Bell Peppers\n--------------------------------\n\nThis recipe is SO easy… And the peppers themselves only require a handful of ingredients!\n\n**FILLING.** Cook up some onions and garlic, wilt the spinach, season, and then mix it with the ricotta and Parmesan cheese.\n\n**STUFF.** Take the mixture and stuff it into each pepper half.\n\n**BAKE.** Toss the tomatoes into the 9×13 pan. Drizzle with a little olive oil and then salt and pepper. Arrange the stuffed peppers in the pan with the tomatoes and then bake at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes.\n\n**GARNISH.** Top with more parmesan, fresh basil or parsley.\n\nMeanwhile, make your grain. What’s your go-to grain? Quinoa, rice, orzo? I really enjoyed these peppers with [Orzo Rice](https://www.garnishandglaze.com/orzo-rice/). You just toast the orzo in butter until golden and then add some rice and proceed as you would normally cook rice. So good!\n\nTips + SToring INfo\n-------------------\n\n**Add protein** by incorporating roasted chickpeas, beans, or crumbled sausage/hamburger\n\n**To make it spicy**, add crushed red pepper flakes or a splash of hot sauce\n\n**STORE** stuffed peppers in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. The peppers will get softer as time progresses. \n\n**To make ahead,** assemble the stuffed peppers ahead of time and keep them covered in the fridge for 24 hours before baking. Bake like normal.\n\n**REHEAT** the stuffed peppers either in the microwave or in the oven. To reheat them in the oven you will want to cover them and bake them at 350 or 15-20 minutes until they’re warmed through. If you are using the microwave, heat them on high for 2 minutes.\n\n![Stuffed Peppers with Rice on a white plate](https://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-peppers-9.jpg \"Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness.

My personal favorite is Yukon gold mashed potatoes because they are rich, flavorful, and super creamy when mashed. Russet potatoes will be lighter and fluffier. Or, get the best of both worlds and use half Yukon gold and half Russet potatoes. You can also use red potatoes, but the mashed potatoes will be heavier and less creamy and fluffy.\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n![recipe ingredients: chopped yukon gold potatoes, butter, milk and salt in bowls](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mashed-potatoes-ingredients-488.jpg?resize=1800%2C1200&ssl=1 \"Mashed potatoes ingredients. The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\n*   **Potatoes:** Yukon golds or Russets.\n*   **Butter:** You want the butter to be softened but not melted. Room temperature butter will melt into the potatoes easily.\n*   **Salt and Pepper:** You’ll add some salt to the cooking water and then more salt, to taste, after cooking. \n*   **Milk:** Whole milk makes the best rich and creamy mashed potatoes, but you can use skim milk if that’s what you have on hand. Warm the milk before stirring it into the potatoes. This keeps the potatoes from cooling off too much and helps to make creamy potatoes.\n\nHow to Make Mashed Potatoes\n---------------------------\n\n_Here’s an overview of the recipe steps. Find the full recipe with ingredient amounts and instructions in the recipe card below._\n\nScrub the potatoes. Whether or not to peel the potatoes is up to you. I usually peel Russet potatoes but not Yukon golds. Yukon gold potatoes have thin skins and the skins add nice texture.\n\nCut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Try to make the pieces about the same size so that they will cook evenly. Put the potatoes in a pot of cold water and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat.\n\nHow Long to Boil Potatoes for Mashed Potatoes\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBoil potatoes for 12-15 minutes, until they are very tender when pierced with a fork. To avoid lumpy potatoes, be sure to cook them until very tender. However, you don’t want to cook the potatoes so much that they are falling apart.\n\nPour the potatoes into a colander and drain them well. Then put the potatoes back into the hot pot for 2-3 minutes to allow extra moisture to evaporate.  This step gives you fluffier, creamier mashed potatoes.\n\n![side by side photos: potatoes and butter in pot and mashed potatoes, milk, salt and pepper in pot](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes.jpg?resize=1205%2C900&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\nAdd the butter and use a potato masher to mash the potatoes. The butter will melt into the potatoes as you mash them. Stir in the warm milk. Potatoes can vary in how thirsty they are, so add milk until the mashed potatoes reach your desired creaminess. Season to taste with salt and pepper, serve and enjoy!\n\nRecipe Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Start the potatoes in cold water and then bring it to a boil. Using a cold start promotes even cooking, so the outsides of the potatoes won’t overcook by the time the insides are done. Even cooking is also why you want to cut potatoes before boiling, instead of boiling them whole. \n*   Adding salt to the cooking water flavors the potatoes from the beginning. It really does make a difference!\n*   To avoid lumps, cook the potatoes until they are very soft and tender when pierced with a fork or knife. Lumpy mashed potatoes are usually caused by mashing undercooked potatoes.\n*   I recommend mashing your potatoes by hand for fluffy mashed potatoes. Using an electric mixer is easy, but it can result in a gummy or gluey texture because it makes it too easy to overwork the potatoes. The same goes for when you are mashing and stirring by hand – be careful to not overwork the potatoes.\n*   Be sure to use softened butter and warm milk (or cream).\n\n![serving dish with mashed potatoes topped with melted butter and chives](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mashed-potatoes-recipe-474.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\nHow to Reheat Mashed Potatoes\n-----------------------------\n\n*   Potatoes tend to dry out over time, so **add more milk** to make them creamy again.\n*   **In the microwave:** Microwave on high power, stirring occasionally, until hot. Add more milk as needed.\n*   **In the oven:** Stir a bit of milk into the potatoes and put them in a baking dish. Cover with foil and bake at 350° F until hot, stirring once or twice.\n*   **Make ahead:** You can make this recipe up to two hours ahead and then keep the potatoes warm in a slow cooker using the warm setting.\n\nRecipe Variations\n-----------------\n\n*   **Extra Rich and Creamy:** Instead of milk, use half and half or heavy cream for richer mashed potatoes.\n*   **Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes:** Substitute buttermilk for the milk. Do not warm the buttermilk or it may curdle. You’ll love the tangy buttermilk flavor!\n*   **Cream Cheese:** Add 4 ounces of cream cheese per 3 pounds of potatoes. Soften the cream cheese to room temperature and then mash it into the potatoes along with the butter.\n*   **Sour Cream:** Add 2 tablespoons of sour cream, plus more to taste if desired. Sour cream makes the potatoes extra creamy and adds a slightly tangy flavor.\n*   **Garlic Mashed Potatoes:** For easy garlic mashed potatoes, stir in garlic powder, starting with 1/4 teaspoon and then adding more to taste or try my [garlic mashed potatoes](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/garlic-mashed-potatoes/) recipe with [roasted garlic](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/roasted-garlic/). \n*   **Herb Mashed Potatoes:** Chives are a classic addition to mashed potatoes. Or, add other fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme or sage. If you want to add dried herbs, oregano, thyme and basil are good options.\n*   **Bacon:** Because everything is better with bacon! Cook chopped bacon in a skillet and then top mashed potatoes with the cooked bacon crumbles.\n*   **Loaded Mashed Potatoes:** The ultimate comfort food! Stir in sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, bacon crumbles and chopped chives or green onions. \n\n![mashed potatoes with butter and chives in a serving bowl](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-mashed-potatoes-467.jpg?resize=1800%2C1200&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe!

These meatballs are tender to the core! Nestled in a rich and creamy lemon sauce, they are perfect to serve over pasta, quinoa, or fluffy rice!\n\n![greek chicken meatballs in lemon cream sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-12-710x1065.jpg)\n\nWarm, hearty and deliciously creamy!\n\nThese tender, seared chicken meatballs are rolling around in a creamy lemon sauce that has a nice little zing! They’re warm and comforting but still offer a bright and beautiful lemony flavor that doesn’t leave you feeling heavy. Don’t be surprised if you catch the fam eating right out of the skillet while the sauce is still warm and tangy.\n\nIt’s the perfect transitional meal to take us from summer right into fall or from winter into spring. I’m not quite ready to let go of all the summer flavors, but with the gloomy weather we’ve been having lately, I’m ready for warm bowls of food again. Greek chicken meatballs totally fit the bill.\n\n![chicken meatballs in lemon sauce with cooked orzo in speckled bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**What do you need to make the Greek chicken meatballs?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Garlic + herbs:** minced garlic, chopped parsley, and dried oregano help add flavor the meatballs. You can use fresh or dried herbs for this recipe. Keep in mind you need roughly double the amount if you’re using fresh herbs.\n*   **Lemon zest:** brightens up the meatballs and adds just a fresh flavor to them\n*   **breadcrumbs:** are used for binding. I prefer to use [Panko](https://amzn.to/31UtFlz) breadcrumbs because they melt right into the meatballs and you don’t even realize they’re there.\n*   **Feta cheese:** adds tang and aids in binding the meatballs as well. Before this recipe, I had never added feta cheese to homemade meatballs, and I love the flavor they add.\n*   **An egg:** Acts as a binder to hold everything together.\n*   **Ground chicken:** I prefer to use ground chicken breasts, but I would think if you like chicken thighs, you might want to use ground thighs here. They would certainly add more flavor and retain extra moisture as well!\n\n![ingredients for the meatball ball mixture in stainless steel bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-17-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### **How to portion chicken meatballs:**\n\nOnce you’ve made the meatball mixture, divide it into 24-28 portions. I like to use a [cookie scoop](https://amzn.to/3jSfROH) so that the meatballs are all the same size. Doing this also cuts down on the guesswork for cooking the meatballs because they cook up in roughly the same amount of time when they’re the same size.\n\n### **What if the meatball mixture sticks to my hands?**\n\nIf the meatball mixture sticks to your hands when you’re rolling them, just spray the inside of your hands with a little cooking spray before grabbing the meat mixture. This should keep the mixture from sticking to your hands!\n\n![close up of cooked chicken meatball in lemon cream sauce on a spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-4-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**How to make Greek chicken meatballs:**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  In a bowl, combine everything but the meat mixture along with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. I use a fork to mix all the ingredients together.\n2.  When the ingredients are mix, add the ground chicken and mix until just combined. You don’t want to overwork the meat mixture or you’ll be left with tough and dry meatballs. Portion the meatballs using a cookie scoop into roughly 1 ½ tablespoon portions. \n3.  Add a drizzle of oil to a hot skillet and cook the meatballs for about 5-7 minutes or until they cook all the way through. You want to flip them so that they brown evenly on all sides. Be sure to not overcrowd the pan or they won’t brown!\n\n> **TIP:** At this point, you can allow the meatballs to cool and freeze them for later. If you plan on making this midweek and don’t have the time to fry the meatballs the day of, just freeze the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment. When frozen, transfer to a freezer-safe bag.\n\n![close up of prepared meatballs in lemon sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients for the lemon sauce for Greek chicken meatballs?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Butter:** Butter plays a two-part role in the sauce. We’ll use a little bit to sauté the garlic and flour in and the last tablespoon is added at the end to add creaminess and a little bit of luster to the sauce.\n*   **Garlic:** sautéed in butter it adds so much delicious flavor to the sauce\n*   **flour:** just a tablespoon is used in this recipe to help thicken the sauce\n*   **Chicken stock:** is the base of the creamy lemon sauce\n*   **Green olives:** briny green olives are the perfect pairing to the bright zingy lemon sauce. Capers would also work if you aren’t a fan of green olives\n*   **Egg yolks:** the egg yolks I know are an unusual addition to a cream sauce. They help emulsify the sauce and make it extra creamy and delicious! Trust me, I was super scared to try it too, but I have a foolproof method for you below!\n*   **Lemon juice + zest:** help flavor the sauce\n*   **Nutmeg:** Add a depth of flavor that works beautifully with all the lemony flavor in this recipe. [Freshly grated](https://amzn.to/2Ds0dtI) works best!\n\n![lemon sauce pouring from spoon oven meatballs in bowl with orzo](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-5-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**The secret to perfectly smooth lemon sauce:**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cook the flour:** Add a knob of butter to the skillet and allow the butter to melt. Saute the garlic in the butter until fragrant. Then, add the flour and whisk. You want to let the flour cook for 30 seconds to get rid of the raw flavor. Then, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Once the stock is completely incorporated, allow it to reach a simmer and then let cook for a few minutes until it thickens just a tad bit.\n2.  **Combine the yolks and lemon juice:** While the sauce is thickening, you want to add the lemon juice to a bowl along with the egg yolks and whisk them to combine. Then, once the sauce is thickened, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet to the lemon egg mixture as you whisk. **Adding the hot liquid to the eggs and lemon juice will help temper the yolks so that the sauce doesn’t break later.** You’ll repeat the same thing a total of three times or until you’ve added a total of 3 tablespoons of the liquid to the yolk mixture.\n3.  **Finish the sauce:** With the skillet on the lowest heat setting, stir the yolk mixture into the skillet. Once combined, kick the heat up to medium and continue to stir and cook the sauce for 4-6 minutes until it thickens to your liking. Keep in mind it will thicken quite a bit when it cools, so you don’t want to thicken it too much at this point if you plan on serving it later! Stir in the lemon zest and the nutmeg. Then, add the butter and green olives to the sauce and stir to combine. Place the meatballs back into the pan and allow them to just heat through. Serve warm over buttered orzo, or with fried bread on the side.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Greek Avgolemono Soup](https://littlespicejar.com/avgolemono-soup/)\n*   [Rustic Chicken Piccata Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/rustic-chicken-piccata-meatballs/)\n*   [French Onion Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/comforting-french-onion-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Cajun Chicken Meatballs in Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/cajun-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Swedish Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/swedish-meatballs/)\n*   [Firecracker Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/firecracker-chicken-meatballs/)\n\n![skillet with meatballs and sauce with wooden spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-7-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![Greek Chicken Meatballs in Lemon Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-735x1102.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Meatballs:\n\n*   5 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon zest AND chopped parsley\n*   ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs\n*   ⅓ cup grated yellow onions\n*   ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   1 large egg\n*   1 ½ teaspoon dried oregano (a little more if it’s fresh)\n*   1 ¼ pound lean ground chicken\n\n#### Lemon Olive Sauce:\n\n*   3 tablespoons salted cold butter, cubed\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n*   1 ½ cups low sodium chicken stock\n*   ½ cup green olives (or use ¼ cup capers!)\n*   2 teaspoons lemon zest + ⅓ cup lemon juice\n*   2 egg yolks\n*   ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **MEATBALLS:** In a medium bowl, using a fork, mix together all the ingredients except the ground chicken. You also want to add 1 teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper. When the ingredients are combined, add the ground chicken and mix until \\*just\\* combined. Just be sure you don’t overwork the meat. Roll into 24-28 meatballs using a cookie scoop or about 1 ½ tablespoon each.\n2.  **COOK:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle in a little oil. Add the meatballs to the skillet but do not overcrowd. Cook in batches if they don’t all fit. Sear the meatballs for 5-7 minutes, flipping to brown all sides evenly, until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. Remove the meatballs to a plate.\n3.  **SAUCE:** Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet along with the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn. Add the flour and whisk. Once the flour cooks for 30 seconds, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Then, allow the sauce to reach a simmer, and continue to cook for 3 minutes or until the sauce thickens a bit. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and let the sauce hang out. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and egg yolks. Once combined, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet into the egg mixture while you whisk it. Repeat this step two more times (so a total of 3 tablespoon of sauce should be added to the yolks.) Then, with the heat on the lowest setting, add the yolk mixture to the sauce you have on the stove. Kick the heat up to medium and stir the sauce and allow it to cook for 4-6 minutes or until it thickens to your liking. Then, stir in the nutmeg and lemon zest. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper as desired. Add the last tablespoon of butter to the sauce and allow it to melt in slowly. Add the green olives to the sauce along with the meatballs. Let them heat through for just a minute or two until warm. Serve with fried bread, over buttered orzo, or rice!\n\nThis site contains affiliate links, if you make a purchase through them, we receive a small commission.\n\n_originally published on_ Sep 3, 2020 _(last updated_ Jul 9, 2022_)_\n\n[54 comments](https://littlespicejar.com/greek-chicken-meatballs-in-lemon-cream-sauce/#comments) [Leave a comment »](#respond)"

Even though I have the best and most mellow baby, it seems impossible to get anything done.\n\nIt is partly my fault because I snuggle her all day long. But the truth is I am tired and the last thing I want to do is make an elaborate meal for the family.\n\nBut the best part about it is that you can make an easy 30 minute meal but still have it be incredible! And you can never go wrong with the butter garlic and herb combination. Am I right?\n\nI L-O-V-E using fresh herbs when I cook. And thyme is always the star of the dish and one of my favorite herbs to use.\n\nThe smell of fresh herbs cooking in a buttery garlic sauce is incredible. The chicken was perfectly tender and juicy and then you have the zucchini.\n\nZucchini is my summer jam so brace yourself for a lot of it as well. It is so so good sautéed in the buttery garlic herb sauce and they are perfectly tender. It was the perfect pairing with the chicken and makes for a complete low carb meal! You are going to love it.\n\nWhat do you need to make buttery garlic herb chicken with zucchini?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Butter\n*   Garlic cloves\n*   Freshly chopped oregano\n*   Fresh rosemary\n*   Fresh thyme\n*   Boneless skinless chicken thighs\n*   Salt and pepper\n*   Medium sized zucchini\n\nHow do you make buttery garlic herb chicken with zucchini?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   In a medium size skillet over medium high heat add the butter until melted. Add the garlic, oregano, rosemary and thyme. Add the chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until chicken is no longer pink and 165 degrees. Remove chicken and set aside on plate.\n*   Add the zucchini to the pan and salt and pepper. Sauté for 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add chicken back to the pan for a minute or so and serve.\n\nWhat temperature should juicy chicken be cooked to?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe safe internal temperature for cooked chicken is 165° Fahrenheit (75° Celsius). A meat or instant-read thermometer is your best bet for determining the temperature of your chicken. It should be inserted into the thickest part of the thigh but not touching bone.\n\nCan you use chicken breast instead of chicken thighs?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, absolutely! You will took it all the same but adding a few more minutes still leaving the chicken at a internal thermal setting of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n![Buttery Garlic Herb Chicken with Zucchini 2](https://therecipecritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/0C4A9277.jpg \"Buttery Garlic Herb Chicken with Zucchini is an easy 30 minute meal that has tender and juicy chicken cooked in a buttery garlic herb sauce with zucchini.  This dish is cooked with fresh herbs and is incredible! \")\n\nWhat is zucchini?\n-----------------\n\nThe zucchini or courgette is a summer squash. A zucchini is a thin-skinned cultivar of what in Britain and Ireland is referred to as a marrow.\n\nHow do you know what is a good zucchini?\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe vegetable should feel firm yet tender with shiny or glossy skin. When you cut into a good zucchini, it should have an almost buttery-like texture and the flesh should appear slightly yellow, greenish or white.\n\nHow do you cut zucchini?\n------------------------\n\n*   Wash and dry the zucchini.\n*   Using a sharp knife, slice off ends of the zucchini.\n*   Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise.\n*   Slice into 1 cm slices.\n\nCan you use dried herbs?\n------------------------\n\nYes! Sometimes it is hard to have fresh herbs on hand. Dried herbs have a stronger flavoring.

The ground pork has a higher fat content than the ground beef which keeps these meatballs perfectly juicy and flavorful.\n\n**Step One:** The first step to making these meatballs is to chop the herbs, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. For ultimate flavor this recipe uses a combination of fresh mint, dill, and parsley as well as red onion and garlic.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8c4b5e6.jpg)\n\n**Step Two:** Once you have chopped everything, now it’s time to make the meatballs. Add the ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, and herbs to a mixing bowl. This is also when you’ll add the dried herbs, spices, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything until well combined.\n\n**Step Three:** When the meat, herbs, and spices are well combined use a cookie dough scoop to form the meatballs and then roll them in between the palm of your hands. Place them on a sheet pan that has been drizzled with olive oil.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8d074cf.jpg)\n\n**Step Four:** After all of the meatballs have been rolled and placed on the sheet pan, bake them at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes until they have cooked all the way through.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8e065f6.jpg)\n\nCool and Creamy Tzatziki Sauce\n------------------------------\n\nThe meatballs are definitely the star of this recipe but the cool and creamy tzatziki sauce deserves an award, too. If you have never had tzatziki before I am incredibly excited for you to try this recipe because, honestly, it just might change your life. I know that’s a bold claim but trust me.\n\nTzatziki is a thick sauce made from a combination of Greek yogurt, cucumber, dill, garlic, salt, and lemon juice. Tzatziki sauce is great with these meatballs but it is also perfect as a dip for fresh veggies, pita bread, or crackers.\n\nIf you have had tzatziki before but you’ve been intimidated by the idea of making it at home yourself, this is your lucky day. Homemade tzatziki is so easy to make and, personally, one of my favorite condiments to make at home.\n\nHaving a food processor or high-powered blender makes whipping up a batch of tzatziki even easier because you can quickly chop the garlic, dill, and cucumber. Once that step is done, all you have to do is add the cumber, garlic, dill, Greek yogurt, salt, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Stir everything until well combined and store in the fridge!\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8eb6aee.jpg)\n\nHow to Serve the Meatballs\n--------------------------\n\nThere are few different ways you can serve these meatballs and they are all absolutely delicious. I encourage you to get creative but, of course, I’ll share some of my favorite ways to eat these yummy meatballs!\n\n*   **Serve them an appetizer or party snack!** These Greek meatballs are perfect to serve at a dinner party or as a fun appetizer. You can make a double batch of the meatball, put a cocktail stick in each one, and then serve the tzatziki on the side as a dipping sauce.\n    \n\n*   **Make a delicious Greek salad bowl!** This is one of my favorite ways to serve these meatballs. Place them over a bed of fresh romaine or your favorite mixed greens and serve with tomatoes, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, dill, peppers, and whatever other veggies sound good. You can also add rice or [Greek chickpea salad](https://www.allthehealthythings.com/recipeindex/greek-chickpea-salad) to your bowl if you would like. Finish off your bowl with a generous drizzle of tzatziki.\n    \n\n*   **Stuff them in a pita!** If a Greek pita sandwich is more your thing, feel free to stuff these meatballs in a pita with chopped lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, and of course, plenty of tzatziki sauce.\n    \n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8f8e159.jpg)\n\nIf You Love This Greek Meatball Recipe, Here a Few More Delicious Recipes You Should Try\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Greek Chicken Meatballs\n*   One Pan Greek Chicken with Artichokes\n*   Greek Pasta Salad\n*   Greek Salmon Salad\n*   Greek Broccoli Pasta Salad\n\nI hope you give these **Greek Meatballs** a try!

Here are a few tips to make your **roasted veggies** even better!\n\n*   Cut each separate vegetable about the same size as each other so they all roast evenly.\n*   Feel free to experiment with different herbs: sage, in particular, would go really well here, too!\n*   Use tri-colored carrots if you can find some, they will add a splash of color to the **roasted vegetables**.\n*   Add other root vegetables like parsnips, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, or beets to the mix.\n\n### Should we peel the vegetables before roasting?\n\nAs long as you wash carrots, potatoes, and zucchini well, you do not need to peel them before roasting. In fact, unpeeled vegetables are delicious because the outer layer browns when baked and gives a deeper flavor.\n\n**What kind of herbs are best to roast potatoes and others veggies?**\n\nWe used thyme and rosemary in this **roasted zucchini, carrot, and potatoes recipe** because we love the flavor combination, but oregano, tarragon, or fresh basil would also be delicious.\n\n### How to serve roasted potatoes, carrots, and zucchini?\n\nThis recipe pairs supremely with any weeknight meal. You can serve the roasted veggies with chicken, turkey, fish, or steak! That said, our **garlic herb roasted potatoes carrots and zucchini recipe** is a solid holiday side, and will make a remarked appearance on your table for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or any other special occasion!\n\n### How to reheat the roasted vegetables for meal prep?\n\nYou can just pop the Garlic Herb Roasted Potatoes Carrots and Zucchini in the microwave and you’re done!\n\n### How and how long to keep the roasted potato and veggies leftovers?\n\nJust pop the roasted potatoes and zucchini in an airtight container and store them in your refrigerator for up to 3 days.

    "markdown": "# Spicy Honey-Lime Chicken - Two Kooks In The Kitchen\nThe combination of honey (or maple syrup), soy sauce, sriracha, zesty lime, garlic and ginger in this spicy honey lime chicken recipe is wicked. Delicious hot, room temp or cold.\n\nYou can make the recipe with whole boneless chicken thighs or chicken breasts on skewers or with bone-in chicken.\n\n![3 chicken thigh skewers on cutting board](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0023.jpg)\n\nMy favorite is boneless skinless chicken thighs (pictured here) because they are so flavorful, they absorb the marinade well and they tend to stay moister than breasts. If you’ve read any of our other chicken posts, you’ve heard this. Many times.\n\nThe spicy honey lime chicken marinade with its tart citrus tang – so delicious, so much flavor – also works well with pork skewers, tenderloin or chops. Even tofu. It’s one of my favorite chicken thigh recipes.\n\nBest side dish for this chicken dinner\n--------------------------------------\n\nThat’s hard. So many things go well with honey-lime chicken thighs. Here are some great ideas for a side and side salad: [citrus salad](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/citrus-salad/), [easy potato knishes](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/super-easy-potato-knishes/), [bread salad with charred snap peas](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/bread-salad-with-charred-snap-peas/), [grilled corn salad](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-corn-salad/), [party salad with grilled vegetables and quinoa,](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/party-salad-grilled-vegetables-quinoa/) [roasted baby cauliflower](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/roasted-baby-cauliflower/) and [grilled vegetable orzo salad recipe](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-vegetable-orzo/).\n\nTailor To Your Taste\n--------------------\n\n### **How to serve honey lime chicken**\n\n*   I love the grilled chicken skewers format the best because you get the maximum glaze covering the chicken. But you can also use whole chicken breasts or thighs. If using bone-in, I suggest doubling the marinade.\n*   For appetizers, use regular boneless chicken thighs or breasts. Once cooked, cut the chicken into small pieces and thread on small wooden skewers or toothpicks to serve.\n*   The chicken is fabulous served in pita or tortillas with a tangy coleslaw or Israeli salad.\n\n### **Options for honey lime chicken marinade**\n\n*   Vary the amount of sriracha heat you like. The amount in the recipe is fairly spicy. I know some will like it even hotter. Or some not at all. If you don’t have sriracha, try chili powder or red pepper flakes.\n*   Replace the lime with lemon in the honey lime mixture (marinade).\n*   Try adding coriander or a favorite spice to the marinade.\n\n### **Cooking method alternatives**\n\n*   If you don’t have a grill, broil the chicken skewers in the oven for 9-12 minutes.\n*   Cooking time will take longer with bone in chicken. Heat one side of the grill on low, the other on medium high. Cook until almost done ((140F) on the low side, then switch to the hotter side to brown and finish cooking.\n\nShortcuts\n---------\n\n*   Skip the skewers and cook boneless or bone-in chicken (not cut up). Still delish! And **dinner in 20 minutes**.\n*   Substitute 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder for the fresh garlic.\n*   Marinate at room temperature for 30-40 minutes instead of 4-6 hours or overnight in the fridge. Or skip the marinating altogether. The flavors won’t be as intense, but still great. Consider doubling the sauce or making 1 1/2 times the amount if you are not marinating the chicken.\n\nHow to make spicy honey-lime chicken\n------------------------------------\n\n![cut up boneless chicken thighs, salt, sriracha, ginger, soy, maple syrup, garlic, lime juice, lime](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9970.jpg)\n\nIngredients: Cut up boneless chicken thighs, salt, sriracha, ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, lime juice, lime\n\n![boneless chicken thighs marinating in ziploc bag](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9978.jpg)\n\nMake the marinade and use half of it to marinate the chicken. Reserve the rest for basting.\n\n![3 raw chicken skewers](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9979.jpg)\n\nSkewer the chicken.\n\n![3 chicken skewers on the grill, partly cooked](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0021.jpg)\n\nGrill chicken on medium high heat and baste with remaining marinade.\n\n![3 honey lime chicken skewers on cutting board p](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0023.jpg)\n\nMake Ahead\n----------\n\n*   Make the recipe ahead for a crowd and serve it at room temperature. Or warm it briefly in the microwave for a minute or two. Don’t overdo it or the chicken will dry out and toughen.\n\nOther easy grilled chicken recipes you might like\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   [Mediterranean marinated grilled chicken](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/mediterranean-style-marinated-chicken/)\n*   [chicken bulgogi recipe](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/chicken-bulgogi-recipe/) (Korean)\n*   [Grilled BBQ chicken](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-bbq-chicken/)\n*   [Grilled Vietnamese chicken](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-vietnamese-chicken/)\n*   [Sweet and spicy chicken wings](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/sweet-and-spicy-chicken-wings/)\n*   [Smoked chicken thighs (without a smoker)](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/smoked-chicken-thighs-recipe-without-a-smoker/) \n*   [Homemade peri peri chicken (grilled or baked)](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/peri-peri-chicken-recipe/)\n\nIf you like this recipe, please leave a 5 star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟with a comment in the recipe card below. Thanks so much!\n\nThe combination of honey (or maple syrup), soy sauce, sriracha, lime, garlic and ginger in this spicy honey lime chicken recipe is wicked. Delicious hot, room temp or cold.\n\nPrep Time10 minutes\n\nCook Time10 minutes\n\nMarinating time30 minutes\n\nTotal Time50 minutes\n\nCourse: Appetizer, Main Course\n\nCuisine: American\n\nServings: 5\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    Skewers (metal or wood). If using wood, soak for 30 minutes before using. Skewers not needed if using uncut boneless or bone in chicken.\n    \n\n*   ▢ 2 1/2 pounds (1.13kg) boneless skinless thighs, trimmed and cut into 2 inch/5.1cm pieces, **Note 1** **chicken tenders or boneless breasts are fine too**\n*   ▢ **Garnish**: 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro or parsley; lime wedges\n\n#### Honey Lime chicken marinade (and glaze), Note 2\n\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoon soy sauce low sodium is good if you have\n*   ▢ 6 tablespoon honey or maple syrup\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon lime zest from one lime\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoon fresh lime juice from 1 1/2 to 2 limes\n*   ▢ 4 garlic cloves, minced or grated (or 1/2 tsp garlic powder)\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (about 1 1/2 inch of fresh ginger)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tablespoon Sriracha sauce for pretty spicy (use more or less to taste)\n*   ▢ 1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch (to thicken to glaze consistency) Optional\n\n*   **MAKE MARINADE/SAUCE**: Whisk all marinade ingredients together in a small bowl. Or blend them in a food processor.\n    \n*   **MARINATE CHICKEN:** Pour **half** the marinade (about 1/2 cup) into a sealed zipper bag or container and add chicken. Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or 6-12 hours in fridge. _Tip: if marinating overnight, I leave out lime juice and increase zest so it doesn't 'cook' the chicken._\n    \n    **Glaze:** The reserved 1/2 cup marinade will be used for glazing/basting. _(_**Optional but suggested**_: Mix 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch into reserved marinade and microwave for 1 minute to make a glaze-like consistency. I do this)._ Set aside.\n    \n*   **PREPARE GRILL**: Scrape grill and spray grill with oil (or dip paper towel in oil and rub on grill). Heat grill to medium-high heat. If using wood skewers, soak them for 30 minutes beforehand to avoid burning. **Note 3**.\n    \n*   **GRILL CHICKEN SKEWERS**: Skewer marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and _pat dry (__important__)_. Discard the marinade used for marinating. Lightly spray chicken with oil to further avoid sticking. Grill on all sides until chicken cooks to a golden brown (you'll need to turn chicken a couple of times), for 9-12 minutes in total (depending on thickness and how tightly packed the skewers are), basting once or twice with the honey lime glaze. Instant thermometer will read 160F/71C. Rest chicken, loosely covered for 5 minutes.\n    \n*   **SERVE**: If you have any leftover sauce, drizzle it on the chicken or warm it in microwave for 30 seconds and pass it around. Sprinkle chicken with cilantro or parsley and serve with lime wedges if desired. Serve hot or at room temperature.\n    \n\n1.  **Chicken options:**\n    *   I prefer thighs because they are juicier and less likely to dry out when cooked. In this recipe, however, breasts work really well too when marinated.\n    *   Instead of skewered chicken, you can also cook regular bone-in or boneless chicken (but make extra marinade for bone-in)\n    *   Kosher chicken is juicier and has a little extra flavor because it is already brined. \n2.  **Marinade/glaze**: If you are using bone in chicken, I suggest doubling the marinade/glaze. In fact, you might also want to double it (or do 1 1/2 times the amounts) to use as a dipping sauce or to soak into a side of rice or quinoa. \n3.  **No grill?** Instead, chicken can be broiled in the oven, turning once, for 9-12 minutes, brushing with the glaze.\n4.  **Make Ahead:** The recipe can be made ahead for a crowd and served at room temperature or cold. Or warmed briefly in the microwave for a minute or two. Don’t overdo it or the chicken will dry out and toughen.\n\n_Nutritional information estimates include boneless chicken breasts.

It is just a wonderfully seasoned dish of roasted deliciousness. The veggies tend to break down into a stew-like consistency, but there isn’t enough “broth/gravy” to consider it a stew.\n\n![Bowl of Rustic Italian Vegetable Bake](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rustic-Italian-Vegetable-Bake_11.jpg)\n\n**Helpful Tips**\n----------------\n\nThe key thing to ensure a perfectly baked dish is to make sure all the potatoes are perfectly tender.  You need to test several of them by piercing them with a sharp knife.\n\nAdditionally, try not to mix them with a heavy hand. You don’t want the veggies to break down too much, but if they do, no worries. It still tastes AH-MAZING!!!\n\nI’ll let Mom tell you more!\n\n![Rustic Italian Vegetable Bake](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rustic-Italian-Vegetable-Bake_17.jpg)\n\n**Hi!  Robin here.**\n--------------------\n\nWhat I love about this dish is that it is super-duper easy to make.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.\n2.  Place the **Spice/Herb Ingredients** into a small bowl, mix to combine, set aside.\n3.  Place all the **Bake Ingredients** and **Spice/Herb mix** into a deep ceramic/enamel lined Dutch oven or similar roasting pan. Mix well everything to ensure all the ingredients are evenly coated.  Sprinkle the top lightly with some additional sea salt and black pepper.  Cover with a tight-fitting lid, then place in a preheated 400 F oven and roast for 40 minutes.\n4.  After 40 minutes, remove from the oven and gently mix in the cannellini beans, cover and return to the oven for another 5 to 20 minutes **or until the potatoes are perfectly tender**. The 2nd baking time is largely dependent upon the size of the potatoes. (see notes on baking time).\n5.  After 5 minutes (or 20 minutes), remove from the oven, remove the lid and allow the heat to escape for approx. 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.\n6.  Sprinkle individual portions with nutritional yeast (or [**_Vegan Parmesan Cheese_**](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/vegan-parmesan-cheese/)) and serve with some freshly chopped parsley.\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n**\\*Vegetable Stock:**   We use **_Pacific Organic Low Sodium Vegetable Stock_**. We love this brand because it is Whole Food Plant Based compliant, as it does not contain MSG, has no oil, and does not contain any highly-processed ingredients.\n\n**\\*Stock Amount:** The amount of vegetable stock is a personal preference.  This is not a stew, so there is little broth, but the veggies are coated in a nice thin-like rustic gravy.  If you want more “gravy”, use 4 tablespoons of vegetable stock.\n\n**\\*Baking Soda:**  The baking soda is often used as a neutralizer for dishes that contain a lot of acidity, typically from tomatoes.  We use it in this dish to remove some of the tomato acidity without losing the tomatoey flavor. When you add it, the mixture will bubble up, then settle down as it neutralizes the acidity.\n\n**\\*Dried Thyme Crushed Leaves:**  We use **_[Penzeys French Thyme](https://amzn.to/31Ud5iK)_**.  It has amazing flavor.  If you can’t find dried crushed thyme leaves, you can use ground thyme, but use half the amount.\n\n**\\*Zucchini Texture:**  Because the zucchini is in the oven for a long period of time, it will be mushy. This is a rustic bake, so this is expected. However, we know there may be folks who prefer a firmer texture. Please feel free to add the zucchini later in the oven baking process if you do not enjoy mushy zucchini.\n\n**\\*Potato Wedges:**  Potato wedges take longer to cook than cubed potatoes.  If you are looking to shorten the oven time, then cube the potatoes.  When checking for tenderness of the potatoes, be sure to check multiple potatoes as the ones that are on the bottom tend to cook faster than the ones on top.  Avoid constantly stirring the mixture as this will cause the vegetables to break down.  Gently stir, if needed to rotate the potatoes.\n\n**\\*Baking Time:**  We highly recommend using a ceramic/enamel lined Dutch oven with a tightly fitting lid as it intensifies the heat and conducts heat better.  Whenever you are cooking potatoes with tomatoes, the acid from the tomatoes toughens the potatoes’ cellular wall and makes it harder for liquids to penetrate and soften the potatoes.  In other words, it will take longer in the oven for the potatoes than one might traditionally think.  We have had Readers tell us that when they **don’t use** a Dutch oven that it has taken up to 75 to 90 minutes for their potatoes to soften.  Additionally, constantly opening the oven door loses temperature in the oven adding additional time for the potatoes to soften.\n\n**\\*Sea Salt:**  Please adjust the sea salt based upon your family’s sea salt preferences and/or based upon dietary needs.\n\n**\\*Serving:**  Makes 4-5 servings.\n\n**\\*Storage:**  Refrigerate and use within 5 days.\n\n![](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AmeeraRobinSignoff.png)\n\n_This post contains affiliate links, and we may receive a very small commission if you purchase through those links at no additional cost to you.

Please read my [disclosure policy](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_This roasted sweet potato and arugula salad recipe features some of my favorite fall flavors and always tastes so delicious this time of year._\n\n![Favorite Fall Salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-8.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette. It's the perfect vegetarian salad for fall and always so delicious! | gimmesomeoven.com\")\n\nThings are finally _(fi-na-lly!)_ cooling off here in Barcelona this week after the summer’s unrelenting heat wave, which of course instantly has me craving all of my nostalgic fall faves…including this yummy roasted sweet potato and arugula salad. ♡\n\nIt’s a simple one that you could easily make anytime of year. But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like. And if you feel like adding in an extra protein, some grilled chicken or bacon would be delicious mixed in too.\n\nLet’s make some salad together!  \n\n![Favorite Fall Salad Ingredients](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-1.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

We’ll then dice them into 1/2-inch cubes, toss with olive oil, season generously with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n*   **Greens:** I’m partial to the peppery flavor of fresh arugula in this salad, but you could also use baby kale (or other varieties of kale), baby spinach, or any other salad greens that you prefer.\n*   **Avocado:** Feel free to dice or thinly slice the avocado, which adds a lovely creaminess to the salad.\n*   **Crumbled cheese:** I love the tart and tangy flavor of goat cheese in this salad, but feta, blue, cheddar, or Manchego cheese would be delicious alternatives too.\n*   **Nuts:** Just about any of your favorite nuts or seeds will work well in this salad — pecans, walnuts, almonds, pepitas, you choose!\n*   **Dried berries:** Dried cranberries always feel so quintessentially fall-ish to me, but dried cherries, raisins or even apricots would work well too.\n*   **Dressing:** My [everyday salad dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/salad-dressing/) goes beautifully with this salad, made with a quick blend of olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, garlic, salt and pepper.\n\n![Step by step instructions for how to make favorite fall salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fall-Salad-Collage.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

For example, you are welcome to…\n\n*   **Add a protein:** Cooked chicken, bacon, steak, shrimp or tofu would be delicious mixed in here.\n*   **Add other mix-ins:** Extra roasted veggies (such as beets, butternut squash, carrots, fennel, green beans or pumpkin), extra fresh veggies (bell pepper, radishes, red onion), rice or grains (quinoa, farro, wild rice), beans, olives, or sun-dried tomatoes would be other fun options for mix-ins.\n*   **Use a different dressing:** I also love making this salad with my [dreamy tahini dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/dreamy-tahini-dressing/) for a different spin on the recipe.\n*   **Make it vegan:** Swap your favorite vegan cheese in place of goat cheese, or omit the cheese altogether and add in a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.\n\n![Favorite Fall Salad in Bowl with Lemon Vinaigrette](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-5.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

Fall comfort food at it’s best!\n\nwhy these pumpkin ravioli are the BEST\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   Homemade pumpkin ravioli are easy and fun to make plus they are super impressive and .. you know.. there’s all that street cred 🙂\n*   Tender pumpkin ravioli simmered in sage butter topped off with apple bites and toasted pecans. So much savoy goodness on one plate!\n*   Easy to make double batches of pumpkin ravioli so you have plenty in the freezer for a quick meal or to share with friends.\n\nTo make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, you will need:\n\n*   All purpose flour\n*   Eggs\n*   Olive oil\n*   Ricotta cheese\n*   Pumpkin puree\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Seasonings\n*   Butter\n*   Fresh sage leaves\n*   Apple\n*   Apple cider vinegar\n*   Walnuts\n\n**how do you make pumpkin ravioli?**\n------------------------------------\n\nEasy! To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-e1541953546118.jpg)\n\nThen roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-e1541953605651.jpg)\n\nUsing your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame.\n\nLightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce remove excess dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-e1541953690862.jpg)\n\nLift your tray and carefully turn upside down on a parchment paper lined baking tray. \n\nThe pumpkin ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. \n\nCollect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of pumpkin raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n\nAdd your fresh pumpkin ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. \n\nsage butter, apples and pecans\n------------------------------\n\nWhile your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat.  You want to stir them often or they will burn. \n\nCook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant.  Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside.\n\nNext, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat.  Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce apples and butter](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-e1541953820985.jpg)\n\nThen add your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 – 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry.\n\nOnce your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumpkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat.  Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n\n**pro tips for perfect pumpkin ravioli**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don’t want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY.

Easier to make than you might think, these homemade pumpkin ravioli are tender and full of pumpkin flavor. Made with pumpkin puree, ricotta cheese, fall seasonings and an easy ravioli dough recipe, these pumpkin ravioli are then simmered in a rich sage butter and topped with apples and walnuts.\n\n#### Ravioli Dough\n\n*   3 cups all purpose flour\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   3 large eggs\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   2 teaspoons water\n*   extra flour for rolling\n\n#### Pumpkin Ravoili Filling\n\n*   1 cup ricotta cheese\n*   3/4 cup pumpkin puree\n*   1/3 cup parmesan cheese grated\n*   1 large egg\n*   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n*   1/2 teaspoon allspice\n*   2 tablespoons brown sugar\n*   1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   1/4 teaspoon pepper\n*   non-stick cooking spray\n\n#### Apple Sage Butter\n\n*   1/2 cup butter\n*   16-18 fresh sage leaves chopped or ripped\n*   1 apple - gala or honeycrisp peeled, cored, diced\n*   1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n*   1/4 cup walnuts chopped\n\n#### To Make the Ravioli Dough\n\n*   Easy! To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough. On your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine.  Now, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.  Next, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano. \n    \n*   Now, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture and once the dough starts to look like ... dough .... start kneeding it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. Then form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.  \n    \n\n#### To Make the Pumpkin Ravioli Filling\n\n*   After that hour has passed and you are ready to make your pumpkin ravioli, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. Add in the parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside. \n    \n\n#### To Make the Pumpkin Ravioli\n\n*   On your countertop or a large cutting board, unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide. \n    \n*   At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray. Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well. Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells. Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli. Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed. Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray. The ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n    \n*   Add your fresh ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. While your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat. You want to stir them often or they will burn. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant. Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside. Next, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.  Add in your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 - 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry. Once your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat. Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n    \n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don't want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME.

This creamy pumpkin pasta with toasted walnuts and spinach dish is as flavorful as it is nutritious. Serve it for a fall dinner party or quick weeknight meal._ \n\n![Overhead Pumpkin Pasta with Spinach in bowls with fork](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/522A0433.jpg)\n\nI shared this creamy pumpkin pasta with a room full of people at my “all about pumpkin demo” a couple of weeks ago. Though they loved the smell of it, there were more than a few side-eyes in the room. No one had used pumpkin in pasta before and let’s just say they were skeptical but curious. Well. It was a hit!\n\nMost people said they couldn’t taste the pumpkin. And that’s not surprising. Pumpkin doesn’t have a strong flavor. The flavors we associate with pumpkin usually come from the spices paired with it. There is one major exception. Fresh pumpkin can be incredible when it’s roasted until it’s caramelized and sweet.\n\n[This 20-minute Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts & Spinach is perfect for fall!](https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=This%2020-minute%20Pumpkin%20Pasta%20with%20Toasted%20Walnuts%20%26amp%3B%20Spinach%20is%20perfect%20for%20fall%21%20%23easyrecipes&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarisamoore.com%2Fpumpkin-pasta-toasted-walnuts-spinach%2F&via=marisamoore)\n\nThat’s not what I’m using today. Maybe later. Today, I used leftover canned pumpkin to make a luscious, silky smooth pumpkin pasta sauce that’s full of nutrition. It’s got vitamin C, beta-carotene, and fiber which can help keep the immune system and your skin glowing as the weather starts to cool down.\n\nYou can use any pasta you’d like. For more protein and fiber but without changing the flavor of the dish too much, I suggest using chickpea pasta. I prefer it to whole wheat or some of the other “healthy” pasta options.\n\nIf you’re living on the edge, boil some water and cook some old school, regular white pasta! I’m just being sarcastic. Use the pasta that works for you and your family. Just don’t overcook it.\n\nCan you make a dairy-free pumpkin sauce?\n----------------------------------------\n\nYes. I used a little half and half in this recipe because it adds a lovely texture and richness to the sauce. If you are avoiding dairy, try adding a bit more olive oil and broth instead of milk or cream. This substitution will also make the recipe more of a pantry meal.\n\nThe parmesan is, of course, a nice savory, salty addition. You can leave it out for a vegan recipe. If you find that the recipe needs a little something else, add a little What’s the Deal with Nutritional Yeast? to the sauce and blend until smooth.\n\n![Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts and Spinach in bowls with two forks](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Exported-4-2.jpg)\n\nHow to make pumpkin pasta sauce\n-------------------------------\n\nFor the sauce: sauté fresh garlic in olive oil just until fragrant. Add the other ingredients and let it simmer. I found that this sauce tastes better the longer it simmers. It tastes even better the next day, so it’s the perfect pumpkin pasta sauce for meal prep! I stored it in a mason jar and used it throughout the week. It also freezes well on its own.\n\nOnce the pumpkin sauce is ready,  add a couple of large handfuls of baby spinach. Add in the pasta and heat the dish just until all are heated through and the spinach wilts.\n\n![Front view Pumpkin Pasta with Spinach in bowls with fork](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pumpkin-Pasta-with-Spinach-in-bowls-with-fork-at-bottom.jpg)\n\nDish it up and top with roasted walnuts and grated Parmesan to make it pretty and to add extra flavor and texture. This pumpkin pasta dish would be an impressive vegetarian dish to serve at fall dinner parties but it’s also quick and easy enough for a fast weeknight meal.\n\nKids and adults will both love it. It’s also a tasty way to use up any extra canned pumpkin you might have leftover. This recipe will keep in the fridge for about 3 days.\n\nWays to use up leftover canned pumpkin\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you open up a new can of pumpkin for this recipe and need to use up the rest, here are a few [tips for using up leftover pumpkin](https://marisamoore.com/how-to-use-leftover-canned-pumpkin-puree/):\n\n1.  Double this pumpkin pasta sauce recipe. I’m a huge fan of cooking (and cleaning) once and eating twice! You won’t regret having an extra batch of this sauce ready to go in a month.\n2.  Make my easy [homemade pumpkin spice granola](https://marisamoore.com/healthy-pumpkin-spice-granola/)!\n3.  Stir extra pumpkin into oats or Greek yogurt.\n4.

It tastes better the day after you make it!\n*   Reheat the pumpkin sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Add warm broth to help thin it out if needed.\n\nCalories: 388kcal\n\n[Let us know](#comment) how it was!"

    "markdown": "# Nourishing Vegan Yellow Pumpkin Curry | Ambitious Kitchen\nI’m back again with another glorious recipe for #AKPumpkinWeek!\n\nYes, we’re going savory again and I’m not mad about it. I hope you aren’t either. This year I told myself that I wanted to incorporate more savory recipes into Ambitious Kitchen — you know delicious weeknight dinners you can always depend on to make you feel creative, healthy and satisfied.\n\nSo here we are with a beautiful chickpea vegan **yellow pumpkin curry**. My oh my is it GOOD. No wait, not just good, it’s DAMN good. FANTASTIC. CREAMY. COMFORTING. FULL OF UMAMI FLAVORS. EPIC. A MUST MAKE.\n\nYou get the point, right?\n\nWant more slow cooker recipes?\n------------------------------\n\nEnter your email to get one of our **BEST slow cooker dinner recipes** straight to your inbox each day for 7 days. Totally FREE!\n\n![pumpkin curry with rice and cilantro in a bowl with a spoon](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-5.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nIngredients in this pumpkin curry recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\nI was so thrilled when I first developed this vegan pumpkin curry recipe because of how nourishing it was. It’s full of anti-inflammatory ingredients, fiber, plant-based protein and just so happens to be both vegan and gluten free. Here’s what you need to make it:\n\n*   **Fresh cubed pumpkin:** instead of pumpkin puree in the curry we’re using fresh pumpkin! If you’ve never cooked a real pumpkin before, I suggest giving it a try. Check out my how to cook and dice a pumpkin tutorial [here](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-cook-a-pumpkin-homemade-pumpkin-puree/).\n*   **Chickpeas:** Always a favorite [legume](https://amzn.to/33WapUr) of mine because of their delicious flavor and ability to add plant based protein to any dish.\n*   **Lots of veggies:** Not only does this recipe involve pumpkin, but also cauliflower, carrots, red bell pepper, green onion and peas. So yes, it’s time to #eatyourveggies.\n*   **Light coconut milk:** I like using a [light canned coconut milk](https://amzn.to/3j5RYmA) in this dish because it’s not as rich as regular full fat coconut milk. There’s still a lot of coconut flavor though.\n*   **Vegetarian broth:** a little bit of [vegetable broth](https://amzn.to/3mPmvY9) adds the right amount of liquid to this curry recipe.\n*   **Soy sauce:** I recommend a low sodium [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/364GTyv) and be sure it’s gluten free if you want to keep this recipe gluten free. You can also use coconut aminos.\n*   **Peanut butter:** To bring the dish together, you must add a little [peanut butter](https://amzn.to/3kJ82er). It gives the recipe a unique umami flavor that helps to bring everything together. If you’re not into peanut butter, try cashew butter or even tahini.\n*   **The anti-inflammatory trio:** aka fresh garlic, ginger and [turmeric](https://amzn.to/33RpzKE). Not only do these three bring flavor to the dish but also help to boost your immune system with health benefits. Ginger is great for your digestive system, garlic helps fight bacteria, and turmeric provides an anti-inflammatory boost. I’m in loveeeee.\n*   **Cozy spices:** you’ll also be using [yellow curry powder](https://amzn.to/366ByqC) and a pinch of [cayenne pepper](https://amzn.to/2RVYwIv). I like to use curry powder instead of yellow curry paste for ease.\n*   **Brown rice:** we’re serving this delicious curry with a fragrant coconut [brown rice](https://amzn.to/3kJ8j0X).\n\n![yellow pumpkin curry with rice and cilantro in a bowl](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-4.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nWhat kind of pumpkin should you use for pumpkin curry?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI love to use pie pumpkins or a sugar pumpkin. No, you don’t cook the pumpkins you decorate for Halloween! Look for a brighter orange pumpkin that’s about 3-6 pounds — that’s when the flesh is the best for cooking. Really, any winter squash will work in this yellow curry recipe.\n\nCan’t find the perfect pumpkin?\n-------------------------------\n\nFeel free to use cubed sweet potato instead! You’ll add either to the recipe in the same way.\n\n![yellow pumpkin curry with rice in a bowl next to a fork](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-2.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nHow to make yellow pumpkin curry\n--------------------------------\n\n1.  **Make the brown rice.** Add your brown rice to a pan along with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil. Toast it over medium heat for 1 minute until fragrant. Next add 2 1/4 cups of water to a pot; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to sit in the pot with the lid on for 10 minutes so that the rice gets nice and fluffy.\n2.  **Cook the veggies.** Cook the ginger and garlic in a large pot with coconut oil for about 30 seconds, then add in all of your veggies except the bell pepper. Saute for about 5 minutes until cauliflower and pumpkin begin to get tender.\n3.  **Add spices & broth.** Next, add our spices and spices for 30 seconds before stirring in coconut milk, broth, peanut butter, soy sauce, salt and pepper. Allow to cook 5 minutes more, then stir in bell pepper and chickpeas and simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes.\n4.  **Don’t forget the greens!** Before serving, stir in frozen peas and simmer for an additional minute. Taste, and adjust seasonings as necessary.\n5.  **Garnish & serve.** Pour the curry into bowls or divide it into meal prep containers. Garnish with cilantro (or Thai basil if you’re feelin’ fancy) and chopped peanuts and serve with your rice!\n\nWhat to serve with vegan pumpkin curry\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis incredible yellow chickpea pumpkin curry recipe includes a fabulous coconut brown rice to pair with the curry, but you could always enjoy it with:\n\n*   [Fluffy quinoa](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-cook-the-best-fluffy-quinoa-plus-recipes/ \"How to Cook the Best Fluffy Quinoa (plus recipes!)\")\n*   [Cauliflower rice](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice/ \"How to Make Cauliflower Rice\")\n*   Or a side of naan to soak up all of that delicious yellow pumpkin curry sauce!\n\n![vegan pumpkin curry in a bowl with rice](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pumpkincurry-3.jpg \"Nourishing yellow chickpea pumpkin curry simmered in cozy spices and served with fragrant coconut brown rice. This vegan pumpkin curry recipe is packed with plant based protein and perfect for meal prep!\")\n\nHow to store & freeze pumpkin curry\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   **In the fridge:** store this yellow pumpkin curry in the refrigerator for up to 4 days in an airtight container.\n*   **In the freezer:** Be sure to not overcook the vegetables. Let the curry cool completely before transferring it to a freezer safe bag or container. Freeze for up to 2 months. I would not recommend freezing the pumpkin curry with rice. To reheat it, simply thaw the chickpea pumpkin curry in the refrigerator. While the curry is thawing, feel free to make rice, cauliflower rice or quinoa to serve with it. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave for 2 minutes until heated through.\n\nMore cozy recipes you’ll love\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Slow Cooker Black Bean Quinoa Pumpkin Chicken Chili](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/slow-cooker-black-bean-quinoa-pumpkin-chicken-chili/)\n*   [Spicy Black Bean Chicken Enchiladas with Pumpkin Sour Cream Sauce](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/spicy-black-bean-chicken-enchiladas-with-pumpkin-sour-cream-sauce-2/)\n*   [Healing Lemongrass Chickpea Thai Green Curry with Toasted Coconut Brown Rice](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healing-lemongrass-chickpea-thai-green-curry/)\n*   [Curry Roasted Cauliflower Sweet Potato Salad (whole30, vegan & gluten free)](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/curry-roasted-cauliflower-sweet-potato-salad/)\n*   [Thai Peanut Coconut Cauliflower Chickpea Curry](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/thai-peanut-coconut-cauliflower-chickpea-curry/)\n\nWant more slow cooker recipes?\n------------------------------\n\nEnter your email to get one of our **BEST slow cooker dinner recipes** straight to your inbox each day for 7 days.

How do you feel? I was a little suspicious back in the day, but if I give the kale a good massage and add a lot of different toppings, I can now get pretty excited about them. If you’re not into kale salads yet, let me see if I can sell you: we’re adding juicy peaches and blueberries, creamy goat cheese, and perfectly salty-sweet candied pecans.\n\nCANDIED PECANS! Sorry to shout, but they’re so good, and they’re super easy and quick to make on the stovetop in less than ten minutes. No fuss, no oven. And you may want to make a double batch, because it’s hard to stop snacking on them. I ate a lot of mine before the salad even got dressed!\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8777/28089678120_7875bc7005_o.jpg)\n\nIn other news, I have a serious peach problem. Last summer, we got down to Chattanooga at the end of peach session, right after [**The Peach Truck**](https://thepeachtruck.com/) had left town. I was so mad I had missed out. All year I waited and checked the schedule. And when they came to East Ridge a little over a week ago, I was there. I bought a [**25-pound box of peaches**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHnJEUdjlqw/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk) and a one-pound bag of pecans.\n\nSince then, it’s been all peaches all the time. In addition to eating an embarrassing number of them out of hand, juice dripping everywhere, I’ve made a [**peach dutch baby**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHuI8GPjCl0/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk), [**peach margaritas**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH0nlumjGdT/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk) (I shared the full recipe [**on Insta**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH0nlumjGdT/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk)–they’re so good!), peach muffins, and peach ice cream.\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8834/27756526903_ab5be3a9af_o.jpg)\n\nI have a few more peaches stashed in the fridge, and finally got around to a savory application: this summer kale salad. It’s pretty much an all-local salad because the kale is from my [**Big Sycamore Farm**](http://www.bigsycamorefarm.com/) CSA and the peaches and pecans are from Georgia (I live in TN but I’m just a few minutes from the GA border).\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8845/27756526603_e2a4a990ff_o.jpg)\n\nI picked the blueberries this weekend up at my friend [**Lindsey**](https://lindseylowephoto.wordpress.com/)‘s family’s place on [**Lookout Mountain**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BH8aiM0DGBp/?taken-by=acalculatedwhisk), and they gave me this amazing goat cheese they made themselves with milk from their own goats. I’m pretty sure I live in the best, most delicious place on earth!\n\n![Summer Kale Salad with Peaches and Candied Pecans](https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8608/28376099415_ab92db2430_o.jpg)\n\nThis summer kale salad is so easy and so fast, and you’ll feel a wonderfully healthy glow after eating it. Happy summer!  \n\nInstructions\n------------\n\n1.  To make the candied pecans, heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the pecan halves, maple syrup, smoked paprika, and a couple of pinches of sea salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until the pecans are coated in a sticky glaze and no liquid remains in the pan, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pecans to a parchment-lined plate and spread them out in a single layer to cool.\n2.  Mix all the dressing ingredients with a fork in a large bowl. Add the kale leaves, toss to coat them with the dressing, and massage them by hand until reduced in volume, darker green, and tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the kale to a platter or divide it between individual serving plates. Top with the peach slices, blueberries, crumbled goat cheese, and candied pecans.\n\n###### Nutrition Information:\n\nYield: 4 Serving Size: 1 small serving  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 372Total Fat: 31gSaturated Fat: 7gTrans Fat: 0gUnsaturated Fat: 23gCholesterol: 14mgSodium: 127mgCarbohydrates: 21gFiber: 6gSugar: 10gProtein: 8g\n\n_The nutrition label provided is an estimate for informational purposes only and may not be accurate.

Grilled Greek chicken (or roasted), served bowl style with orzo, roasted peppers, avocado, feta cheese, cucumbers, and the most deliciously addicting sizzled mint goddess sauce. It doesn’t get easier or more delicious than this grilled chicken…simple, quick, extra colorful, super flavorful, and so delicious. The perfect dinner to serve any night of the week!\n\n![overhead photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and olive on table](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-1-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nBasically I am full on ready for summer, and this recipe proves it. I know it’s only mid April, but in my defense, I feel like most everyone (in the US at least) is slowly beginning to experience warmer days that are fit for grilling. Are you? My fingers are crossed that you are, but if not, don’t worry, you can easily roast this chicken too!\n\nEither way, this is the perfect recipe for Monday. It also feels very April appropriate – healthy, colorful, and delicious! All very important things.\n\nWith Easter this Sunday, I have Greek food on my mind. Something about Easter always inspires me to create recipes with a Greek influence. I say influence because I know that my recipes may not be traditional, but this is my personal spin on a more traditional recipe.\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5032-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5052-700x1050.jpg)\n\nLast year I even made my first [spanakopita](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-spinach-and-feta-pie-spanakopita/ \"Greek Spinach and Feta Pie (Spanakopita).\") (Greek spinach and feta pie), along with these [Greek orzo stuffed peppers](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-orzo-stuffed-red-peppers/ \"Greek Orzo Stuffed Red Peppers with Lemony Basil Tomatoes.\")! Both of which are some of my favorite spring and summer recipes. And then there’s these [Greek lamb meatballs](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-lamb-meatballs-with-avocado-goddess-sauce/ \"Greek Lamb Meatballs with Avocado Goddess Sauce.\"), which so many of you have made and seem to have loved.

I make it every chance I get, which honestly is not often enough, as I’m consistently testing new recipes.\n\nPoint is, I love the flavors so very much, but more often than not I end up having chicken on hand opposed to ground lamb. Soo, enter the chicken version of these bowls. But made in a very different way, because well, I never seem to make the same recipe twice. Both bowls are SO GOOD, but right now I am all about this Greek chicken.\n\nAnd it feels kind of fitting for Easter, doesn’t it?\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5054-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5065-700x1050.jpg)\n\nI marinate the chicken in quite possibly one of my favorite marinades. It’s a combination of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika (which is not really “Greek”…but it’s good), fresh oregano, shallots (the secret!), garlic, and lots of lemon (always so much lemon). Now, when I say marinate, I really just mean toss the chicken in this mix and let it sit while you get everything else for the bowls together. I’m not sure about you guys, but I can never plan ahead enough to cook a recipe requiring a long marinate time.\n\nIt almost never happens…\n\nSo, I do a quick marinade. It works.\n\n![close up photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-2-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nWhile the chicken is “marinating”, make the sizzled mint goddess sauce.\n\nHere’s the truth, I really do not love mint. I find it overpowers most recipe. Unless it’s a [cocktail](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/category/recipes/drinks/), in which case I think mint is perfect, did you see these [mojitos](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/white-tea-and-muddled-basil-mojito/ \"White Tea and Muddled Basil Mojito.\")? Mint used in savory dishes however, well it throws me off. Until today. Cooking mint in olive oil really mellows out the flavor and makes the mint much less pungent. I found it to be perfect when stirred into a yogurt based goddess sauce. Which I am now spooning over everything, so addicting. Roasted salmon and potatoes are especially delicious.\n\nOnce the sauce is made and the chicken is grilled, it’s assembly time! I used orzo pasta as my grain, but feel free to use quinoa, couscous, or brown rice. Any would be great.\n\nI then layered in some roasted red peppers, avocado, cucumbers, olives, and even some arugula. Lots of veggies… and a good amount of feta cheese too.\n\nSuper pretty, on the (very) healthy side, and so very delicious.\n\n![side angled photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and fork in bowl ](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-4-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nThe added bonus about this recipe is that it’s so great for weekday meal prep. I recommend making this on a Sunday or Monday night and doubling the recipe. Then simply use the leftovers to make lunch or dinner bowls to enjoy throughout the week!\n\nCook everything at once…get multiple meals…love that!\n\nSo excited to be sharing this recipe with you guys. It’s one of those dishes I just know you will love!\n\n![overhead close up photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce ](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-3-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nIf you make these Greek lemon chicken bowls, be sure to leave a comment and/or give this recipe a rating!

    "markdown": "# Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad - Crowded Kitchen\nThis summery salad makes the most of fresh produce with an arugula base, fresh blackberries, blueberries, cucumber, avocado, hazelnuts, feta and a lime mint vinaigrette.\n\nIf you haven't tried putting berries in a salad before, you're really missing out. They add pops of texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Blackberries and blueberries pair particularly well with refreshing cucumbers, creamy avocado and zesty arugula.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad on a white platter](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-5.jpg)\n\nThis is the perfect salad to enjoy all summer long because it's easy to make, packed with summer fruit, and is super refreshing on a hot day.\n\nYou can also add a grilled protein (tofu, chicken or shrimp), beans (white beans or chickpeas) or a grain (quinoa, wild rice) for a more filling meal.\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad](#blackberry-avocado-and-arugula-salad)\n*   [How to make this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad](#how-to-make-this-blackberry-avocado-and-arugula-salad)\n*   [Substitutions and Variations](#substitutions-and-variations)\n*   [What to Serve with this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad:](#what-to-serve-with-this-blackberry-avocado-and-arugula-salad)\n*   [Storage](#storage)\n*   [Tips and FAQ](#tips-and-faq)\n*   [Top tip](#top-tip)\n*   [More summer salad recipes](#more-summer-salad-recipes)\n*   [📖 Recipe](#%f0%9f%93%96-recipe)\n*   [💬 Reviews](#comments)\n\n![overhead view of ingredients for summer salad](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-3.jpg)\n\n### For the salad:\n\n*   **Arugula**: baby arugula is the perfect choice for this salad.\n*   **Blackberries and Blueberries:** use both, or one or the other.\n*   **Cucumber**: we used mini cucumbers, which are super crunchy, and thinly sliced them into rounds. You can also make ribbons with a peeler.\n*   **Avocado**: the riper, the better! We sliced them in this salad, but you can also dice them to distribute them better.\n*   **Feta**: Any kind will work in this recipe! You can also use vegan feta to keep this recipe dairy free.\n*   **Hazelnuts**: chopped, toasted or un-toasted.\n\n### For the lime mint vinaigrette:\n\n*   **Olive oil:** Extra virgin will have the best flavor.\n*   **Lime juice:** be sure to use freshly squeezed.\n*   **Mint:** We used fresh, not dried mint in this recipe.\n*   **Salt and pepper:** Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper for seasoniong.\n*   **Sweetener**: you can use maple syrup, agave, or honey.\n\n![close up view of blackberry avocado arugula salad on a white platter](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-8.jpg)\n\nHow to make this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's so easy, you don't even really need instructions, but here they are:\n\n**STEP 1**: Whisk together all the ingredients for the vinaigrette.\n\n**STEP 2**: Add all of the ingredients to a bowl, pour vinaigrette over, and toss. Enjoy!\n\nSubstitutions and Variations\n----------------------------\n\n**Arugula:** Feel free to substitute with spinach, baby kale, or another leafy green.\n\n**Blackberries and blueberries** can be swapped with strawberries, raspberries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, or just about any other summer fruit.\n\n**Not a fan of hazelnuts?** Try swapping with pine nuts, pistachios or pecans.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad in blue bowl](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-13.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with this Blackberry, Avocado and Arugula Salad:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**To turn this blackberry avocado arugula salad into a meal**: add a protein and/or grain. Cooked quinoa or wild rice both make fantastic additions.\n\nI also love adding white beans for a bit of extra plant-based protein. I let them marinade in a few tablespoons of the vinaigrette to soak up extra flavor. You could also top with grilled tofu, or chicken, shrimp or steak.\n\n![overhead view of blackberry avocado arugula salad in blue bowl](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blackberry-Cucumber-Salad-10.jpg)\n\nStorage\n-------\n\nYou can make this salad and the dressing ahead of time, just make sure to keep them separate if you are storing for longer than a day or two, or else the salad will be too soggy.\n\nOnce dressed, this salad can be kept in an airtight container but should be eaten the next day.\n\nTips and FAQ\n------------\n\nTop tip\n-------\n\nCutting everything into similarly-sized pieces will make this salad easier to toss, and easier to eat.\n\n**Can I use gorgonzola instead of feta?  \n**\n\nAbsolutely! Since not everyone is used to eating feta, gorgonzola or tiny mozzarella balls can be substituted in.\n\nMore summer salad recipes\n-------------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad with Pomegranate and Candied Pecans\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprout-salad-2/)\n*   [\n    \n    Citrus Burrata Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/citrus-burrata-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    White Bean Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/white-bean-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Greek Chickpea Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/greek-chickpea-salad/)\n\n### **Tried this recipe?**\n\n**Please leave a star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating below** and/or a review in the comments section further down the page.

    "markdown": "# Cilantro Lime Chicken {With a Mango Salsa!} - Chelsea's Messy Apron\n[Skip to content](#content)\n\n**Cilantro Lime Chicken** is both simple and flavorful! Pair it with cilantro-lime rice and mango avocado salsa for a delicious, healthy meal.\n\n ![Cilantro Lime Chicken on a bed of rice with fresh salsa.](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CILANTRO-LIME-CHICKEN-CHELSEASMESSYAPRON-1200-2.jpeg)\n\nThe marinade for this Cilantro-Lime Chicken is everything a good marinade should be: it’s easy to whip together, has so much flavor, and doesn’t contain any “strange” ingredients. This recipe also pairs really well with my [mango salsa-](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-mango-salsa/)\\-I always make it as a side when I make this dish. I’d recommend giving it a shot!\n\n ![All the ingredients for this recipe prepped out for easy assembly.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201300'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow To Make Cilantro-Lime Chicken\n---------------------------------\n\n1.  **Whisk together the marinade**: Remove about 1/2 cup of the marinade (we’ll use it later).\n2.  **Prep** **the chicken**: You want to pound chicken breasts to an even thickness so they’ll cook evenly later on. This is best accomplished by a [meat mallet](https://amzn.to/2SS6sbV).\n3.  **Marinate**: Place the chicken in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.\n4.  **Cook**: Grill, bake, or saute the chicken until it reaches 165 degrees F. (Take the guesswork out by using a [digital meat thermometer.](https://amzn.to/2TeVMZ3))\n5.  **Baste**: As you cook the chicken, brush it occasionally with the reserved marinade mix. \n\n ![The marinade being whisked together and added to the chicken for this cilantro lime chicken recipe.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nRecipe Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Make sure to **slice the chicken in half, or pound it** to an even thickness _before_ marinating. This allows the chicken to soak up more flavor from the marinade (improves taste), and the even thickness will allow it to cook evenly.\n*   If grilling, **generously oil your grill grates**. I do this by rolling up a few paper towels, drenching them in oil (I use canola), and using tongs, rub the drenched paper towels along the grill grates. Doing this will contribute to a beautiful sear, and ensure the chicken doesn’t stick to the grates.\n*   If grilling, **fully** **preheat** **your** **grill.** I know it’s hard to wait, but adding meat to a fully preheated grill will sear the surface of the meat–and that gives you a juicier chicken. It also allows the chicken to get a great char.\n*   As the chicken is cooking, **brush the reserved marinade on the chicken**. Doing this will further enhance the flavor.\n*   Once it’s finished, **let the cooked chicken rest**, tented with foil, for 5-10 minutes before cutting in!\n\n ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20105%20134'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n### QUICK TIP\n\nMangoes have a large pit inside and that makes it tricky to slice them. Here’s a helpful visual guide: [how to cut a mango.](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/how-to-cut-a-mango/)\n\n ![The mango salsa being mixed together in a bowl.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nMake It A Meal\n--------------\n\nOne of the things I love about this recipe is how easily it pairs with other sides. Below are a few of my favorites to serve with this meal:\n\n*   **Mango-avocado salsa**: The salsa has an outstanding texture that pairs perfectly with Cilantro-Lime Chicken.  The sweetness of the mango and the orange juice perfectly balance the tang of all the cilantro and lime from the chicken marinade. Check out the [mango salsa](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-mango-salsa/) recipe or find it in the recipe card below as well.\n*   **Cilantro-Lime Chicken and Rice**: Serve Cilantro-Lime Chicken over cilantro-lime quinoa or rice for an amazing meal. I’ve included my favorite recipe for cilantro lime rice (or quinoa) in the recipe notes section.\n*   **Cilantro-Lime Chicken Taco Salad**: To convert this recipe into a salad, finely chop some romaine lettuce, add the (cooled) chopped chicken, your favorite veggies (such as cherry tomatoes, chopped bell peppers, cucumber, etc.), and the dressing from this [quinoa black bean salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/quinoa-black-bean-salad/).\n\n ![The cilantro lime rice being made in a pot to go with the cilantro lime chicken.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nAlternate Cooking Methods\n-------------------------\n\nCooking times will vary, depending on several factors, so I always recommend using a thermometer to test your chicken as it cooks. Aim to hit exactly 165 degrees F. (Undercooked = unsafe; Overcooked = dry chicken)\n\n*   **Baked Cilantro-Lime Chicken:** Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Place chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Bake for approximately 18 minutes, flipping the chicken halfway through. Remove from the oven, and loosely cover the sheet pan with foil.  Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes.\n*   **Sautéed Cilantro-Lime Chicken:** Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken breast(s) and cook for 4-6 minutes per side until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear. As you sauté the chicken, brush it generously with the reserved marinade. Transfer the chicken to a clean plate, loosely cover with foil, and let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes.\n\n ![The Cilantro Lime Chicken on a bed of rice with fresh mango salsa on it ready to be enjoyed.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nCilantro-Lime Chicken Sides\n---------------------------\n\n*   [Fruit Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/blackberry-lime-fruit-salad-with-orange-zest/) (Rave reviews!)\n*   [Mandarin Orange Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/orange-apple-salad-with-an-orange-poppyseed-dressing/) (Best dressing!)\n*   [Roasted Brussel Sprouts](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-parmesan-brussels-sprouts/) (Reader favorite!)\n*   [Roasted Sweet Potatoes](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/roasted-sweet-potatoes/) (Incredible seasoning blend!)\n*   [Grilled Corn on the Cob](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/perfectly-grilled-corn-on-the-cob-recipe-1956289)\n\n### Chicken Marinade\n\n*   ▢ 1-1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)\n*   ▢ 3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, plus 1 tsp zest\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup olive oil\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, plus 1 tsp zest\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon honey\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 2-1/2 tablespoons regular soy sauce\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons minced garlic\n*   ▢ 1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro,\n*   ▢ 1 tsp [salt](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Morton-Salt-Fine-Sea-Salt-Fast-Dissolving-for-Marinades-Soups-and-Dressings-17-6-oz-Canister/10849552?athbdg=L1100&from=/search) & 1/4 tsp [pepper](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GV-CLUB-BLCK-PPR-I/46861995?athbdg=L1100&from=/search)\n\n*   **MARINADE:** Whisk together all of the marinade ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Reserve about 1/2 cup of marinade, and pour the rest into a large resealable bag.\n    \n*   **CHICKEN**: Trim the chicken of fat. Pound the breasts to even thickness or slice in half to get evenly sized breasts and place in the bag with the rest of the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, making sure to flip the bag halfway through. I recommend marinating for 2-6 hours.\n    \n*   **COOK CHICKEN: The instructions below are to grill the chicken. To see other methods of cooking chicken, read the portion of the post that is right above this recipe card.** Lightly oil the grill grate or grill ridges on a grill pan or add 1 tablespoon oil to a skillet and then place the marinated chicken on the grill. Discard leftover marinade.\n    \n*   **COOK, CONT.**: Grill for 10-12 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and internal temperature is at 165 degrees F. Flip the chicken halfway and brush it generously with the reserved 1/2 cup marinade.\n    \n*   **MANGO SALSA:** Prepare [mango-avocado salsa](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-mango-salsa/).\n    \n*   **RICE**: If desired, prepare cilantro-lime or coconut rice.\n    \n*   **ASSEMBLY:** Serve grilled chicken over a bed of rice (if prepared) and add spoonfuls of the salsa on top. Enjoy immediately!\n    \n\nCooking times will vary, depending on several factors, so I always recommend using a thermometer to test your chicken as it cooks. Aim to hit exactly 165 degrees F.

Wash and chop fresh spinach, or thaw and drain frozen spinach.\n2.  **Cook the Pasta Shells**: Boil salted water and cook jumbo pasta shells until al dente. Drain and set aside.\n\n![Spinach and ricotta filling for shells.](https://saltedmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ricotta-Stuffed-Shells-2-2.jpg)\n\n3.  **Prepare the Filling**:\n    *   Heat olive oil over medium heat in a skillet. Sauté minced garlic until fragrant.\n    *   Add spinach and cook until wilted (fresh) or heated through (frozen). Season with salt and pepper.\n    *   Combine ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, egg, nutmeg (if using), and the spinach mixture. Mix well.\n4.  **Assemble the Dish**:\n    *   Spread marinara sauce at the bottom of a baking dish.\n    *   Stuff pasta shells with the cheese and spinach mixture. Place seam side up in the dish.\n    *   Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the stuffed shells. Sprinkle extra mozzarella on top.\n5.  **Bake**:\n    *   Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.\n    *   Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.\n\n💡 **Chef's Guide: Expert Tips**\n--------------------------------\n\nDrawing from a decade in Michelin-starred kitchens and Cordon Bleu training, here are my top tips for recipe success.\n\n*   **Perfectly Cooked Shells**: Ensure pasta shells are cooked al dente to avoid becoming mushy during baking.\n*   **Squeeze Spinach Well**: If using frozen spinach, make sure to squeeze out all excess water to prevent the filling from becoming too watery.\n*   **Layering Sauce**: A layer of marinara sauce at the bottom prevents the shells from sticking and adds extra flavor.\n*   **Extra Cheese**: For an extra cheesy top, add mozzarella or even provolone cheese before the final 10 minutes of baking.\n\n📖 Substitutions & Variations\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **Cheese Variations**: Substitute ricotta with mascarpone or add provolone for extra cheesiness.\n*   **Gluten-Free**: Use gluten-free pasta shells to make the dish suitable for gluten-intolerant guests.\n*   **Spice it Up**: Add red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture or sprinkle on top before baking for some heat.\n*   **Herb Substitutions**: Swap basil or parsley with oregano or thyme for a different herbal note.\n\n🍯 **Storing and reheating leftovers**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   **Fridge:** Store any leftover ricotta stuffed shells in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n*   **Freezer:** Place the stuffed shells in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them individually before transferring them to a freezer-safe container or bag. They can be frozen for up to 2-3 months.\n*   **Reheat:**\n    *   **From the fridge**: Reheat in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 20 minutes or until heated through.\n    *   **From the freezer**: If frozen, thaw overnight in the fridge before reheating as described above.\n\n❓**Recipe FAQ's**\n-----------------\n\n**Can I make this dish ahead of time?**\n\nAbsolutely! You can prepare the stuffed shells, refrigerate them, and bake just before serving.  \n\n**Can I use other types of cheese besides ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan?**\n\nYes, you can experiment with other cheeses. Fontina or provolone can be a good substitute for mozzarella, and cottage cheese or mascarpone can be used instead of ricotta.  \n\n**I'm gluten-free.

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

With only a few main ingredients, you’ll find these mushrooms don’t require any other bells and whistles to be fabulous, flavorful show stoppers.\n\nThey’re vegetarian (when using vegetarian feta), gluten-free, keto and packed with leafy green vitamins and minerals!\n\n![2 spinach and feta-stuffed mushroom caps on a plate on a table, lined with lace with 2 stacked plates in the background.](https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stuffed-Portobello-Mushrooms-with-Spinach-and-Feta_poster.jpg)\n\nIt’s March and spring is right around the corner – with all my spring clothes from last year that I hope to fit into after a _very_ buttery, breaded, [pumpkin spice snickerdoodley](https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/pumpkin-spice-snickerdoodles/) Fall and Winter. Time to slim down in the healthiest way I know how – with all those wonderful leafy green nutrients… and a little bit of feta.\n\nI love serving stuffed portobello mushrooms as a first course at a dinner party. They can easily be made ahead of time, they look so enticing and also make a perfect complement to an entree like [roasted duck](https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/easy-roasted-duck/) or [beef bourguignon](https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/instant-pot-beef-bourguignon/)!\n\n![2 mushroom caps, a bowl of feta and a bunch of spinach leaves on a cutting board.](https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stuffed-Portobello-Mushrooms-with-Spinach-and-Feta_1.jpg)\n\nHow to Make These Stuffed Mushrooms – Step by Step\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1\\. Preheat oven to **400 F.** Remove as much of the portobello stems from **2 portobello caps** as you can without damaging the caps. You don’t have to remove the mushroom gills. In a medium-size mixing bowl, pour **¼ cup olive oil** and **1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar, and sprinkle with garlic powder and sage spice**. Gently coat the mushrooms in the mixture and set aside to marinate.\n\n2\\. Mince **4 garlic cloves** and set aside.\n\n3\\. Remove the stems from **3 cups of fresh spinach** and coarsely chop. Set aside.\n\n4\\. Add **3 tbsp. olive oil** to a frying pan and brown minced garlic for **3-4 minutes**.\n\n![A collage of 4 numbered images showing how to make stuffed portobello mushrooms.](https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stuffed-Portobello-Mushrooms-with-Spinach-and-Feta_step-by-step_1.jpg)\n\n5\\. Place chopped spinach right on top of the garlic and allow it to wilt down and sauté for **4-5 minutes**. As it wilts, gently stir into the garlic and oil. Sprinkle with **salt and pepper** and set aside when done.\n\n6\\. Place mushroom caps face down in a pyrex or baking sheet and bake for **10 minutes**.\n\n7\\. Remove Pyrex and pour out any liquid if any released. Gently turn caps over and stuff with spinach.\n\n8\\. Sprinkle about **3 tbsp.** of **crumbled feta cheese** **(1½ tbsp. each)** on top of the spinach. Bake for **20 minutes** more and serve.\n\n![A collage of 4 numbered images showing how to make stuffed portobello mushrooms.](https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stuffed-Portobello-Mushrooms-with-Spinach-and-Feta_step-by-step_2.jpg)\n\nCommon Questions\n----------------\n\n**1\\. Can you eat the gills of portobello mushrooms?**\n\nYes. They’re definitely edible, as well as the stems, but the stems have a thicker, more fibrous texture and you’ll want to carefully remove as much of them as you can to make room for the spinach and feta in this recipe.\n\nYou can also remove the gills if you want to make even more room, but it’s not entirely necessary.\n\n**2\\. What’s the difference between “portobello” and “portobella” mushrooms?**\n\nPortobello mushrooms are also referred to as “portobella” mushrooms, and both are correct terms for the same kind of mushroom. It’s only a matter of size.\n\nWhen the cremini mushroom is small, it’s referred to as a “portobella” or “baby bella” mushroom, and when they get bigger, they’re branded as “portobello” mushrooms. It’s as simple as that.\n\n**3\\. Can I use frozen spinach for this recipe?  \n**\n\nYes, you can, although fresh, sautéed spinach has more flavor pizzaz and a brighter green color that just makes for a prettier stuffed mushroom. However, it’s a misconception that frozen spinach is less nutritious.\n\nSpinach is frozen at peak freshness and its nutrition doesn’t diminish, whereas fresh spinach will lose nutritional value while it wilts. So ideally, go for the very freshest spinach, but if you can’t find it, frozen will be just as healthy (just a little less green).\n\nIf you use frozen spinach, make sure to thaw and squeeze out as much water as you can.

I have a batch of cooked quinoa in my fridge at all times and use it in meatless tacos, enchiladas, and salads. It's a healthy protein source and combined with beans and vegetables makes for a delicious and filling dish.\n\nThis Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad is a family favorite right now! It's simple to make and I can store it in individual containers for a healthy lunch throughout the week or as a side dish to grilled chicken. It's wonderful in lettuce cups or tossed with chopped kale too!\n\nIngredients:\n------------\n\n![sweet potatoes, corn, black beans, red onion and quinoa in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-1.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\n*   **sweet potatoes** - The star of this recipe! I cut the potatoes into chunks, toss them with oil and spices, and roast them.\n*   **quinoa** - You can use my recipe for cooking [quinoa in the Instant Pot](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/) (it takes only 1 minute of cooking time!!) or make it on the stove.\n*   **black beans** - You will need one can or 1 and ½ cups of home-cooked beans.\n*   **whole kernel corn** - You will need one can. Drain the water and rinse the corn before adding to the salad. Fresh is great too and can be roasted along with the potatoes! I do not like frozen and thawed-out corn in this salad\n*   **onion** - I prefer red onion for salads. You can use sweet or yellow, whatever you prefer.\n*   **olive oil** - It's a base for the dressing. Use avocado oil, if you prefer.\n*   **lime juice** - Freshly squeezed juice is best here.\n*   **spices** - cumin, paprika, salt, pepper\n*   **garlic** - I prefer fresh, minced garlic. Use garlic powder if you are in a pinch.\n*   **Tajin seasoning** - This ingredient is not necessary but definitely recommended. It is made with ground dried chile peppers, dehydrated lime, and sea salt.\n\nThis healthy and filling salad is very easy to make. It's perfect for meal prep lunch or dinners, when you want something filling but healthy. Here is how to make it:\n\n*   Start with roasting sweet potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, and cumin. They will have a delicious Mexican flair!\n*   Add one can of rinsed and drained black beans, one can of drained whole kernel corn, chopped red onion, and 2 cups of [cooked quinoa](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/).\n*   The dressing is as simple as the salad! Whisk together olive oil, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, and Tajin seasoning. Pour over salad and toss together.\n\n![roasted sweet potato salad in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-5.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHow to roast sweet potatoes for this salad?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRoasting sweet potatoes for a salad or as a simple side dish to your meal prep dishes is very easy. Simply peel potatoes and cut them into cubes, no bigger than ½\". Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and ground cumin. Roast at 400 degrees F for 20 to 23 minutes. Use right away or cool and add to your salad. You can also store them in a container with a lid in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n\nThe dressing:\n-------------\n\nI have plenty of salad recipes with creamy dressings, either mayo-based or healthier with sour cream. For this sweet potato salad, I decided to use a simple olive oil vinaigrette that perfectly complements the potatoes, beans, and quinoa. Mix 4 to 5 tablespoons of olive oil with lime juice, salt, cumin, paprika, minced garlic, and tajin seasoning. The last one is optional but I love it in this dressing and even add a little more sprinkled over each serving.\n\n![sweet potato quinoa salad in two bowls with lime wedges](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-4.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHelpful Tips!\n-------------\n\n*   I love this salad with slightly warm quinoa and warm roasted potatoes but it is absolutely delicious chilled in the fridge and can be divided into serving containers.\n*   If using fresh corn, add it to roasting potatoes. It will give it an even more delicious flavor.\n*   If you don't like raw red onion, skip it. Use a sweet one, if you prefer.\n*   To make the salad ahead, you can keep the dressing separate in a bottle and toss it with all the ingredients before serving.\n\nMore salad recipes:\n-------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Black Bean Taco Salad Recipe\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/black-bean-taco-salad-recipe/)\n*   [\n    \n    Chickpea Quinoa Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/chickpea-quinoa-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Fresh Corn Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/fresh-corn-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Easy Broccoli Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/quick-and-easy-broccoli-salad-recipe/)\n\n[![](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pin-it-button.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/59883870031914544/)\n\n__If you like this recipe and make it,_ **_let me know in the comments_** _below!

[This is olive oil](https://amzn.to/3hwcVGc) is generally considered the gold standard for affordable but excellent.  \n**Parmesan:** Freshly grated parmesan is preferred here because it melts and browns extremely nicely, but the bagged pre-shredded stuff works just fine.  \n**Salt & pepper:** You don’t really need more seasoning than a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, but if you’d like to experiment with flavors, try adding a little garlic powder or Italian seasoning.\n\n![Parmesan being sprinkled on zucchini slices before baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo.jpg)\n\nHow to Make the Best Baked Parmesan Zucchini (Tips and Tricks)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Be strategic about how you slice your zucchini:** Prefer softer zucchini? Slice it into thinner rounds, around 1/4-inch thick. Like your baked zucchini on the firmer side? Cut it thicker, closer to 1/2-inch.  \n**Don’t skip the broiler:** The final step in this recipe after roasting your zucchini is to switch on the broiler and broil the rounds for just a couple minutes. This makes the cheese extra toasty and delicious. But keep a close eye on your zucchini while the broiler is going. Food under the broiler can burn very quickly, so you never want to leave your broiler unattended.\n\n![Collage photo of parmesan zucchini before and after baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-picture.jpg)\n\n### What to Serve With Cheesy Roasted Zucchini?\n\nThese bites are great alongside almost anything, particularly simple lunch sandwiches or:\n\n*   [Tomato Soup](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-tomato-soup-recipe-for-two/)\n*   [Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwiches](https://bakingmischief.com/pesto-grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Sausage Pasta](https://bakingmischief.com/creamy-sausage-pasta/)\n*   [Buttered Noodles](https://bakingmischief.com/buttered-noodles/)\n\n**Bonus Tip:** _If you have leftover [Pizza Sauce](https://bakingmischief.com/best-homemade-pizza-sauce/) or marinara sauce in your fridge, serve these as a snack and use them for dipping.

The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.\n\n* * *\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nYield:4 servings\n\n*   1pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)\n*   1lemon\n*   4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n*   Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper\n*   ½teaspoon red-pepper flakes\n*   1(18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi\n*   6tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces\n*   ½teaspoon honey\n*   Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving\n\n[Ingredient Substitution Guide](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/79-substitutions-for-cooking)\n\n##### Nutritional analysis per serving (4 servings)\n\n526 calories; 33 grams fat; 13 grams saturated fat; 0 grams trans fat; 15 grams monounsaturated fat; 2 grams polyunsaturated fat; 52 grams carbohydrates; 8 grams dietary fiber; 5 grams sugars; 11 grams protein; 697 milligrams sodium\n\nNote: The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)\n    \n2.  In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.\n    \n3.  In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.\n    \n\nRatings\n-------\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\nor to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\n### Private Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n-------------\n\nDear NY Times stylist, thanks for using my father's, Michael Lax's, teak handled, cast iron, skillet, the large one, by Copco. Great skillets, but note, if you find one, due to the selection of the teak handle, you cannot put them into the oven. My father was an industrial designer and designed/started Copco. The NYTimes ran his obituary in 1999. He was a diehard New Yorker, born and raised in the west village on Morton Street and he went to Alfred University in the Industrial Ceramics dept.\n\nRather than honey, I substituted a splash of aged balsamic for sweetness as well as a touch of acidity.\n\nThis works great with the Trader Joe’s Cauliflower Gnocchi too.\n\nThis was so good! We roasted the brussel sprouts to make them really crispy and then added them to the skillet along with a shallot and chopped garlic after crisping the gnocchi. Also topped it with a dollop of lemon zested garlic ricotta to finish. It was over the top delicious!\n\nI guess I'm the only whose brussel sprouts didn't cook in five minutes. I tried to follow this using the timing but ended up with hard brussel sprouts so I had to add liquid and let it simmer\n\nFabulous! Life required that I roast the sprouts. I prepared as directed with lemon zest and red pepper flakes. My helper popped them in oven at 425. They cooked for 25 minutes to perfection. By time I got home, I had enough time to prepare gnocchi as directed before roasting was complete.. I had to make 2 batches for crowd I was feeding - first one used 6 T butter, second batch 4T. Four was plenty. Used balsamic instead of honey. Will make again and again !\n\nI have done this with pancetta rather than butter. It's fantastic, and it also would be almost as good with butter..\n\nMade this into a true 20 min meal by baking the Brussels sprouts in the oven (15 min at 450 degrees) while simultaneously cooking the gnocchi on the stove top. Mixed them together on stovetop at the very end as recipe says. Also, 6 tablespoons of butter seems crazy - I added 2 and my gnocchi were deliciously buttery and crispy! Quick and easy, would definitely make again.\n\nMy kids only dabbled in the brussels sprouts (understandable, and: more veggies for me!), but mainly stuck to the gnocchi. My wife - hates \"cabbage-y\" things - was astonished by how good it was. In my family, this counts as a success. However: - This took much more than 20 minutes, more like 40. - I rounded up on the portions (I live in Europe and buy in grams). Nonetheless, there weren't any leftovers. Feeds four? Feeds two adults and two toddlers. Well.\n\nIf the gnocchi immediately sticking to the pan like glue freaks you out like it did me the first time, don’t worry. It will release once the butter melts (and with a nice golden brown crust). Do make sure they are completely broken up before they go into the pan though.\n\nFollowed exactly, except my sprouts were big so I quartered them. It took more than 2 min for the butter to brown but once it did, magic. Don’t skimp on the lemon zest and don’t be afraid of some bigger chunks of it after chopping — fried in the butter and honey they are a delightful contrast to the rest of the dish. Don’t overdo the Parmesan at the end, a light sprinkle does the job.\n\nWhy decide between Pancetta and Butter when you can have both?!? One of the best things I’ve cooked at home in recent memory.\n\nCooked this last night and it was delicious. Next time I would double the Brussels sprouts and roast them instead of frying (my pan isn't big enough to properly fry that many sprouts!), try reducing the amount of butter by half (there was so much butter pooled at the bottom of my bowl when we finished it off!), then add the roasted sprouts into the pan to toss with the gnocchi at the very end. We didn't add the Parm because I was lazy and didn't bring it to the table, and didn't miss it one bit!\n\nI think some aged balsamic might be a good substitute for the honey.\n\nWe loved this one! I think the secret is a cast-iron skillet. This was the first recipe I’ve ever attempted in my cast-iron, and I am now a believer! I would probably throw in some bacon next time. And a handful of toasted pinenuts.\n\nLove this recipe! I did sub the honey and red pepper flakes with Mike's Hot Honey and added some rotisserie chicken to the mix.\n\nUsed pancetta (why not?) and was somehow lacking lemon, so used orange zest instead, which was honestly fantastic. What a lovely, tasty one skillet meal.\n\nThis is one of our absolute favorites! I use Brussels Sprouts and cut down the butter a bit. A regular in our house and often doubled (even for only 2 people) to have plenty of leftovers.\n\nDidn’t expect this to work so well but it was superb - like others, perhaps doesn’t need quite that much butter… Brussels Sprouts in a fry pan - awesome trick… Gnocchi in a frypan - awesome trick…. Put them together - amazing meal!\n\nI used chickpea gnocchi for added protein- A delicious dish!\n\nOven roasted the sprouts Halved the butter Added drizzle of lemon juice to the gnocchi at the end\n\nI think I messed this up. It was delicious but messy and super gooey. The brussel sprouts were fantastic but the gnocchi were gooey. Maybe I got the wrong kind? Definitely would try again and see about adding less butter. I was left with lots of extra butter in the pan. I also added mushrooms cause I love them but they probably added extra liquid.\n\nDelicious! For those saying the brussels don’t cook, cover them first while they’re browning. We added a bit of pancetta since we had it and needed to use it up. And why not. Just cooked that first then added the brussels and carried on. Decrease the salt if you do this. We also added more red pepper since we like it. This was absolutely amazing. Half way through eating, we decided to also squeeze some lemon on some of it, and it really gave a nice lift. Make this!\n\nI'm obsessed with this recipe! Sometimes I substitute tteok (Korean rice cakes) for the gnocchi and it takes it to a whole different level.\n\nI added hot Italian sausage and nixed the lemon zest. Hot honey and a drizzle of balsamic glaze at the end and it was absolutely delicious! The timing definitely took a bit longer than what the recipe suggests, but definitely worth it!\n\nLove it, we have made this 50+ times with the following changes: 1. Roast sprouts @ 425F. The listed method is not enough time to cook all the way thru. Add them after browning butter. Protip: Preheat your baking pan! They should sizzle on contact 2. Use 4-5 tbsp butter instead of 6 3. Add 2-3 cloves minced garlic 1 min from done 4. Sub honey for hot honey\n\nThis has become a staple in our house. We have made it over 50 times at this point. But we have evolved the recipe into our own so here are my recommendations: 1. Roast your brussels sprouts cut side down @ 425F instead of sautéing. The listed method is not enough time to cook all them all the way through. Toss them in after you brown the butter. Protip: preheat your baking pan, sprouts should sizzle immediately on contact 2. Let the gnocchi get browned on all sides 3. Add a couple cloves of min\n\nVery surprised by all the positive reviews. Both dry (notice lack of any sauce other than…butter) and extremely greasy (see previous note re: butter). If I try again might boil the gnocchi prior to frying to see if it adds some moisture, halve the butter, and double the ratio of Brussels to gnocchi.\n\nThis dish had no right to be as delicious as it was! The ingredients are simple and so are the techniques you use. It doesn't all make sense on paper but it comes together wonderfully! Crunchy gnocchi and brussel sprouts. Slightly hot from the red pepper flakes, a little sweet from the honey, and with the slightest hint of lemon. And the parmesan at the end! So subtle but so good! Definitely making this again and can't wait to try with the different variations of cruciferous vegetables!\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you."

Taking cues from Chipotle’s burrito bowl, we like to pile everything up high making for one delicious prep ahead meal!\n\nCategories\n----------\n\n![chicken fajita burrito bowl topped with bell peppers, guacamole and fresh salsa](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/Chicken-Fajita-Bowl-6.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599771028&s=c388f440ce366dcf8c5756c30af50e59)\n\nYou Asked for More Bowls, and We Are Giving Them to You.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBowls are all the rage right? [Rice bowls](https://themodernproper.com/chicken-teriyaki-sushi-bowl), [quinoa bowls](https://themodernproper.com/quinoa-bowl), [Buddha bowls](https://themodernproper.com/green-curry-buddha-bowl), burrito Bowls. Give us all the bowls! This chicken fajita bowl is one of our go-to weeknight meals. It’s healthy, easy, and balanced. Plus, it’s always a hit with the kids. A fajita burrito bowl might sound complicated, but they’re super simple. Season some chicken with [Homemade Taco Seasoning](https://themodernproper.com/homemade-taco-seasoning)—add some black beans, roasted bell peppers and all the fixings and serve over [Brown Rice](https://themodernproper.com/brown-rice) or [Cilantro Lime Rice](https://themodernproper.com/cilantro-lime-rice). Plus, it’s an ideal meal for all of you superhero meal-planners! Prep the ingredients a few days ahead, and you’ve got a customizable, buildable meal ready to go.

But we always load our chicken fajita burrito bowl with:\n\n*   [Brown rice](https://themodernproper.com/brown-rice)\n*   Black beans\n*   [Fajita chicken and peppers](https://themodernproper.com/sheet-pan-chicken-fajitas)\n*   Cilantro\n*   [Pico de Gallo](https://themodernproper.com/pico-de-gallo-with-cabbage) (or store-bought salsa, in a pinch!)\n*   [Guacamole](https://themodernproper.com/perfect-guacamole)\n*   Sour cream\n\n![a glass bowl with chicken and bell peppers marinated in taco seasoning](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/sheet-pan-chicken-fajita-1.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599767859&s=d1deab573364b317d468fcfa2afd53d0)\n\nPrep-Ahead Fajita Bowls\n-----------------------\n\nTaking cues from Chipotle’s burrito bowl, we like to pile everything up high, and (also just like Chipotle) we prefer to prep the ingredients ahead of time, so that when dinner time comes, everyone can just assemble and EAT! The taco-spiced chicken breast can be easily made ahead and is an incredibly easy recipe. After that, you just need to prep all your other ingredients and store them in small containers, so they’re ready as can be!  \n\n![Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas with lime juice, olive oil and taco seasoning.](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/sheet-pan-chicken-fajita-3.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1611952149&s=51ba70128e22bcaceb263b5f662a8dc1)\n\nAre Burrito Bowls Healthy?\n--------------------------\n\nYou betcha! We build this burrito bowl on a brown rice base, so it has a healthy start. But, if you’re trying to eat fewer carbs, a big pile of shredded romaine makes for a delicious base in place of the rice. Adding a little extra salsa and lime juice to your bowl will give it a sort of “dressing”. Once you’ve chosen your base add the proteins (chicken and beans), veggies, and healthy fats (I see you guacamole!) and you’ve got yourself a delicious, balanced dinner.  \n\n![hands holding a chicken fajita burrito bowl with black beans and guacamole](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/Chicken-Fajita-Bowl-2.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599771030&s=3df69e89de21010a4a1336ed64430b5c)\n\n![close up of chicken fajita burrito bowl](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/Chicken-Fajita-Bowl-7.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599766735&s=bfc72999c4336e1e1fb0e4c6beba3d55)\n\nTools You Will Need:\n--------------------\n\n*   [Sharp knife](https://amzn.to/2xwfTZJ) for prepping.\n*   [Large bowl](https://amzn.to/2XzNLQ3) to marinade your veggies and chicken in.\n*   [Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/2xt9f6w).

Seared chicken, fresh mozzarella and tomato halves, creamy avocado slices and shredded basil leaves are drizzled with an incredible balsamic **dressing that doubles as a marinade** for the ultimate salad!\n\nBalsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad… Now THIS was and still is a family favourite!\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-301.jpg)\n\nWith so many Caprese recipes making their way onto Cafe Delites, like our [Caprese Grilled Cheese](https://cafedelites.com/caprese-grilled-cheese/) and [Grilled Chicken Cypress with Buffalo Mozzarella](https://cafedelites.com/grilled-chicken-caprese/), this salad has been a long time coming. My list of recipes is getting so out of control, I’ve made the extremely difficult decision to STAHP adding to it, and actually start COOKING from it. Best. Decision. Ever. And I have a feeling this salad is going to be your next favourite. Because who doesn’t love Balsamic Chicken AND Caprese _in the one sentence?_\n\n### How To Make The Best Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad\n\nTraditionally, Caprese salads do not contain any balsamic vinegar OR avocados or chicken, but today, however, that has changed to make way for this bowl of epic flavours.\n\nTaking some inspiration from this [Balsamic Glazed Caprese Chicken](https://cafedelites.com/balsamic-glazed-caprese-chicken-recipe/), you’re first going to marinade your chicken:\n\n*   You only need to use 4 tablespoons of the balsamic marinade.\n*   You’re going to reserve the **remaining dressing to use later in the refrigerator!** _No_, we don’t use the OLD marinade as a dressing. We use the _FRESH UNTOUCHED_ marinade.\n*   Then, you’re going to sear said chicken until crispy on the edges and golden. For this salad I used boneless, skinless thighs, BUT you can use breasts if you wish.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nAfter that, the salad comes together _so FAST_. Throw all ingredients into a bowl and dress with the reserved dressing.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-16.jpg)\n\nJuicy, golden balsamic chicken………fresh grape or cherry tomatoes……fresh baby mozzarella balls (or bocconcini).\n\n### Substitutions\n\n*   You can use cherry tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes, or use chopped Roma tomatoes.\n*   Fresh mozzarella balls are best in this. You can use any size if you can’t find mini.\n*   Romaine, butter, ice berg or spinach are all fine to use as the base.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-20.jpg)![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-19.jpg)\n\nSay hello to your new favourite salad.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-21.jpg)\n\nIf you love this salad, you’ll love this [BLT Balsamic Chicken Avocado & Feta Salad](https://cafedelites.com/blt-balsamic-chicken-avocado-feta-salad/) OR this [Grilled Lemon Herb Mediterranean Chicken Salad](https://cafedelites.com/grilled-lemon-herb-mediterranean-chicken-salad-recipe/)!\n\n#### WATCH THIS Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad BEING MADE RIGHT HERE!\n\n  \n\n![](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-301-1-200x200.jpg)\n\n### Marinade/Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup (60 mL) balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons (30 mL) olive oil\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons brown sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon minced garlic\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon dried basil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon salt\n\n### Salad:\n\n*   ▢ 4 chicken thigh fillets, skin removed (no bone)\\*\n*   ▢ 5 cups Romaine, (or cos) lettuce leaves, washed and dried\n*   ▢ 1 avocado, sliced\n*   ▢ 1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced\n*   ▢ ½ cup mini mozzarella / bocconcini cheese balls\n*   ▢ ¼ cup basil leaves, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper, to season\n\n*   Whisk marinade ingredients together to combine.

To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled

roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-e1541953605651.jpg)\n\nUsing your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame.\n\nLightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce remove excess dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-e1541953690862.jpg)\n\nLift your tray and carefully turn upside down on a parchment paper lined baking tray. \n\nThe pumpkin ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. \n\nCollect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of pumpkin raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n\nAdd your fresh pumpkin ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. \n\nsage butter, apples and pecans\n------------------------------\n\nWhile your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat.  You want to stir them often or they will burn. \n\nCook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant.  Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside.\n\nNext, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat.  Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce apples and butter](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-e1541953820985.jpg)\n\nThen add your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 – 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry.\n\nOnce your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumpkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat.  Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n\n**pro tips for perfect pumpkin ravioli**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don’t want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don’t forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can’t emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don’t!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 – 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn’t seem like much but you don’t want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce bowl](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-e1541953937768.jpg)\n\n**can you make ravioli without a pasta machine?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely!

You’ve got it! Here are a few ideas to get your started.\n\n*   **Spicy Kick**: For those who like a bit of heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a drizzle of chili oil over the roasted carrots before serving.\n*   **Vegan Twist**: Swap the goat cheese for vegan feta or cashew-based cheese. For the candied pecans, use coconut oil instead of butter.\n*   **Nut Alternatives**: If pecans aren’t your thing or you’re just looking to mix things up, try candied walnuts or almonds instead.\n*   **Roasted Veggie Medley**: Introduce other root veggies to the party. Parsnips, beets, or sweet potatoes can be roasted alongside the carrots for a vibrant and varied dish.\n*   **Citrusy Fresh**: Add a zesty twist with a sprinkle of orange or lemon zest over the roasted carrots. The citrus notes can provide a refreshing contrast to the sweet and savory components.\n*   **Cheese Variations**: If goat cheese isn’t up your alley, try shaved Parmesan, crumbled feta, or even chunks of creamy brie. Each cheese brings its own unique flavor to the dish.\n\n![gold tongs taking a serving of roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese. ](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Glazed-Carrots-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-recipe-756x1024.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Can I use baby carrots instead of regular carrots?\n\nTotally! Baby carrots are a great substitute. They might roast a tad quicker, so just keep an eye on them. That golden-brown caramelization is what we’re aiming for!\n\n### I’m out of maple syrup, any alternatives?\n\nNo sweat, friend! Honey works wonders as a substitute. You could also use agave nectar or even a touch of molasses for a deeper flavor.\n\n### Not a fan of goat cheese, what else can I use?\n\nThat’s the beauty of cooking – make it your own! Feta cheese or even blue cheese can offer a similar tangy kick. Or if you prefer something creamier, a sprinkle of fresh Parmesan or ricotta could be delish!\n\n### How long do these roasted carrots keep?\n\nThese babies taste best straight out of the oven. But if you do have leftovers, pop them in an airtight container and refrigerate. They’ll be good for 2-3 days. Just give them a little reheat before serving!\n\n### Can I prep the candied pecans ahead of time?\n\nAbsolutely! Make those pecans in advance and store them in an airtight container at room temperature. It’s a lifesaver, especially if you’re prepping for a big meal or gathering.\n\n### What other herbs can I use besides thyme?\n\n  \nRosemary is a great alternative with its aromatic and woody essence. Or even a sprinkle of parsley for some fresh vibes. Don’t be afraid to play around and find what tingles your taste buds!\n\nAs you have probably noticed, something sweet can be a nice complement to a savory meal. This is why people often serve something like candied yams or sweet butternut squash at Thanksgiving.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dish that’s a bit different, give these carrots a try. They are simple to make, and the flavor combination is on point.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\n![fork taking a bite of roasted carrots with candied pecans and goat cheese.](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Roasted-Carrots-Candied-Pecans-and-Goat-Cheese-662x1024.jpg)\n\nMore Holiday Side You’ll Love\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Mashed Butternut Squash](https://inspiredbycharm.com/mashed-butternut-squash/)\n*   [Waldorf Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/waldorf-salad/)\n*   [Roasted Brussels Spouts Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/roasted-balsamic-brussels-sprouts/)\n*   [Cheesy Cauliflower Gratin](https://inspiredbycharm.com/cheesy-cauliflower-gratin/)\n*   [Broccolini Salad](https://inspiredbycharm.com/broccolini-salad/)\n\nI truly hope you give these roasted carrots a try – they’re a game-changer.

We all know that around here, I like to keep Mondays fun, different, and delicious. Trust me when I say, this apple Panini fits the bill. I’m even going to go out and say that if you make this today, you’re going to have a pretty darn good (err delicious?) Monday.\n\nLet me explain, its real simple…\n\n_buttered sourdough bread_…I mean, that right there is close to perfection.\n\n_apple butter_…I used a homemade apple butter that I’ll be sharing with you all very soon, it _makes_ this Panini.\n\n_sharp cheddar cheese_…honeycrisp apple’s best friend.\n\n_buttery havarti cheese_…for its buttery flavor and major “melt” factor.\n\n_honeycrisp apples_…my very favorite apple variety.\n\ncrispy bacon…its salty, savory flavors are the perfect balance in this sweet Panini.\n\nhoney…to add just one more layer of deliciousness.\n\nfresh thyme…my current favorite herb and a favorite pairing with apples and cheddar.\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-2.jpg)\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-3.jpg)\n\nYou see? SO GOOD.\n\nI am pretty excited that the month of all things apples is finally here. To me, September is all about apples, I like to save the pumpkins for October and November. Every September I always have a million and one apple recipes I want to share with you guys, and this year is no different.\n\nI’m happy to be sharing this Panini as my very first apple recipe of the season. And while I have many more to come, this sandwich is near the top of my list of the most crave worthy, comforting, and cozy recipes.\n\nAs mentioned above, this Panini (or grilled cheese, it’s really whatever you’d like to call it) is pretty simple. You’re going to butter some bread, layer it with apple butter, cheese, fresh apples, bacon, honey, and a sprinkle of fresh thyme (lemon thyme is my favorite) and then press everything together in a Panini press ([this is my favorite](http://rstyle.me/n/cr7gdwb9wzf)). If you don’t have a Panini press, just make it on the stove top. No matter what, it’s going to be freaking-a-mazing.\n\nIt’s sweet, salty, and extra cheesy. Slice the apples thin so that they soften up while cooking and then as soon as the sandwich comes out of the Panini press, drizzle it with a touch more of honey and a sprinkle of fresh thyme. No debating this step, you just have to do it. It might not seem all that necessary, but I promise you, it’s what makes this sandwich so extra special…okay and it’s kind of a signature HBH step.\n\nDO IT.\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-4.jpg)\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-5.jpg)\n\nSpeaking of doing things, let’s go over some weekend stuff. We had some serious fall like weather int the late afternoons here, and the leaves have definitely started to turn. Autumn happens so fast up here in the mountains. The leaves are almost all off the trees by the second week of October. So you see, FAST.\n\nSince it’s was kind of chilly and cloudy later in the day on Sunday (summer mornings in the mountains are often sunny, then later in the day the clouds move in ), I decided to make a big pot of [chili](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/crockpot-beef-chili/). Along with my favorite beer bread from the [HBH cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553496395?tag=randohouseinc7986-20) (did you catch the video of this recipe on Instagram?!). While the chili slowly simmered on the stove, I did some serious online shopping damage.\n\nAhhhh. YIKES.\n\nI am not a good in store shopper, but give me a blanket and a computer and I can do some serious damage. I was shopping for both clothes and barn items for the upcoming [HBH retreat](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/half-baked-harvest-cookbook-colorado-retreat-giveaway/) here in Colorado at the end of the month. I am in need a few outfits and things for around my house. I found lots, and while I have some cute things on the way, I may have gone just a smidge overboard. What?! Like you’ve never done that before…\n\nAll I have to say is that online shopping is both amazing and scary. My finger tips love it, my credit card…not so much!\n\nAlso, I am still looking for few home items if you guys have suggestions of cute places to look. Let me know your favorite shops! I will be sharing everything I bought in this week’s Nine Favorite Things, so if interested, stay tuned!\n\nIn the meantime, I think we all know how our Monday needs to end.\n\nPick up some apples, cheese, and bread from the store, head home and make this Panini…\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-6.jpg)\n\nPrep Time 10 minutes\n\nCook Time 10 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings: 4 servings\n\nCalories Per Serving: 710 kcal\n\nNutritional information is only an estimate.

I always love watching my friends and family take a bite for the first time. It is one of those recipes where people close their eyes and say: wow, yum, mmmm, so good, amazing, and some even make weird noises, which is kind of awkward at a party, but this crostini is THAT good!

Your guests will LOVE it! \")\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to Cincinnati for a blogging event with [Kroger](https://www.kroger.com/). We have been working with Kroger this year so it was fun to see the headquarters, meet with the Kroger team, and spend time with the other Kroger bloggers.\n\nKroger asked every blogger to prepare a recipe for a holiday meal. We all shopped, cooked, and ate together and it was so much fun. We used the new [ClickList](https://www.kroger.com/onlineshopping/signin?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kroger.com%2Fstorecatalog%2Fservlet%2FOnlineShoppingStoreSetup) program to do our grocery shopping.

It only takes 15 minutes to make! \")\n\nFor the holiday meal, I made my favorite Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini. I knew it would be a hit with the group!\n\nSo let’s talk about how easy this recipe is. I told you easy and I mean EASY. The appetizer starts with a baguette, but I don’t even have to slice it because I always buy the perfectly sliced baguette at Kroger (Smith’s in Utah). Next, I spread apple butter on the bread slices. I don’t make the apple butter, I totally cheat and use Private Selection Apple Butter. It is perfectly spiced and tastes amazing.\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-5.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! \")\n\nOn top of the apple butter, I place slices of creamy [Murray’s Cheese Brie](http://www.murrayscheese.com/). I place the crostini in the oven until the brie gets all melty and gooey. Remove from the oven and top with candied pecans and a drizzle of honey. At home, I use my homemade [candied pecans](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/candied-pecans/) because I always have them on hand, but at the event I used Private Selections candied pecans and they are really tasty! Kroger really does have everything!\n\nAt the event, I also tried Private Selection’s Vanilla and Nutmeg Infused Honey and oh my goodness! It was the perfect ending to my crostini. If you can’t find it, any honey will do, but that honey is amazing!\n\nThe Brie, Apple, and Honey was the perfect start to our holiday feast! Everyone loved it. And let me tell you, when a group of bloggers makes a holiday meal, you leave very full and very happy. I was amazed by all of the creative and delicious dishes. I wish we could make dinner together every night!\n\nThis easy Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini is the perfect holiday appetizer. It takes about 15 minutes to make and your guests will be raving about it until the next holiday season.

Log in here.\n\nIt’s an easy recipe that cooks in **one pan**, but the moment you take a bite, you will want to hire yourself to be head chef in an Italian restaurant.\n\nI’ve become more confident in the kitchen over the years and feel like I more or less know what to expect when I approach a recipe.\n\nEvery now and then, however, a recipe will catch me off guard in a very _very_ good way.\n\nThis Italian sausage butternut squash gnocchi is one of those recipes.\n\nI mean, I didn’t think it was going to be _bad_ by any means.\n\nButternut squash (my fave fall veg), Italian sausage (all things good), and gnocchi (pure comfort food) are all involved.\n\nAdd some butter and a handful of Parmesan cheese, and you have a dinner dream team.\n\nI was not, however, expecting this simple sausage and vegetable gnocchi to blow me away like it did.\n\nI took a bite and had to pause to ask myself if I had really made it.\n\nI suppose we are all allowed to blow ourselves away in the kitchen every now and then, but my goal has always been for _other_ people to feel that way about a recipe.\n\nThis Italian sausage and butternut squash gnocchi made **me** feel that way about myself.\n\nIt was a cool sensation, and I can’t wait for you to try this recipe and experience it too!\n\n![One pan butternut squash gnocchi on a plate](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Italian-Sausage-Butternut-Squash-Gnocchi-1.jpg)\n\n5 Star Review\n-------------\n\n> “Your description is spot on, I tasted this after making it and was blown away! It is so easy, so unique and everyone in the house loved it. This dish is truly gourmet!”\n> \n> — Sarah —\n\nHow to Make Butternut Squash Gnocchi\n------------------------------------\n\nCulinary rock star feelings aside, this is a delicious meal that is so easy to make, it almost feels like cheating.\n\n*   The entire recipe cooks in one skillet, _including_ the gnocchi.\n*   Since it’s packed with both lean protein and veggies, it works as an all-in-one meal, no extra sides required (just like with this [Cauliflower Pasta](https://www.wellplated.com/cauliflower-pasta/) and [Sweet Potato Pasta](https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-potato-pasta/)).\n*   It tastes like fall comfort on a plate and had me convinced for a moment that I was back in Italy.\n\n* * *\n\n### **The Ingredients**\n\n*   **Gnocchi**. Delightful, pillowy-soft potato gnocchi is a true crowd-pleaser. It pairs perfectly with the Italian sausage and butternut squash. Want to try your hand at homemade gnocchi? Try my [Sweet Potato Gnocchi](https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-potato-gnocchi/).\n*   **Italian Turkey Sausage**. For a boost of protein and even more comforting flavor, this recipe also includes Italian sausage. I use chicken or turkey sausage 99% of the time. It’s leaner than pork sausage but still delivers on flavor. Pinky promise, you won’t notice the swap.\n\nTip!\n----\n\n*   **Butternut Squash**. Sweet, flavorful, and nutritious. Butternut squash is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\n*   **Spinach**. For an extra boost of nutrition. Spinach is rich in fiber and vitamins.\n*   **Butter**. Since this recipe obtains its soul-satisfying flavor from only a few ingredients, make sure you use a good-quality butter. It makes a world of difference!\n*   **Sage**. For quintessential fall flavor.\n*   **Nutmeg**. Adds an irressitable warmth and coziness to the dish. Plus, it tastes fantastic with the butternut squash!\n*   **Parmesan**. The perfect finishing touch!\n\n### The Directions\n\n1.  Brown the sausage and remove to a plate.\n2.  Sauté the squash and onion with the garlic, sage, and spices.\n3.  Add the chicken broth and gnocchi. Stir in the sausage and spinach. Top with Parmesan. DIG IN!\n\nDietary Note\n------------\n\n*   **To Make Vegan**. If you need this to be a vegan butternut squash gnocchi recipe, you can swap the butter for vegan butter, vegetable broth for the chicken broth, omit the Italian sausage, and use a vegan Parmesan substitute.\n*   **To Make Gluten Free**. For gluten-free butternut squash gnocchi, select a gluten-free gnocchi option. Note that you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\n![Potato pasta, ground meat, and veggies in a pot](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sausage-Butternut-Squash-Gnocchi-1.jpg)\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   **To Store**. Refrigerate leftover gnocchi in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days. \n*   **To Reheat**. Rewarm gently in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of extra chicken broth or water to keep it from drying out.\n*   **To Freeze**. Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating. \n\nMeal Prep Tip\n-------------\n\nBrown the sausage up to 1 day in advance. Refrigerate it in an airtight storage container.\n\nWhat to Serve with Butternut Squash Gnocchi\n-------------------------------------------\n\n![Italian sausage butternut squash gnocchi in a Dutch oven](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Italian-Sausage-Gnocchi-with-Butternut-Squash-Spinach-1.jpg)\n\n*   **[Dutch Oven](https://amzn.to/2R0QluK)**.

The ideal tool for cutting the butternut squash.\n\nI am so excited for you to try this butternut squash gnocchi recipe! If you do give it a go, please let me know how it turned out in the comments section below.\n\nHearing from you makes my day even more than a second helping of this gnocchi did (and you know how strongly I feel about it by now?).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**What is Gnocchi?**\n\nGnocchi is a soft, pillowy, Italian-style dumpling that’s made from potatoes. It’s typically eaten like pasta with a sauce.\n\nFor this recipe, I recommend using premade, shelf-stable gnocchi, which you can find near the pasta in your grocery store.\n\n**Can I Use a Different Type of Italian Sausage?**\n\nI prefer to use Italian turkey or chicken sausage because they have less fat. However, you can certainly use Italian pork sausage if you prefer.\n\n**Can I Use Pre-Cut Butternut Squash Cubes?**\n\nYes, you can cut a butternut squash yourself or use pre-cut butternut squash cubes. Depending upon the size they are cut, you may need to adjust the saute time accordingly.\n\nemail me the recipe!\n--------------------\n\nEnter your email below to save this recipe to your free Well Plated recipe box.\n\nFrom time to time, we’ll send you the best of Well Plated.

Right: Clean acorn squash.](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sausage-Stuffed-Acorn-Squash-2.png)\n\n**Roast the acorn squash:**\n\n*   Coat the acorn squash with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\n*   Place on a baking sheet, skin side down, and bake for 50-60 minutes until they’re fork tender. The roasting time will vary depending on the size of your acorn squash.\n\n![Left: Seasoned acorn squash on a baking sheet. Right: Roasted acorn squash. ](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sausage-Stuffed-Acorn-Squash-1.png)\n\n**Cook the sausage and aromatics:**\n\n*   While the squash cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.\n*   Add the sausage and cook for 5-6 minutes until brown. As it cooks, use a wooden spoon to break apart any large pieces. \n*   Remove the sausage from the pan and set it aside, leaving the fat in the skillet.\n*   Add the onions and bell pepper to the same skillet and cook for 3-5 minutes until they’re soft. Then, add garlic and cook for 30 seconds.\n\n![Left: Sausage cooking in a skillet.

Season with salt and pepper and cook for 1 minute.\n*   Add the chopped kale and cranberry and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n*   Return the sausage to the skillet and stir well to combine.

A serving size is one-half of an acorn squash per person.\n*   When you’re roasting acorn squash, look for a little caramelization around the edges. This is an easy way to add extra flavor.\n*   In this sausage and apple stuffed acorn squash recipe, I use nitrate-free sausage, which is better for you.\n\n*   **To Store**: Once your leftover acorn squash has cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n*   **To Reheat**: Reheat in a microwave or in the oven at 350°F until heated through.\n\n*   **Tender chicken or pork**: This dish is a full meal on its own, but it also pairs wonderfully with my [grilled chicken thighs](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/grilled-chicken-thighs/) or easy [oven pork chops](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/easy-oven-pork-chop-recipe/).\n*   **A seasonal salad**: A fresh, fall-inspired salad, like my [shaved Brussels sprouts salad](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprouts-salad/) is the perfect side dish to serve with sausage stuffed acorn squash.\n*   **Roasted vegetables**: Savory roasted vegetables, such as [roasted cauliflower](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/spicy-roasted-cauliflower-recipe/) or [cabbage steaks](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/cabbage-steak-recipe/) provide a nice balance to the sweetness in this recipe.\n\n*   **Add grains:** To make this dish even more satisfying, add a whole grain to the filling, such as [wild rice](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-wild-rice-recipe/) or [quinoa](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/how-to-make-fluffy-quinoa/).\n*   **Top with cheese:** A salty, melty cheese would be so yummy on top. Try a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese or crumbled goat cheese.\n*   **Switch up the squash:** Enjoy all the winter squash while it’s in season and make a variation of this recipe with your favorite squash variety such as delicata squash. See my [stuffed butternut squash with Italian sausage](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/italian-sausage-stuffed-butternut-squash/) recipe for inspiration!\n*   **Nut:** top this recipe with your favorite nut such as [pecans](https://amzn.to/47GYtFJ), [almonds](https://amzn.to/47D4GCH) or [walnut](https://amzn.to/416CC87).\n\n*   [Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3Ro9Hta): The squash is roasted on a standard 9×13 baking sheet.\n*   [Skillet](https://amzn.to/3R4pZFX): A large skillet is needed to cook the filling.\n*   [Knife](https://amzn.to/47Zsj8j): This recipe requires some chopping, so you’ll need a nice sharp knife.\n\n****How do I prepare acorn squash?****\n\nFirst, you’ll want to start with a good acorn squash. Look for one that is dark green in color, heavy for its size, and has no blemishes. Then, using a sharp knife, you’ll cut the squash in half between one of the ridges. Because of its shape, acorn squash is easier to cut if you place it on a towel to hold it steady. Next, you’ll remove the stem and scoop out the pulp and seeds. Now, your squash is ready to roast and fill with your favorite ingredients!\n\n****Can I eat the skin of an acorn squash?****\n\nYes, you can! After roasting acorn squash, the skin becomes soft and tender enough to cut with a fork. However, if you’d rather not eat the skin, you can easily separate it from everything else and just enjoy the inside of the acorn squash.\n\n****Could I use another vegetable instead of acorn squash?****\n\nYou can create endless variations of this recipe using different vegetables. You’ll want to choose vegetables that are sturdy enough to hold the stuffing when they’re cooked, like bell peppers, eggplant, or potatoes. Other varieties of squash like butternut squash or zucchini also work great.\n\nMore Delicious Squash Recipes\n-----------------------------\n\nWant more seasonal recipes?

Lightly grease the foil-lined baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.\n    \n*   Make sure Brussels sprouts have trimmed ends and yellow leaves are removed. Then, slice all Brussels sprouts in half. In a medium bowl, combine halved Brussels sprouts, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt (to taste), and toss to combine. Place onto a foil-lined baking sheet, cut side down, and roast in the oven at 400 F for about 20-25 minutes. During the last 5-10 minutes of roasting, turn them over for even browning, the cut sides should be nicely and partially charred but not blackened (see my photos).\n    \n\n#### Roasted butternut squash:\n\n*   Preheat oven to 400 F. Lightly grease the foil-lined baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.\n    \n*   In a medium bowl, combine cubed butternut squash (peeled and seeded),1 tablespoon of olive oil, maple syrup, and cinnamon, and toss to mix.\n    \n*   Place butternut squash in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning once half-way through baking, until softened.\n    \n*   **Note:**  You can roast both Brussels sprouts and butternut squash on 2 separate baking sheets at the same time, on the same rack in the oven – that’s what I did.\n    \n\n#### Assembly:\n\n*   In a large bowl, combine roasted Brussels sprouts, roasted butternut squash, pumpkin seeds, and cranberries, and mix to combine. (OPTIONAL): For more sweetness, add 2 or 4 tablespoons of maple syrup, if desired – do not add all maple syrup at once, start with 2 tablespoons, then add more, if desired, and toss with the salad ingredients to combine.\n    \n*   **Tip:** You can add a small amount of apricot jelly or jam (1 or 2 tablespoons) to the maple syrup (stir it together) prior to mixing the maple syrup with the veggies. This will thicken up the maple syrup and get it to stick to the veggies! \n    \n\n#### Looking for more Thanksgiving side dishes?\n\n*   I have created a comprehensive recipe collection of [60 Thanksgiving side dishes](https://juliasalbum.com/thanksgiving-side-dishes/) conveniently **categorized by ingredient**: Green Beans, Butternut Squash, Sweet Potatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Potatoes, Acorn Squash, Spaghetti Squash, Asparagus, Broccoli, etc. It's a great resource to browse through for a last moment holiday inspiration!

Please read our disclosure policy.\n\nOne of the great ironies of writing a food blog and [a cookbook](https://amzn.to/2SAd7JF) is that the nights I _think_ I’ll enjoy cooking the most—the ones when I’m not following or testing a recipe and thus can toss in a pinch of this and a handful of that without even (GASP!) measuring—end up being the ones I most _wish_ I’d documented our meal with my usual rigor.

Log in here.\n\nBen and I both loved this dish so much, my immediate reaction is to want to share it with you all here!\n\nThis easy chicken dinner is my favorite kind of meal and the way I cook most often: a one-pan dinner that offers both protein and veggies so I don’t need to cook a separate side.\n\nI also always make sure I add a few flavor boosters so that even though the ingredients are simple (ahem, whatever I could dig out of my fridge), the recipe tastes special, intentional, and like something that really could have come from a cookbook, instead of its actual source—my moderately sleep-deprived brain after a glass of Cabernet.\n\nWELL, perhaps I do some of my best work after a glass of red, because what started as a throw-it-all-in, see-what-happens stand-up dinner turned out to be a meal that we truly loved and that I was ecstatic to eat a second time.\n\n![Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet. An easy weeknight dinner that's ready in 30 minutes!](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Chicken-Sweet-Potato-Kale-Skillet-with-Cranberries-Goat-Cheese.jpg)\n\nAbout This Easy, Healthy Chicken Recipe\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe core base ingredients (the ones I found in my fridge) are:\n\n*   **Chicken**. Originally I made the recipe with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, but since I only have that in my refrigerator once a year, I updated today’s version to use cooked, shredded chicken instead. If you need an easy way to make it, check out my [How to Cook Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-shredded-chicken/) for my favorite easy, foolproof method. [Crock Pot Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/crock-pot-shredded-chicken/) and [Baked Chicken Breast](https://www.wellplated.com/baked-chicken-breast/) are also great.\n\nIn an ideal world, I cook my shredded chicken in advance, but if you follow my method above, you can start the chicken cooking when you begin the recipe and it will be ready by the time you need to add it to the skillet with the veggies.\n\nFor an even greater shortcut, you can try this recipe with shredded store-bought rotisserie chicken.\n\n*   **Sweet Potatoes**. I almost always have one or two of these sweet orange beauties in my pantry. They are a quick and healthy add to almost any fall or winter dinner.\n*   **Kale**. Sturdy kale is ideal for stir-fry and skillet-type recipes like this because it can hold up to the heat and other bold flavors. The amount called for will seem like a lot at first, but it will cook down significantly.\n\n![Healthy Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet made with cranberries and goat cheese. Easy and healthy chicken dinner!](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Easy-Chicken-Recipe-with-Kale-Sweet-Potatoes-Goat-Cheese.jpg)\n\nNext, the flavor boosters! Don’t miss these. They make the recipe.\n\n*   **Goat Cheese**. Crumbled goat cheese melts into the nooks and crannies, makes the recipe creamy, and gives the dish just enough indulgence to make it taste satisfying. I like to stir in half, then leave the rest to crumble on top so that I get delightful little pockets of it with every forkful.\n*   **Balsamic Vinegar**. When I was first cooking this dish, I tasted it at the end and felt it lacked a little pop. A splash of balsamic vinegar did the trick! It brightens up the ingredients and balances the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes.\n*   **Fresh Herbs**. Use any mix of sage, rosemary, and thyme, all of which seem to make their way in and out of my refrigerator this time of year. I really recommend fresh over dried (dried doesn’t have the same wonderful effect). Look for the poultry herb mix, which usually offers all three.\n*   **Dried Cranberries or Pomegranate**. I love adding a handful of these little jewels anytime I’m doing a fall-themed recipe. The first time I used pomegranate seeds because we happened to have some leftover. The second I used dried cranberries, because we always have them around and I wanted to see how the dish would taste with more of a pantry staple. Answer: both are delicious! Feel free to choose your favorite.\n\nPomegranates feel fancier; dried cranberries are easier and still taste great.\n\n![Easy Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet. Ready in 30 minutes for a weeknight winner!](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Easy-Healthy-Chicken-Recipe-with-Sweet-Potatoes.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with This Sweet Potato, Kale, and Chicken Dinner\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Rice**. This dish is yummy on its own, but I loved it most with a [brown and wild rice mix blend like this one](https://amzn.to/2UoNZ8A). If you’re looking to keep things low carb, try cauliflower rice.\n*   **Bread**. I also suspect this recipe would be delicious paired with thick slices of good-quality crusty bread.\n\n![Healthy chicken dinner recipe with sweet potatoes, kale, and cranberries.

Add the sweet potatoes, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften and turn golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.\n    \n*   Stir in the kale a few handfuls at a time, until it is all wilted and fits in the skillet (this may take a few minutes). Let cook, stirring very frequently, until the kale is tender, about 6 additional minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 additional minute.\n    \n*   Stir in the chicken. Next, stir in the balsamic vinegar, sage, thyme, and cranberries. Crumble half of the goat cheese over the top, then stir so that it melts and becomes creamy. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Sprinkle the remaining goat cheese over the top, then serve hot over rice.\n    \n\n*   \\*In place of [shredded chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-shredded-chicken/), you can also cube the uncooked chicken and saute it in about 1 tablespoon olive oil at the beginning of the recipe. Remove it from the skillet, proceed with the recipe starting at Step 1, then add the chicken at the end. You can also use [Instant Pot Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/instant-pot-chicken/), [Baked Chicken Breast](https://www.wellplated.com/baked-chicken-breast/), or [Crock Pot Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/crock-pot-shredded-chicken/).\n*   \\*\\*For the sage, rosemary, and/or thyme, I suggest buying the “Poultry Blend” fresh herb packet, as it contains all three. You can also use one or all three of the herbs, depending upon what you have leftover.\n\nServing: 1of 4, about 2 cups (without rice)Calories: 509kcalCarbohydrates: 35gProtein: 59gFat: 16gSaturated Fat: 7gCholesterol: 148mgFiber: 9gSugar: 12g\n\nJoin today and start saving your favorite recipes\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nCreate an account to easily save your favorite recipes and access FREE meal plans.\n\n[Sign Me Up](https://www.wellplated.com/register/)\n\nYou May Also Like\n-----------------\n\nBreakfast & Brunch\n\n### [Western Omelette](https://www.wellplated.com/western-omelette/)\n\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/61f966c91c7744e98d39995df9e6ce45?s=96&r=g)\n\nHi, I'm Erin Clarke, and I'm fearlessly dedicated to making healthy food that's affordable, easy-to-make, and best of all DELISH.

A perfect healthy Fall meal](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%201200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nWhat is the best way to prepare roasted butternut squash?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   First: make sure you **pick out a great butternut squash.** In the U.S., the best time to buy ripe local squash is September through October. Look for butternut squash with a solid beige color and one that feels heavy for its size.\n*   Preheat the oven to **400 degrees F** and begin to prepare the butternut squash.\n*   To prepare the butternut squash: slice off the stems at both ends and then peel the entire squash. Slice the squash in half where the thinner end begins to widen around the middle.\n*   Slice the thick end in half and with a sharp spoon, scoop out and remove the seeds (you can roast the seeds too for a fun snack!).\n*   Dice the squash into even 1-inch cubes — **the more even your pieces, the more perfectly the squash will roast!**\n*   Toss the squash on a large sheet pan with just **the right amount of olive oil** (I’ve found 4 cups to 2 tablespoons is perfect!), salt & pepper, and a few other spices. Make sure to **spread the squash into one even layer**. If the squash is crammed, it will end up steaming instead of roasting.\n*   Cook in the preheated oven and toss after 10 minutes to get an even roasting!\n\n ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%201200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nCan I meal prep with this roasted butternut squash couscous bowls?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Yes**!! You can prepare the couscous, roasted butternut squash, and dressing for 4 consecutive days.\n*   **To prepare for meal prep**: add cooked and cooled couscous and cooked and cooled roasted butternut squash into 4 equal meal prep containers. Divide the dressing equally among 4 smaller containers and place in each meal prep container. Place the pecans in reusable bags in each container. Each morning/afternoon before eating, add some fresh sliced avocado and fresh arugula (if desired). Toss everything with the dressing and enjoy!\n\nCan I add meat to these roasted butternut squash couscous bowls?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes! I’d recommend either **smoked turkey sausage** (roast in the oven or saute in a skillet) on the side OR serve with **grilled** **chicken**. This [grilled chicken marinade](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/grilled-chicken-marinade/) is our favorite!\n\n ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%201200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nWhat makes these roasted butternut squash couscous bowls healthy?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Roasted Butternut Squash**: butternut squash is a powerhouse ingredient! It’s got a ton of **potassium** which can help decrease blood pressure, it’s loaded with **vitamin** **A** which is super important for healthy eyesight, has a good amount of **vitamin** **C** which has been linked to healthier skin, and is linked to anti-inflammatory effects. In addition to the many benefits, it’s also low in calories and almost no fat (less than 100 calories with 26 carbohydrates in 1 cup).\n*   **Avocado**: although bananas are known for their potassium, did you know avocados have even more **potassium** in them?! They pack 14% of the recommended daily allowance of potassium while bananas are at 10%. There are lots of studies linking a high potassium intake to reduce blood pressure which correlates reduced risk of heart attacks, strokes, and/or kidney failure.\n*   **Pecans**: in just one ounce of pecans you’ll be getting 3 grams of **fiber**, 3 grams of **protein**, and 20 grams of mostly **unsaturated** **fats** (the healthy fats!) which makes these nuts satisfying and hearty with lots of benefits. Pecans provide phytonutrients which have powerful antioxidant benefits (antioxidants help to ward off disease/illness). Pecans are also packed with **vitamin** **E** which has been linked to lowering the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.\n\n ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%201223'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nSimilar Healthy (and Vegetarian) Meals:\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   [Sweet Potato Burrito Bowls](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/easy-sweet-potato-black-bean-burrito-bowls/)\n*   [Roasted Sweet Potato Pesto Couscous Bowls](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/pesto-couscous-bowls/)\n*   [Bruschetta Pasta](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/bruschetta-pasta/)\n*   [Crockpot Mexican Quinoa Tacos](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/crockpot-mexican-quinoa-tacos/)\n*   [Sweet Potato Enchiladas](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/sweet-potato-enchiladas/)\n\n*   ▢ 4 cups chopped butternut squash (~1 medium butternut squash)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon EACH: dried parsley, dried oregano\n*   ▢ Fine sea salt and freshly cracked pepper\n*   ▢ 1 cup couscous\n*   ▢ 1 cup vegetable stock (or broth), or chicken stock (not vegetarian)\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon butter\n*   ▢ 1-2 large ripe avocado(s), thinly sliced or chopped\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup honey roasted almonds or pecans\\*\n*   ▢ Optional: fresh arugula\n\n### Dressing\n\n*   ▢ 1 clove garlic, minced\n*   ▢ 1/2 of 1 small shallot, minced\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon grainy Dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon EACH: dried parsley, dried oregano\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n*   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel and chop the butternut squash into small, bite-sized pieces. Place on a sheet pan and toss with the olive oil, dried parsley, dried oregano and salt + pepper (to taste; I add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper). Toss ingredients together and place in the oven. Roast for 10 minutes, remove and stir around, and return to the oven for another 7-10 minutes or until crisp tender (timing will depend on the size of the squash; I chop mine pretty small). Remove the squash tray from the oven and set aside.  \n    \n*   Prepare the dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a mason jar and shaking well to combine.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, add the broth, stock, or water to a small pot. Add in the butter and bring to a boil. Once boiling, remove from heat. Stir in the couscous and cover the pot with a lid. After about 5 minutes the liquid should be absorbed. Fluff with a fork. Stir in 1/3 cup of the prepared dressing.\n    \n*   Assemble the bowls: fill up 4 bowls with even amounts of the dressed couscous. On top add the roasted butternut squash. Add fresh avocado and a handful of arugula to each bowl and top with even amounts of the almonds or pecans. Spoon the remaining dressing evenly (shake again before topping if needed) over the bowls to taste preference. Enjoy immediately.\n    \n\nI buy pre-made honey roasted sliced almonds (or pecan pieces) that are \"ready for salads\" (made by fresh gourmet). You can also roast your own nuts or add them in plain!\n\nWe do our best to provide accurate nutritional analysis for our recipes.

This scrumptious Summer salad is fun, fruity, and flavorful, and topped with the most amazing homemade blueberry balsamic dressing._\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070.jpg)\n\nWhile I’m no stranger to [dumping blueberries into my salads](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/08/blueberry-broccoli-spinach-salad.html), I’ve never once considered blending them into a dressing. Well not until a berry dressing finally knocked my socks off, that is. There’s a sweet raspberry dressing at a local lunch spot here that has totally changed my mind about fruity dressings and holy cow I’ve been missing out!\n\nSince I suspect their berry dressing is laced with enough sugar to classify it as liquid candy, I figured I had two choices: embrace dessert salads and give up donuts in favor of sugar-laden greens \\*OR\\* make my own healthy berry salad dressing at home.\n\nObviously I chose the latter.\n\n_No way am I giving up donuts!_\n\nRaspberries don’t last long in this house, as my [pint-sized sidekick](https://peasandcrayons.com/chickpea), can clear out a carton in a sitting, so I decided to tackle the bucket of farm-fresh blueberries we picked the week prior.\n\nI blended a cup of berries into my go-to [balsamic dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2017/03/strawberry-steak-salad-with-homemade-balsamic-dressing.html) and had to talk myself down from polishing off the entire jar right then and there. I really am kicking myself for not jumping on the fruity dressing bandwagon when it first became a thing. It’s totally legit!\n\nBring on the berries!\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad topped with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peas-and-crayons-2.jpg)\n\n:: vegetarian :: gluten-free :: dairy-free :: paleo :: clean eating ::\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Spring Mix Salad with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 1 heaping cup blueberries\n*   ▢ 1 4-5 oz bag spring mix salad greens\n*   ▢ ½ English cucumber, chopped\n*   ▢ ½ cup mandarin orange segments\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [dried cranberries](https://amzn.to/2xfMnEi)\n*   ▢ 2-4 TBSP roasted unsalted sunflower seeds\n\n#### BLUEBERRY BALSAMIC DRESSING:\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup blueberries\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup [balsamic vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qdt4WJ)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP [red wine vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qgx73B)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 1 TBSP  honey\n*   ▢ 1 tsp salt I use sea salt\n*   ▢ ⅛ tsp black pepper\n*   ▢ ½ cup [avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2fyn7A) olive oil works too\n\n*   First make your dressing: In a [food processor](http://amzn.to/2re4Boz) or [blender](http://amzn.to/2rdX09u), combine all dressing ingredients except for the avocado oil. Blend until blueberries are completely pureed, then use the little top cut-out to drizzle in the avocado oil at the end. Once dressing is emulsified you're good to go!\n    \n*   Wash + dry your greens. \n    \n*   Combine with cucumber and blueberries, then toss with a drizzle or two of dressing. Add extra as desired.\n    \n*   Top with mandarin orange segments, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds and serve!\n    \n\nMaking this salad in advance? Go for it! Mix together everything minus the orange and dressing then combine when ready to serve!\n\nNOTE: This recipe makes a bottle's worth of dressing which will keep great in the fridge for future salads. Only want a little? Feel free to halve the recipe!\n\nRecipe yields 2 large salads or 4 side salads.\n\n_Nutrition Facts below are estimated using an online recipe nutrition calculator.

You can add spinach, arugula, massaged kale, green leaf lettuce, etc…\n\nFeeling fruity? Add any of your favorites such as apples, strawberries, raspberries, and even kiwi.\n\nAs always, you can veg this bad boy up however you’d like!

We think it’s the perfect way to start the day when you’re in search of something savory, warm, satisfying, and hearty. Thanks to the well-balanced nature of this dish, it will keep your blood sugars stable all morning long, leaving you satisfied and ready to tackle the day.\n\nMaking a hash is also the perfect opportunity to ‘clean out the fridge’ and use up what you have on hand.

The sausage is freezer-friendly so if you wish, you could double or triple the sausage portion of the recipe so that you can stock your freezer with some for future meals and recipes.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-8-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Not a kale lover?

You will fall in love with the flavors and find that it compliments almost any meal!\n\nIngredients You’ll Need\n-----------------------\n\nBelow you’ll find the full list of ingredients needed to make this salad happen!\n\n![Ingredients for apple pomegranate salad arranged on a brown wooden cutting board.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pomegranate-salad-ingredients.jpg)\n\n*   **Greens:** For the base of the salad I love using mixed greens, arugula, or kale! \n*   **Apples:** my favorite apples for salad are honey crisp, pink lady, or fuji!\n*   **Pomegranate seeds:** these sweet seeds add the perfect pop of flavor to the salad. \n*   **Nuts:** for the crunchy texture you can use chopped walnuts, pecans, almonds, or hazelnuts. \n*   **Oil:** for the salad dressing! I recommend using quality olive oil. \n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** a quality balsamic vinegar to flavor the salad dressing. \n*   **Honey:** to sweeten the salad dressing! You can also use maple syrup or coconut sugar. \n*   **Garlic powder:** this will add flavor to the salad dressing!\n*   **Cheese:** to add an extra level of flavor you can sprinkle feta or gorgonzola cheese over top!\n\n![A hand using a spoon to stir balsamic vinegar dressing in a liquid measuring cup.](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/butternut-squash-salad-4.jpg)\n\nExtra Tips for Success\n----------------------\n\n*   **Make dairy-free:** This salad is delicious with feta or gorgonzola, but if you need it to be dairy-free you can leave the cheese out altogether. It’s just as delicious!\n*   **Make this salad ahead:** If this salad needs to be prepped ahead of time I recommend storing all the prepped ingredients in separate ziplock bags, then assembling the salad as needed close to the time of serving. \n*   **Add protein:** you can pair this salad with grilled chicken as a protein or for a plant-based option, try lentils or chickpeas.\n*   **More toppings to add:** some extra toppings you can add would be dried cranberries or cherries, roasted butternut squash, cooked wild rice for heartiness, or sliced pears!\n*   **A tip if using kale:** I usually blend the base of this salad with kale and arugula. But if you dislike the texture of kale my best tip would be to chop it really small. It blends right in with the arugula, and no one ever notices!\n\n![A close up of apple pomegranate salad in a bed of greens in a wooden bowl. ](https://asimplepalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/apple-pomegranate-salad.jpg)\n\nWhat to Pair it With\n--------------------\n\nThis salad goes perfectly with just about any meal! But some of my favorite meals to serve it with are alongside this [lemon rosemary chicken and potatoes](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/easy-lemon-rosemary-skillet-chicken/), [air fryer turkey breast](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/maple-herb-air-fryer-turkey-breast/), or this [autumn chicken and butternut squash skillet](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/autumn-roasted-chicken-and-butternut-squash-skillet/).\n\nOther Delicious Salad Recipes to Enjoy\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   [Mediterranean Chickpea Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/mediterranean-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [Tuscan-Style Panzanella Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/tuscan-style-panzanella-salad/)\n*   [Autumn Kale & Roasted Butternut Squash Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/autumn-kale-butternut-squash-salad/)\n*   [Pear and Gorgonzola Salad](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/pear-salad-with-gorgonzola-hazelnuts/)\n\nApple Pomegranate Salad\n-----------------------\n\nThe whole family will love this amazing pomegranate salad!

The opinions and text are all mine._\n\nDoes the cold weather make you just crave comfort food?  I know it does that to me.  And although I have plenty of room on my meal plan for [warm soups](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/), [cheesy pasta](https://www.foxandbriar.com/one-pot-pasta-bake-sausage-wine/) and all other kinds of comfort food, sometimes I want to keep it healthier and focus on fruits and veggies.  As I shared before with my [Roasted Shrimp, Fennel and Grapefruit Kale Salad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/roasted-shrimp-fennel-and-grapefruit-kale-salad/), I like my cool weather salads to be bulked up with roasted veggies and grains.  Here I have kept the farro and kale, but added roasted delicata squash and pomegranate aerials for that sweet tart zing.  Once again, my local Fred Meyer came through for me by having all the ingredients I needed for this salad, including these gorgeous pomegranates.\n\n[Jump to recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/autumn-harvest-salad-with-pomegranates/#recipe)\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

And if you’re reading this post, they’re probably some of yours too, which means we can totally be friends. A friend who shares her bacon is a friend for life. BFFs = Bacon. Friends. _Forevah_.\n\nBrussels sprouts are sort of a culinary line in the sand, right? If you love them, you really _really_ love ’em. You love crispy [Brussels sprouts in the air fryer](https://oursaltykitchen.com/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts/) and [shredded Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/shredded-brussels-sprouts/) in the oven. You love them raw in a salad, and you definitely wouldn’t turn your nose up at [Christmas Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/pan-roasted-brussels-sprouts-cranberries-pistachios/) with pistachios and cranberries.\n\nAnd if you don’t? Well, **you just might need bacon and bourbon to make ’em palatable**. And you’re in luck!\n\nMaple bacon Brussels sprouts are both sweet and savory; crunchy and tender; and oh so very pretty to look at. The best part? This recipe is really easy to make – even for beginners!\n\n![The ingredients for maple bacon Brussels sprouts arranged on a marble table - brussels sprouts, diced bacon, chopped pecans, bourbon, mustard powder, and maple syrup.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-4.jpeg)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   **Brussels Sprouts:** choose the freshest sprouts you can find. In their peak season, you can often find Brussels sprouts still attached to the stalk. Those are great! But they’re not essential. For the freshest Brussels sprouts, look for bright green sprouts with firmly packed leaves that aren’t yellow or withering. Avoid sprouts that are cracked or have too many black spots.\n*   **Bacon:** both regular and thick cut bacon work.\n*   **Pecans:** use raw, unsalted pecans. Coarsely chop them, or buy “pecan pieces”. If you don’t like pecans, walnuts are a nice substitute.\n*   **Ground (Dry) Mustard:** dry mustard is just ground up mustard seeds. On its own, it’s essentially flavorless, but once it’s “activated” by a liquid (in this recipe, bourbon) it bring a pleasant pungency and a bit of acidity to the dish.\n*   **Bourbon:** bourbon is used to deglaze the pan, and lends a smoky flavor. But more importantly, bourbon is slightly acidic! This is important, as the acidity will neutralize the sulfuric odors released during the cooking process (those orders, and resulting flavor, are why some find Brussels sprouts so off-putting. Neutralize it for clean, rich flavor!).\n*   **Maple Syrup:** our sweet foil! Opposites attract, and here we have a few. Maple syrup will balance out the saltiness in the bacon, the pungency of the mustard, and the acidity of the bourbon. It’s a must, so don’t skip!\n\n**BOURBON SUBSTITUTION:** If you don’t consume alcohol, or don’t want to use bourbon, replace it with two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.\n\nHow to Cut Brussels Sprouts\n---------------------------\n\nBefore you even get started, be sure to use sprouts that are (roughly) the same size – this way they’ll cook evenly, at the same rate! The only thing worse than a mushy sprout is an undercooked sprout, and uniformity from the start will make the job that much easier. \n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the ends trimmed.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-1.jpg)\n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the outer leaves peeled off.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n![Side view, trimmed and peeled Brussels sprouts sliced in half on a cutting board.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-3.jpg)\n\n1.  Use sharp paring knife to **trim off the root end** of each sprout.\n2.  **Peel away any withered or yellowed leaves.** If your Brussels sprouts are very fresh you should only need to remove the outer layer.\n3.  **Slice each sprout in half lengthwise**, from top to bottom. This cut allows the densely packed leaves to cook through all the way to the center.\n\nHow to Make Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts\n----------------------------------------\n\nWith maple syrup, bacon, and pecans, this Brussels sprouts recipe has a little something for everyone. Start by blanching the Brussels sprouts in salted water, then finish them on the stove – this method creates tender interiors and crisp edges. The bourbon is optional, but recommended. You can substitute for apple cider vinegar if you don’t cook with alcohol.\n\n![Side view, bacon Brussels sprouts tossed with maple syrup and pecans in a white bowl with a wood spoon.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n1.  **Blanch the Brussels sprouts** in salted water. Cook 4-5 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender but still bright green. They’re ready once you can easily piece the stem using the tip of a knife.\n2.  **Strain the sprouts**, then run them under **cool running water or plunge into an ice bath** to stop the cooking process. Shake well, **then air dry** on a kitchen towel to remove any clinging water droplets.\n3.  **Cook the bacon in a 12″ skillet** over medium heat until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, then **remove the bacon pieces** using a slotted spoon.\n4.  Increase the heat to medium high and **add the Brussels sprouts and pecans** to the rendered bacon fat; **saute** until the edges of the sprouts are crisp, about 5 minutes.\n5.  **Sprinkle the ground mustard** over the sprouts and pecans and cook 1-2 minutes more.\n6.  **Deglaze the pan with the bourbon**, stirring constantly until its completely absorbed.\n7.  **Pour in the maple syrup** and cook 1 minute more, or until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve right away. Enjoy!\n\nChef’s Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Use **real maple syrup**, not pancake syrup, for pure maple flavor.\n*   **Swap pecans for walnuts**, or simply omit them.\n*   **Don’t overcook the Brussels sprouts when blanching!** Drain them when they’re still bright green, after 4-5 minutes.\n*   Season the water with **plenty of kosher salt** – about a tablespoon; it will infuse the Brussels sprouts with flavor from the inside out.\n*   Use a **large, 12″ skillet.** This allows the Brussels sprouts to make lots of contact with the surface for crispier edges.\n*   **Wait to season with salt and pepper** until the end – you may need just a pinch of salt, or none at all.\n\nWhat’s the Easiest Way to Cut Bacon?\n------------------------------------\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to slice bacon with a chef’s knife, it’s sort of a cumbersome process. Use kitchen shears instead! It makes for quick, efficient work.\n\nCan I Make This Recipe in Advance?\n----------------------------------\n\nYes, maple bacon Brussels sprouts are partially make ahead friendly!\n\nBlanch the Brussels sprouts, then plunge them into an ice bath. Drain, then store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Cook in the skillet as directed 15-20 minutes before you’re ready to serve.\n\n![A bowl of maple bacon Brussels sprouts on a marble table with a wood spoon and cream linen napkin to the side.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-3.jpeg)\n\n**Did you make these Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts?

Bring the water to a boil and season with the kosher salt. Add the brussels sprouts to the boil water and give them a good stir. Boil 4-5 minutes, until the sprouts are tender but still bright green in color. Drain in a colander, run under cold water to stop the cooking process, then lay on a kitchen towel to dry.\n    \n*   Place the bacon in a 12\" skillet and heat over medium heat. Saute, stirring occassionally, until the fat renders and bacon is crisp, 7-8 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and place onto a paper-towel lined plate to drain.\n    \n*   Increase the heat to medium high, then add the blanched Brussels sprouts and pecans to the rendered bacon fat. Saute over high heat, stirring frequently, until the sprouts are crisp, 4-5 minutes.\n    \n*   Sprinkle the mustard powder over the sprouts and pecans, then stir constantly for 1 minute. Pour the bourbon (or cider vinegar) into the pan to deglaze; stir and scrape constantly until any browned bits have been scraped up and the bourbon is completely absorbed, 2-3 minutes.\n    \n*   Add the bacon back to the pan, then pour in the maple syrup. Give everything a good toss, then cook 1 minute more, until the syrup is slightly thickened. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper if needed. Serve right away, and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Make Ahead Instructions**\n\nAfter you’ve blanched the Brussels sprouts, drain them well, then spread onto a paper towel or kitchen towel to thoroughly dry. Place them into a sealed container or ziplock bag and place into the fridge, where they’ll keep for about 24 hours. When you’re ready to serve, start with Step 2. The blanched Brussels sprouts can go straight from the fridge to the pan.\n\nServing: 4oz, Calories: 175kcal (9%), Carbohydrates: 18g (6%), Protein: 6g (12%), Fat: 8g (12%), Saturated Fat: 1g (5%), Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g, Monounsaturated Fat: 1g, Trans Fat: 0g, Cholesterol: 5mg (2%), Sodium: 318mg (13%), Potassium: 389mg (11%), Fiber: 3g (12%), Sugar: 2g (2%), Vitamin A: 18% (18%), Vitamin C: 117% (117%), Calcium: 7% (7%), Iron: 8% (8%)\n\n_**Disclaimer:** This post and the recipe card may contain affiliate links, which means we receive a small commission (at no cost to you!) if you make a purchase using these links.

    "markdown": "# Slow Cooker Garlic Butter Chicken and Veggies - The Magical Slow Cooker\nMake **garlic butter chicken** with veggies right in your slow cooker. Chicken tenderloins, baby carrots and gold potatoes are cooked to perfection in a homemade garlic butter sauce.\n\nIf you love easy chicken recipes, try my [slow cooker chicken stew](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-chicken-stew/) recipe and [slow cooker cranberry chicken](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-cranberry-chicken/) recipes.\n\n![chicken with potatoes and carrots in crockpot.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-5.jpg)\n\n \n\nWhy this recipe works\n---------------------\n\nThis recipe isn’t for the faint of heart, this is for my butter loving friends. A stick of butter flavors this meal, but the entire meal. I add garlic, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper to a stick of melted butter. I pour that garlic butter mixture over chicken, carrots, and wedges of Yukon gold potatoes.\n\nNot all slow cooker meals end up being complete meals; I usually have to make a starchy side or make a salad. With this recipe, all the main food groups are covered. The chicken is tender, and so are the veggies. My favorite thing about this meal is the potatoes. There is something about butter and potatoes together that just can’t be beaten. I hope you give this recipe a try! It’s hearty like a pot roast dinner, but with chicken instead. Have a great week. I’ll be back at the end of the week with another recipe.\n\nRecipe Ingredients\n------------------\n\n![Ingredients for garlic butter chicken and vegetables on table.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-ingredients-2.jpg)\n\n*   **Chicken tenderloins** – These cook up perfectly and soak up the garlic butter. You can use boneless skinless chicken breasts if that’s all you have.\n*   **Carrots** – Use one pound of baby carrots or one pound of carrots cut into 1 inch chunks.\n*   **Gold Potatoes** – You can use red or gold potatoes, but we LOVE gold potatoes in this recipe.\n*   **Garlic Butter Sauce** – Salted butter, fresh minced garlic, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper.\n\nStep-by-Step Directions\n-----------------------\n\n![4 steps on how to add chicken, vegetables and garlic butter sauce to slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-collage-1-1200x1200.jpg)\n\n**Step One** – In a small bowl, add the melted salted butter and add minced garlic, salt, pepper, dried thyme, and dried parsley.\n\n**Step Two** –   Place chicken tenders (or breasts) in the middle of the slow cooker. On one side of that place wedges of Yukon gold potatoes and on the other a bag of baby carrots.\n\n**Step Three** – Pour the garlic butter mixture over the chicken and veggies.\n\n**Step Four** – Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours. Serve and enjoy! Plenty of buttery sauce for everyone!\n\n![cooked garlic butter chicken in slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-2.jpg)\n\nVariations\n----------\n\n*   **Green beans** – Green beans cook up so well in the slow cooker, use them instead of the carrots for this garlic butter chicken recipe.\n*   **Easy Peasy** – Instead of making a garlic butter sauce. Use 2/3 cup of Italian dressing.\n*   **Lemon Chicken** – Add the juice of one large lemon to the garlic butter sauce. You can even add the zest of that lemon too.\n*   **Parmesan** – To make the flavor pop in this dish, sprinkle grated parmesan cheese on each individual serving.\n\n![over head shot of plate of chicken, potatoes and vegetables.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-3.jpg)\n\nRecipe FAQs\n-----------\n\n**Can I use olive oil instead of butter?**\n\nOlive oil can be used instead of butter if you are in pinch, though you won’t get as much flavor.\n\n**Can I use chicken broth instead of butter?**\n\nIf you are looking to make this a healthy meal you can use chicken broth instead of butter, or water and a chicken bouillon cube.\n\n**Can I use Italian Seasoning?**\n\nYes! You can use 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning instead of the parsley and thyme.  \n\n**Can I use chicken thighs?**\n\nYes, chicken thighs are a great choice for this recipe. Though, be sure to trim them well.\n\n![chicken tenderloins on plate with carrots and potatoes.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-4.jpg)\n\n**Want to make more magic in your crockpot?** Stay up to date and subscribe to my [**newsletter**](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-secrets/) and follow along on [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/TheMagicalSlowCooker/), [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/themagicalslowcooker/), **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/magicalslowcook/)**, [**Tik Tok**](https://www.tiktok.com/@magicalslowcooker), and [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheMagicalSlowCooker).\n\n![close up of garlic butter chicken and veggies in slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-1-3-300x300.jpg)\n\n*   ▢\n\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken tenders boneless skinless chicken breasts will work fine too\n*   ▢ 1 lb. bag baby carrots\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 lbs.

    "markdown": "# Spicy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls - Jessica Gavin\n_For a satisfying meal try these healthy chicken tomatillo quinoa bowls loaded with wholesome ingredients! Tender chicken is tossed in a spicy and creamy roasted tomatillo sauce for a flavor kick!_\n\n![Healthy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wholesome-chicken-tomatillo-and-quinoa-black-bean-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhen you go to your favorite Mexican restaurant are you a red sauce or green sauce fan? I used to be all about the earthy creamy red sauce poured on top of burritos, enchiladas or stewed meat. Then one day I had a change of heart when I had the most incredible plate of pork Chile Verde. I’ve been itching to learn how to make tomatillo sauce that could I use for just about any meal.\n\nToday I’m sharing a healthy chicken tomatillo bowl! You will learn how to make the sauce from scratch paired with a creamy, and spicy chicken topped on a bed of [cooked quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/). I will leave the rest of the extra toppings up to you, but at least you’ll have the essential recipe.\n\n![a sheet pan filled with green tomatillos](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fresh-tomatillos-onions-pasilla-chilis-garlic-for-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhat are Tomatillos?\n--------------------\n\nYou may have seen them hanging out next to the hot peppers in the produce aisle, but have you dared to cook with them? To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first, but I gave it a shot. Here are the basics of using tomatillos in cooking.\n\n*   Tomatillos are a member of the nightshade family. They are wrapped in a wrinkly paper husk, and once you remove the outer layer a gorgeous candy-apple green colored fruit appears. You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.\n*   Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.\n*   To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.\n\n![making green salsa with peppers and onions](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/oven-roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nThe base for the tomatillo sauce is, of course, the green fruit to add it’s characteristic tangy flavor, jalapeno, and pasilla (or poblano) peppers for heat, caramelized purple onions for sweetness and buttery roasted garlic for earthiness.\n\nCheck out how all of the fruit, vegetables, and aromatics just melt together in the pan after roasting. So many incredible flavors in one place, divine!\n\n![side by side before and after photos of sauce ingredients from solid to puree](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-before-and-after-blending-600x450.jpg)\n\nNow it’s time to bring the sauce components together! Chicken broth and fresh parsley are added to the roasted ingredients, then pureed in my Vitamix Blender until smooth.\n\nSo the first taste I took off the tomatillo salsa, it was SPICY! If you want more of a mild sauce, remove the seeds and inner membranes of the jalapenos and pasilla peppers before roasting. Or even add just one jalapeno instead of two. However once I added some yogurt to the sauce, that helped bring down the heat. This recipe makes a lot of sauce so that you can use it for another meal like [enchiladas](https://www.jessicagavin.com/chicken-enchiladas-with-pumpkin-sauce/), or even as a salsa with some crunchy chips!\n\n![chicken breasts being seared in a pan](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/spiced-sauteed-chicken-breast-600x900.jpg)\n\nLet’s talk POLLO. For the shredded chicken, I like to add a generous amount of spices for flavor, and a short [saute](https://www.jessicagavin.com/sauteing/) so that the chicken stays nice and juicy. You can bake, or poach the chicken, but I like the flavors developed on the surface from the sear with the sauteed chicken. If you are in a pinch for time, grab a roasted chicken from the store and shred away.\n\n![spoon mixing green sauce with shredded chicken](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/creamy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-1-600x900.jpg)\n\nOh yea, check out this creamy green goodness! The spicy tomatillo sauce gets combined with just a touch of plain Greek yogurt to add a creamy texture to each bite. The yogurt also helps to back the heat a bit, but it’s still got a nice kick! The sauce and the chicken get tossed together, and it’s ready for bowl customization.\n\n![top down view of two bowls of chicken tomatillo served on top of quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healthy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-bowls-with-quinoa-600x900.jpg)\n\nIt’s topping time! I like a balance of textures and making sure I get a variety of colors for extra nutritional benefits. I add sliced radishes, limes, chopped red onions, black beans, diced avocado and tomatoes to the bowl. The additional protein, fiber, and phytonutrients make this a healthy meal that you will crave!\n\n![close of up a chicken quinoa bowl](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-tomatillo-chicken-and-quinoa-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nGrab a fork and let’s dig in! If you are having guests over you can create a build-your-own chicken bowl bar and put out different toppings and even have brown rice or vegetable noodles to fill. What other tasty dishes would you add the tomatillo sauce? I would love to hear so I can try!\n\nHow do you pick ripe tomatillos?\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen tomatillos are ripe, they are juicy, firm and tart. A few guidelines when you are at the market to pick ripe tomatillos are go for smaller sizes. They tend to be a little sweeter. Slightly peel back the husk and look for bright green colored fruit. This will yield a more tangy fruit which is what you want in your dish. Pale yellow or light green tomatillo will be overripe but less tart. Touch the outside of the husk and look for it to be sticky and not dry and the fruit should fill most of the husk. Pick firm tomatillos, if it’s too soft, it’s past it’s prime.\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   ▢ 20 tomatillos\n*   ▢ 2 jalapeño peppers, stems removed\n*   ▢ 3 pasilla chilies, or poblanos, stems removed\n*   ▢ ½ red onion, cut in half\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole\n*   ▢ 1 cup unsalted chicken broth, or stock\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, packed\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons nonfat plain Greek yogurt, or lowfat sour cream\n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup quinoa\n*   ▢ 2 cups water\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to ¾-inch thick\n*   ▢ black pepper\n*   ▢ [paprika](https://www.jessicagavin.com/what-is-paprika/)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 425°F. Remove the paper off of the tomatillos and place them on a large baking pan. Add jalapeño peppers, pasilla chilies and cut red onion to the same pan.\n    \n*   Drizzle the chilies with one tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n    \n*   Place the peeled garlic in foil, lightly drizzle with oil and wrap into a packet that is open from the top, place on the corner of the baking pan. Roast chilies, onion, and garlic for 40 minutes stirring chilies after 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa and chicken.\n    \n*   Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.\n    \n*   Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.\n    \n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   Add 1 cup quinoa to a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse well with running water. Transfer to a pot with lid. Add 2 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt.\n    \n*   Bring to a boil, put a lid on then reduce to a simmer, over medium-low heat. Allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until water is absorbed, then turn off the heat. Allow it to sit with the lid on for at least 5 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork when ready to serve.\n    \n*   Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes.

But, if you’re a fan of a creamy pasta salad, or an ultra easy-to-make pasta salad that’s loaded with healthier goodness (plus bacon!), this avocado and bacon pasta salad is for you.\n\nOnce the garden tomatoes come into harvest, BLT sandwiches are a staple at our house. And the only thing that makes them even better is adding avocado for them to become BLATs. Bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato sandwiches that are now a BBQ pasta salad staple.\n\nSo when my daughter requested I make a pasta salad that included her beloved bacon in the BLT mix, avocado was an obvious addition to make.\n\n[![BLT pasta salad ingredients in glass bowl](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1.jpg)\n\nBLT Pasta Salad Ingredients\n---------------------------\n\nI’m sure you can already guess the key ingredients in this BLT pasta salad recipe, but I added in a few more veggies to add extra pops of flavor. Instead of lettuce, I used peppery arugula, which pairs beautifully with the ranch pasta salad dressing. And I prefer using cherry tomatoes in this BLT pasta salad because they’re so juicy and hold their shape nicely.\n\nThe other ingredients you’ll need for this potluck side dish are:\n\n*   Pasta\n*   Bacon\n*   Cherry tomatoes\n*   Arugula\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Greek yogurt\n*   Mayonnaise\n*   White vinegar\n*   Chives\n*   Parsley\n*   Garlic powder\n*   Salt and pepper\n\nThe pasta salad dressing is a little healthier, because I used Greek yogurt instead of full flavored mayonnaise and sour cream. But thanks to the fresh herbs it has a totally fresh and delicious flavor.\n\nAs with any cold pasta salad, taste the dressing after you’ve whisked it together to see if it needs more salt or pepper. It’s much easier to season the dressing before it’s been tossed with the pasta!\n\n[![container of greek yogurt next to sliced red onion on counter](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002.jpg)\n\nHow to Make BLT Pasta Salad\n---------------------------\n\nTo make this homemade pasta salad, you’ll first need to cook the pasta noodles according to the package’s instructions. I tend to undercook my pasta just a bit for pasta salads so it doesn’t turn to mush as it absorbs the salad dressing.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, dice the bacon and cook it until it reaches your desired level of crispness. Note that you won’t have to oil the pan before cooking the bacon in it as the bacon will release a good amount of fat as it cooks.\n\nOnce the pasta has cooled slightly and the bacon and veggies have been prepped, add everything to a large bowl and toss to combine.\n\nNext up is the dressing. This pasta salad dressing is so easy to make, and is an easier rendition of [my homemade Ranch dressing](https://www.foodiecrush.com/homemade-ranch-dressing-recipe/) for saucing this easy pasta salad. In a separate bowl, whisk together the homemade ranch dressing. Pour the dressing over the BLT pasta salad and gently stir to distribute it.\n\n[![Homemade Ranch Dressing Recipe | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)\n\nCan I Use Fat-Free Greek Yogurt?\n--------------------------------\n\nPersonally, I would steer clear of using fat-free yogurt in this homemade pasta salad. Fat-free yogurts are often loaded with additives to make up for their flavor, and have a tendency to separate. Stick to low-fat or whole milk plain Greek yogurt for this recipe.\n\nThe Best Pastas for Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nI like this pasta salad best with a short pasta noodle, and like in my [Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/)  I use my favorite shell noodle. But, there are quite a few other types you can try, like:\n\n*   Farfalle (bowtie or butterflies)\n*   Gemelli (twists)\n*   Fusilli (springs)\n*   Campanelle (flowers)\n*   Penne (tubes)\n*   Orichette (ears)\n\nAlways cook your pasta in water that’s been generously salted. I always prefer kosher salt to regular table or iodized salt because it’s not as harsh due to its larger, flakier crystals.\n\n[![BLT Pasta Salad with Avocado | foodiecrush.com #pasta #salad #BLT #bacon #tomato #avocado #recipes](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013.jpg)\n\nCan I Prep This Pasta Salad in Advance?\n---------------------------------------\n\nI actually prefer my pasta salads to be served chilled, so yes, you can definitely prep this bacon pasta salad in advance. Just note that the longer the bacon sits in the dressing, the less crisp it will be when you serve this pasta salad.\n\nWith that said, this BLT pasta salad will be fine if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to serving it. This will give the flavors time to come together.\n\nCan I Double This BLT Pasta Salad Recipe?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re making this pasta salad for a backyard BBQ or potluck party, you can easily double the recipe if you’ll be feeding a _lot_ of people. One pound of pasta makes a lot of pasta salad, and the salad as-is serves 12 or more, but will stretch further if you’re serving other salads or side dishes along with it.\n\n[![close up of avocado and bacon pasta salad](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009.jpg)\n\nTips for Making BLT Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you’re out of ingredients or out of time to make the easy homemade dressing, feel free to use a quality bottled ranch dressing instead.\n\nWe prefer using classic pork bacon to make this BLT pasta salad, but you’re welcome to use any type of bacon you’d like.\n\nOne final note: the sliced avocado will brown as it sits in this BLT pasta salad. Personally, I don’t mind eating brown avocado (it’s perfectly safe to eat!), but if that’s something you’re worried about you can wait to stir it in until just before you serve this homemade pasta salad.\n\nMore Pasta Salad Ideas to Try\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Classic Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/) (this one always gets raves)\n*   [Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto](https://www.foodiecrush.com/craving-5-recipes-for-creamy-macaroni-salad/ \"Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto\")\n*   [Easy Italian Spaghetti Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/easy-italian-spaghetti-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Creamy Tuscan Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/tuscan-pasta-salad/)\n*   [How to Make Classic Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-classic-macaroni-salad/) (because classics always win!)\n*   [Kale Caesar Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/kale-caesar-pasta-salad/ \"Kale Caesar Pasta Salad\")\n*   [Greek Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/greek-pasta-salad-cucumbers-artichoke-hearts/)\n\n**If you mak****e this recipe, please let me know!

It’s SO good!\n\nNot only am I exploring foods from other countries but I’m looking for anything that can be put on the grill or smoker. It’s just downright “HOT” in the south.

    "markdown": "# Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe (Savory Japanese Pancakes) - A Food Lover's Kitchen\n*    votes\n*   [Jump to Recipe](#recipe)\n\nThis popular Japanese dish from Osaka, this **Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe** is a savory pancake made with cabbage, vegetable, meat or seafood, and a delicious sauce.\n\nIt’s not a difficult recipe to make, so trust me when I say it’s way more accessible to home cooks than it might look. In fact, there are many different styles of Okonomiyaki throughout Japan, not just one particular way of making it, so you can kind of do whatever version makes you happy, rather than worrying about getting it right.\n\n_» You are going to love these handcrafted [Japanese Gyoza!](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/homemade-japanese-gyoza/)_\n\n![Okonomiyaki\nEasy okonomiyaki recipe](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/okonomiyaki-t1.jpg)\n\nThe first time I had Okonomiyaki was at a supper club dinner. A friend of ours had just been to Japan and wanted to share this awesome dish with us. It was so good, I wanted to learn how to make it myself.\n\nA year later we went to Japan ourselves and we were obsessed with seeking out the best Okonomiyaki we could find. We learned that it comes in many variations, so we tried as many as possible. The version in this recipe has shrimp and bacon in it, but you can easily make it vegetarian or add chicken… whatever you like.\n\n![okonomiyaki batter](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-batter.jpg)\n\nDoes Okonomiyaki Require Special Ingredients?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOkonomiyaki is basically a savory pancake made with cabbage, flour, egg and water. Most of us keep those items in the kitchen at all times, so technically you can make a pretty decent okonomiyaki right now.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that make it extra special. These are somewhat specialty ingredients, that you don’t likely have on hand.\n\nFirst off, there is a special [okonomiyaki flour](https://amzn.to/2IFTg80) that is used in Japan. They also use [dashi](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi-3-ways/) for the liquid, rather than plain water. Both of these ingredients give the pancake something extra special. However, they are not necessary ingredients to make a great Okonomiyaki.\n\nThese Japanese pancakes are best served with a few key toppings, including [Okonomiyaki sauce](https://amzn.to/2xi8o4R), [Japanese mayonnaise](https://amzn.to/2X2wX5f), [bonito flakes](https://amzn.to/3UXrck4), and seaweed. I personally can get all of these items from a Japanese shop near my house, but I realize they can be difficult to find. Don’t worry.\n\nWhile these pancakes are best when served with all these toppings, it’s by no means a requirement. Below, we will suggested substitutions for the difficult to find ingredients.\n\n![spicy mayo and okonomiyaki sauce](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-sauce.jpg)\n\nHow to Make This Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe most important part of making this recipe is ensuring the cabbage is softened, since fresh cabbage contains a lot of water. You don’t want to make soggy pancakes.\n\nTo avoid this, you need to salt the cabbage and allow it to sweat off some of its water. Then rinse the salt from the cabbage and dry it thoroughly with paper towels.\n\nI also find that the cabbage is best when it’s chopped into rather small pieces – the size of a dime or slightly smaller. The larger it is, the longer it takes to cook and less surface area for the pancake to brown on the grill.\n\nMix up the batter, add the pre-sweated cabbage and other ingredients, and you’re ready to go. Pour the batter onto a hot griddle. An [electric griddle](https://amzn.to/2LUg1qr \"Electric Griddle\") like this one is perfect for the task, but you can just use a flat [crepe pan](https://amzn.to/30SoG41 \"Crepe pan\") as well.\n\nSpread out the batter to form a 5-inch round pancake. You can flatten out the batter and cabbage so it forms a flat cake, rather than a mountain, but be careful not to pack it down or press it into the grill. It needs the flow of steam to cook the cabbage properly.\n\n![cooking okonomiyaki on the griddle](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-cooking.jpg)\n\nAllow it to cook, undisturbed, for about 5 minutes. When it’s golden brown on the bottom, flip it over. It’ll need to cook an additional 5 minutes on the other side for the cabbage to cook thoroughly.\n\nWhen it’s done, remove it from the pan and cover it with your toppings of choice. I start with a drizzle of Okonomi sauce, then some mayo or [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3O69c2g \"Sriracha\") mayo (which add an extra spicy kick). You can stop there. Or you can also add bonito flakes, some scallions, seaweed flakes, etc.\n\nIf you can’t get Okonomi sauce near your home, you can get it on Amazon. You could also substitute it with a homemade sauce made from ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce and sugar.\n\n[Here’s a recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki-sauce/) I use sometimes when I don’t have the real sauce on hand. It’s also acceptable to use BBQ sauce, if you don’t want to make the effort to mix up your own sauce.\n\n![Okonomiyaki](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/okonomiyaki-w2.jpg)\n\nI’ve made this many times at home and I’m always surprised and happy with how well they turn out. They’re crispy on the outside, while still airy and light on the inside.\n\nThe cabbage gets steamed nicely while it’s on the griddle, so it’s no longer crunchy, but not soggy either.\n\nOf course, the sauce is a huge part of the equation too. Without the sauce, the pancake alone lacks luster. With the sauce, the flavors come together nicely to form one tasty pancake.\n\n### Other recipes you might like\n\n*   [BBQ Pork Belly Slices](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/bbq-pork-belly-slices-recipe/)\n*   [Vietnamese Pork Bowls](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/vietnamese-pork-bowls/)\n*   [The Best Crispy Chicken Sandwich](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/crispy-chicken-sandwich/)\n\n### YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\n**Like it, Love it, Want Some More of It?** [Subscribe to our newsletter](https://app.zagomail.com/forms/preview?id=5092) and **follow us** on **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/foodloverskitchen/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/afoodloverskitchen/)** and **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/afoodloverskitchen/)**.

Same delicious recipe!_\n\nI don’t think I could ever tire of strawberries. And with strawberry season here and gone so quickly, we must take advantage!\n\nHere in the Midwest, summertime is a constant reminder to truly take things in. To enjoy the days as they are. To accept both the hot (often humid here) weather and the thunderstorms. To take advantage of the long days and spend more time with one another. To get outside and enjoy nature and the blue skies before it gets cold and gray again.\n\nEven though the days are longer, these months do not last long, and I’m finding that summer teaches us to be more present. To appreciate what we have when we have it. It is all about perspective. And finding joy in the little things.\n\nThe Perfect Strawberry Salad\n----------------------------\n\nThis spinach strawberry salad recipe is going to be on repeat all season!\n\nIt’s the perfect **light and refreshing lunch or dinner salad** – just add your favorite protein like chicken breasts, [salmon](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/sweet-spicy-glazed-salmon-paleo/), tempeh, [roasted chickpeas](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/chickpea-shawarma-bowls/), etc.\n\nThe **coconut honey lime dressing adds unique flavor** and is so delicious – I could drink it!\n\nThis simple salad can be **easily customizable and adapted to your liking.** Or your guests liking, depending on who you’re enjoying it with.\n\nThis is the **perfect salad recipe for picky eaters** – who doesn’t love strawberries and sweet creamy poppy seed dressing?\n\n[![hands using silver salad tongs in bowl of spinach with strawberries](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-14.jpg)](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-14.jpg)\n\nSalad Ingredients\n-----------------\n\n*   **spinach –** I prefer spinach for this strawberry salad but you could always do a mix of greens or use what you have on hand.\n*   **strawberries** – fresh, juicy ones!

Here, I’ve included the method used by restaurants to get that ideal, slightly dried-out rice without having to wait a day. The YouTube channel [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChineseCookingDemystified/) is one of my favorite places to go for all my Chinese culinary questions. The method that its hosts Steph and Chris use to par-boil then steam the rice is borderline miraculous in the results you get. The Delish kitchen team was floored at the consistent texture you get with the rice, and I for one will not be cooking my rice any other way going forward.  \n• **Oil:** Choose an oil with a high-smoke point, and don’t be afraid to use a lot of oil—this is fried rice after all.  \n• **Eggs**: I use 3 large eggs in this recipe. I prefer to have some white streaks in my eggs, so I barely beat them together.  \n• **Garlic:** I like my fried rice super garlicky, so I use 5 cloves. You can take it back if you want, but honestly, I don’t suggest it—the more garlic, the better.  \n• **Ginger:** About an inch of ginger, minced very small, goes with the garlic before adding in our veggies.  \n• **Scallions:** When chopping your scallions, separate the whites and the greens. The green we’ll use as a garnish, and the white we’ll cook with.  \n• **Soy Sauce:** The first thing you’ll notice about this recipe is that soy sauce is included. While to some, this might not be super-traditional in fried rice, a lot of American eaters (and Delish taste testers) prefer it! Because there is no meat or seafood in this fried rice, after some testing, I felt it added some extra body and umami to the rice that is totally delicious. I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce so you can control the salt amount.  \n• **Sugar:** I believe that all savory dishes should be finished off with a bit of sugar if there isn’t a natural source of sweetness in it. It helps to round out the dish and provide a more complex flavor.  \n• **White Pepper:** White pepper is underutilized outside of fancier kitchens, but it’s worth buying if you can. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite things about this recipe; at home, I’ll add even more. It’s earthy, and has less of a kick than black pepper.  \n• **MSG:** MSG adds the perfect sweet-salty boost to fried rice. It’s a widely misunderstood ingredient—checkout this article all about [MSG](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35119070/msg-monosodium-glutamate/) if you’re looking to learn more.  \n• **Peas:** I personally love peas in fried rice, and find it’s a common addition in many American versions. Don’t worry about using frozen peas, they won’t emit too much moisture to the rice.  \n• **Butter:** Using butter is a bit controversial, but it adds a wonderful richness, and a little bit goes a long way. If you really don’t want to use it, you can omit it.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nLeftover rice works perfectly for fried rice, so if you have some hanging out in your fridge, use it here. But, if you don’t have any, never fear: I’ve found a 2-step technique to make freshly cooked rice absolutely perfect for fried rice. The first step of making any rice dish is to adequately clean your rice. Some people like to do this in the pot they’re going to cook their rice in, but I like to use a mesh strainer. Rinse the rice—moving around the grains frequently—until the water comes out clean.\n\nOnce your rice is ready, you’re going to par-boil the rice for just a few minutes. This will help to jumpstart the cooking process, breaking down the outsides of the grains of rice.\n\nOnce you strain the rice, we’re ready to make an impromptu steamer with a pot and a strainer that fits inside of it. First, add some water to the bottom of the pot, then put the strainer filled with your rinsed rice in it. Next, you’re going to want to create some holes in the rice with chopsticks to allow steam to circulate.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9983579638752053xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter making your holes, cover the pot with tin foil; it doesn’t have to be totally snug, but it should be well-tented. Then, cover with the pot lid and let it steam. Steaming the rice is a gentler cooking process that keeps the grains pretty dry and adds less moisture to the rice, which is what we’re looking for.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, check on your rice: It should almost taste al-dente. What I mean by this is that it should be fully cooked through, but should taste drier than normal steamed rice. Once it’s ready, I like to spread my rice on a sheet pan. This is a bit of overkill, but it will help your rice to cool down more quickly (which means fried rice faster!).\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNow that our rice is ready, let’s focus on bringing everything together. A wok is the most traditional way to cook fried rice, and it does work especially well. The movement and centralized heat are very helpful, and its size holds a large amount of rice . But if you don’t have one, don’t let that stop you: I’ve made incredible fried rice in a cast iron skillet.\n\nBarely beat the eggs together (if you prefer some whites in your egg) before adding to your wok. Once you add to the wok, move your eggs around quickly, pressing in with a spatula to make those perfect fried rice egg squiggles. Once they’re ready, take them out, and give your wok a quick wipe down. I recommend pre-cooking your eggs because if they sit in the fried rice for awhile, they will get overcooked.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNext, it’s time to add your oil. Don’t be shy here: This is fried rice after all, so add enough to coat all of the grains in the oil. Add in your ginger and garlic: This will help flavor the oil which will transfer to your entire dish. Then, add the green onions and cook until softened, flipping and stirring frequently to prevent any burning.\n\nAdd all of your rice, tossing and stirring it constantly (I mean it!). You should see the grains start to become individual, which is the tell-tale sign of a well-done fried rice. Once you see that the rice is separating, it’s time to add your seasonings and soy sauce.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nOnce your rice is perfectly seasoned and separated, it’s time to add in your eggs and peas.

Learn how to make healthy zucchini fries instead of potatoes for a less guilty snack. These are so flavorful! \n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries on a cutting board ](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-2.jpg \"Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox\")\n\nEasy Baked Zucchini Fries Recipe\n--------------------------------\n\nWhat to do when life gives you a ton of zucchini? Make baked parmesan zucchini fries! And more of it please! It’s really a fantastic way to use up zucchini when you run out of zucchini recipe ideas. When you’re craving fries, without all the starch from potatoes, using zucchini is a fabulous way to satisfy those cravings without all the calories. It’s mind blowing how delicious and easy these zucchini fries are. And it’s even more mind blowing why we didn’t make them earlier because they’re low carb, no bread crumbs and tasty!\n\n**Video: Healthy Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries** \n-------------------------------------------------\n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries on a cutting board ](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-1.jpg \"Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox\")\n\nZucchini Fries Recipe with No Bread Crumbs KETO\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*   The flavors are outstanding. We add parmesan, some paprika, fresh herbs and other spices to really add amazing flavor to the humble zucchini sticks. They’re simply delicious and a perfect zucchini fry appetizer for anytime you’re wanting a simple dish to have a party.\n*   Add some extra onion powder for another kick of flavor.\n*   Have you tried steak seasoning? It’s not just for steak! This seasoning is really great on the zucchini.\n*   Even beyond a great finger food, they’re definitely lighter than potatoes. These zucchini fries are baked and all the wonderful flavors get cooked into the zucchini. Each bite is wonderful and low carb!\n*   All recipe details are in the recipe box below.\n\n### Keto Coating Options\n\nThere’s several more options for keto “bread crumbs” other than the parmesan cheese that we use.\n\n*    Crushed pork rinds are probably the most common and popular. You can buy these pre-crushed and ready to use. Or you can buy a bag of pork rinds and then grind them in your food processor. This option allows you to customize the grind of your pork rinds. You can make the coating find or more coarse/crunchy.\n*   Almond flour is another popular option. But we find that the parmesan cheese and crushed pork rinds will result in the most crispy outside texture. If you don’t use enough oil spray on the outside of the almond flour, the crust can be rather mushy and dry.\n*   Sesame seeds are another option. You’ll get a great flavor of sesame on the zucchini.\n\n### Can You Make this Ahead of time?\n\nYou can make these ahead, but they’ll be pretty soggy the next day. Best way to crisp them up is in a toaster oven or [air fryer](https://bestrecipebox.com/air-fryer-zucchini/). Add a light oil spray over them so they don’t dry out during heating.\n\n![Baked Parmesan Zucchini Fries | @bestrecipebox](https://bestrecipebox.com/images/Baked-Parmesan-Zucchini-Fries-1-250x250.jpg)\n\nBaked Parmesan Zucchini Fries\n-----------------------------\n\nYield: 6 servings\n\nPrep Time: 5 minutes\n\nCook Time: 18 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 23 minutes\n\nThese are so good, not \"crispy\" becuase they're healthy but still tasty. There's no bread crumbs so they're a little healthier than most zucchini fries recipes and less crispy. If you want them crispy and not keto, add bread crumbs to the coating, then spray the outside before baking.\n\n*   1 1/2 lbs. (680 g) zucchini ,cut lengthwise into wedges (about 3 medium zucchini)\n*   1/2 cup (50 g) freshly grated Parmesan\n*   1 teaspoon (5 ml) dried herbs – thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, etc…\n*   1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) smoked paprika\n*   1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) garlic powder\n*   [Kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2LzFKoG) , to taste\n*   black pepper , to taste (freshly ground if possible)\n*   2 tablespoons (30 ml) [olive oil](https://amzn.to/2uMlvKN)\n*   3 tablespoons (45 ml) chopped fresh parsley leaves\n\n*   Preheat oven to 400° F. Line baking sheet with parchment or aluminum foil. Spray with non-stick cooking spray.\n    \n*   In bowl, combine Parmesan, dried herbs, smoked paprika and garlic powder salt and pepper, to taste.\n    \n*   Toss the zucchini with olive oil and roll in parmesan/herb mixture to coat all sides. Place zucchini onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with extra parmesan/herb mixture if needed.\n    \n*   Bake until crisp, about 15 minutes.

    "markdown": "# Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich - FeelGoodFoodie\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/privacy-policy/).\n\nThis delicious grilled mozzarella sandwich is perfect to make when you want something fresh with a gourmet quality, but don’t want to go to a restaurant. **Homemade walnut pesto, fresh tomatoes and melted mozzarella** make every bite full of flavor. Be sure to make a double batch of the pesto so you can whip up a tasty sandwich later on in the week.\n\n![Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich made with walnut pesto, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-8.jpg)\n\nRECIPE VIDEO TUTORIAL\n---------------------\n\nHow to make grilled mozzarella sandwich – step by step\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n### To make the pesto\n\nPlace the **basil, garlic, walnuts and Parmesan cheese in the food processor;** season with salt and pepper, to taste, and blend. While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n\n![Collage showing how to make walnut pesto before and after blending in food processor](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-Collage1.jpg)\n\n### To assemble the sandwiches\n\nYou will need some **sourdough bread** sliced about ½ inch thick, **whole mozzarella cheese**, the **pesto** you just successfully whipped up, along with large **tomato slices and roasted red pepper**.\n\n![Ingredients to make the recipes: bread, pesto, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-3-640x427.jpg)\n\nNext, you’ll want to **spread the pesto** on four slices of the sourdough bread, and place two of the slices right on the panini maker with the pesto side up.\n\n![Spreading walnut pesto on the bread before assembling and grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-4-640x427.jpg)\n\nThe assembly all happens in the panini maker, [like this one](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) (or toaster oven or grill pan). Add the mozzarella cheese on right away, and give it a minute to settle in and start melting. Start piling the tomatoes and roasted red peppers (carefully).\n\n![Two open faced sandwiches in the panini topped with tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-5-640x427.jpg)\n\nAnd then, **close the sandwich with the remaining bread** (pesto side down) and close the panini maker. This is seriously the hardest part of the recipe. The type of bread you use and how high you stack the sandwich can really make or break the sandwich. You want to **lightly press on the sandwich** so we don’t end up with a pressed pile of cheesy bread (although I have done it and it is delicious still haha!)\n\n![Sandwich assembled in the panini before grilling](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-6-640x427.jpg)\n\nYou’ll know it’s done when the bread is crispy and golden brown and the mozzarella cheese is melty. It’s a sandwich recipe that looks totally gourmet and tastes out of this world!\n\n![Sandwich after coming off the panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-7.jpg)\n\nTips for making grilled mozzarella sandwich\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Don’t have a panini maker?** [This panini maker](https://amzn.to/2HAzCK7) is great, or you can use a toaster oven to achieve the same result (minus those pretty grill lines). You can also use a grill pan or regular pan to make this sandwich recipe.\n2.  **Don’t have a food processor?** Just buy store-bought pesto! But really, if you can find a way to make your own pesto, it really takes this sandwich to another level.\n3.  Make sure you use the **freshest ingredients** you can for maximum flavor. That is especially true for the basil and the mozzarella cheese.\n4.  **Use thick sturdy sourdough bread** that is not airy on the inside to ensure the sandwich stays put when you press on it in the panini maker.\n\n![Grilled Mozzarella Sandwich made with walnut pesto, tomatoes and roasted red peppers](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-8.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Is a grilled mozzarella sandwich healthy?\n\nOne sandwich comes in at under 450 calories, so even though it’s not low in calories, it’s certainly **better for you than a lot of store bought sandwiches**. Making your own pesto is certainly a healthier option than buying store bought because there aren’t preservatives or milk or other unnecessary ingredients added. To make the sandwich lighter, you can use whole wheat bread which contains more fiber, and you can use a low fat mozzarella if you so wish.\n\n### How do you make homemade walnut pesto?\n\nPesto is so easy to make at home. We are all so used to buying the jarred stuff, but fresh is always better! Use a **good olive oil, super fresh basil leaves (or any greens really) and some nuts**. Add the dry ingredients to a food processor, and while they are combining, slowly pour in the olive oil. Easy! Be sure to make an extra batch and stir it into fresh pasta!\n\n![Mozzarella Grilled Sandwich stacked with basil on the side](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Grilled-Mozzarella-Sandwich-9.jpg)\n\nFor more delicious sandwich recipes:\n------------------------------------\n\n*   [Turkey Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/turkey-panini/)\n*   [Roasted Vegetable Grilled Cheese Sandwich](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Pesto Chicken Avocado Panini](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/pesto-chicken-avocado-panini/)\n*   [Cheesy Chicken & Broccoli Wraps](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/cheesy-chicken-broccoli-wraps/)\n\nI really hope you enjoy this grilled mozzarella sandwich recipe as much as we did!

I would love to hear about your experience making it. And if you snapped some shots of it, share it with me on Instagram so I can repost on my stories!\n\n![](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cookbook2.png)\n\nPrep Time 10 minutes\n\nCook Time 5 minutes\n\nTotal Time 15 minutes\n\n#### For the Sandwich\n\n*   ▢ 4 slices sourdough bread\n*   ▢ 4 oz mozzarella cheese sliced\n*   ▢ 1 large tomato sliced\n*   ▢ 2 oz roasted red peppers jarred\n\n#### For the Pesto\n\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves\n*   ▢ 2 cloves garlic clove peeled\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons [walnuts](https://amzn.to/3l3EWMl)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan\n*   ▢ [Salt and pepper](https://amzn.to/3WZ1xXy)\n*   ▢ 1/4 cup [olive oil](https://amzn.to/3dfY3Ld)\n\n*   To make the pesto, place the basil, garlic, walnuts and Parmesan cheese in the food processor; season with salt and pepper, to taste, and blend. While the food processor is on, pour the olive oil slowly into the mixture in order to allow the olive oil to emulsify.\n    \n*   Spread the pesto equally on the 4 slices of bread and place two slices of bread on the panini maker or in a toaster oven for 2 minutes.\n    \n*   Then place the mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and roasted red peppers on top of two bread slices and allow the cheese to melt and the veggies to soften, keeping the panini maker open.\n    \n*   Once the cheese starts to melt, add the second slices on top to close the sandwiches, then close the panini maker for 2-3 minutes. Remove, slice in half and serve immediately\n    \n\n**Storage:** Leftover pesto should be covered and stored in the refrigerator, it will keep fresh for one week. I would not recommend storing the sandwich though for more than a couple hours. If you have sandwich leftovers, it’s best to reheat using a toaster oven or panini maker.\n\n**Make Ahead Tips:** You can make the pesto up to one week in advance and then use in the the grilled sandwich when you’re ready.\n\n**Substitutes:** For best results, follow the recipe as is. However here are some common substitutes that would work well in this recipe.\n\n*   _Instead whole mozzarella_, you can use shredded mozzarella. Although I think it creates a completely different flavor and texture to the sandwich.\n*   _Instead of walnuts_, you can use other nuts, like pine nuts, almonds or pecans, to make the pesto\n\n**Equipment**: I use the [Kitchen Aid 7-Cup Food processor](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KFP0718CU-7-Cup-Processor-Puree/dp/B07BVYPDJ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=30RV8LXKUP8I8&keywords=kitchenaid+7+cup+food+processor&qid=1552749952&s=gateway&sprefix=kitchen+aid+7+cup,aps,240&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=feelgoodfoodie-20&linkId=35c757d4f7499b6121fbed25a3cbd49d&language=en_US) [Kitchen Aid 11-Cup Food Processor](https://amzn.to/2Qe4KFo) to to make the pesto. It has a high and low pulse speed so you can make the pesto as smooth or chunky as you’d like. And it has a 3-in-1 wide mouth feed tube to make it easier to slowly add olive oil while the machine is running.\n\nIt’s so fun to make sandwiches in my panini maker.

We have spent it almost entirely doing wall prep (3 days!!) and painting (1 day) our guest bedroom and we were dead people walking at the end of yesterday. When we ventured out for dinner last night, we were so tired that we were barely able to keep our eyes open.\n\nIt was really hard work, but it paid off – the room already looks ten times better and it’s not even finished yet. We are nearly done with the ceiling and the walls (the 3rd and final coat of paint goes on tomorrow), but the skirting boards and the radiator will need to wait until our guests leave, as we don’t want to poison them with paint fumes. My brother and his partner are visiting us this Friday and, especially after the weekend we’ve had, we are really looking forward to spending some relaxing time with them. We have not seen each other for ages and they recently returned from some exciting travels, so we cannot wait to catch up and hear all they’ve been up to.\n\nWhile Duncan and myself are more into sweet kind of breakfasts, I know that my brother especially prefers a savoury brekkie. So I’ve been thinking about what I could make for him and this simple vegan breakfast bowl is what I came up with. It’s a dish that marries a lot of leftovers together and it isn’t worse for it.\n\nI used already cooked and cooled potatoes, which I pan-fried in a little olive oil. I charred some cherry toms under a hot grill until they split open and became jammy and delicious (beware as they stay dangerously hot for ages!!). I wilted some spinach that wasn’t fresh enough to put in a salad anymore and finally made vegan scrambled eggs from some silken tofu, flavoured with aromatics and magical black salt, which due to its high sulphur content, makes tofu taste like eggs.\n\nIt may sound very niche and fancy, but it’s a staple of Indian cuisine, so if you live in the UK, a well-stocked Indian-run corner store is a great place to get it. While it’s called black salt (or [kala namak](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak)), it is dusty pink when ground up fine, so keep your eyes open for that. This dish is filling, full of contrasting textures and flavours and super quick to put together. It will make an awesome savoury breakfast or brunch and I am hoping that it will make our non-vegan guests happy.\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl ingredients](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-ingredients.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl potatoes](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-potatoes.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl portion](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-portion-800x1200.jpg)\n\n*   olive oil\n*   a bunch of cherry tomatoes on the vine\n*   250 g / 9 oz cooked and cooled small potatoes, halved\n*   salt to taste\n*   black pepper, to taste\n*   100 g / 3.5 oz baby spinach\n*   1 large shallot, finely diced\n*   1 garlic clove, finely diced\n*   300 g / 10.5 oz silken firm tofu (I use [Clearspring](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/silken-tofu))\n*   ¼ tsp turmeric, adjust to taste\n*   ¼ tsp [black salt](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak) (has eggy taste), adjust to taste\n*   ½ ripe avocado, cut in half\n\nMETHOD\n\n1.  Brush tomatoes with a little oil (keeping them on the vine if you can) and place them on a small baking tray. Stick them under a grill / broiler for 5-10 minutes, until their skins burst and the tops char a little. Season and set aside.\n2.  Heat up 2 tsp of olive oil on a small frying pan. Place cold potatoes, cut side down on the hot oil and allow them to fry gently until nicely browned. Season with salt and pepper.\n3.  Place spinach on another pan with a splash of water. Allow the spinach to wilt using gentle heat. Move it around the pan with a pair of tongs. Season and lift wilted spinach out of the pan, draining any excess water away.\n4.  Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan (I reused the one I used to wilt the spinach) and fry diced shallot and garlic on a very gentle heat.\n5.  Once shallot is translucent and garlic fragrant (but not browned), add the drained tofu. Smash it a little with the back of a spoon. Season with turmeric, black salt (it will give it eggy taste) and pepper.\n6.  Divide all the elements (including the avocado) between two bowls and drizzle with extra olive oil if needed."

They’re just the wonderful result of what happens when you take the basics and then add a twist here and a switcheroo there, all depending on what’s fresh and seasonal and hanging out in the fridge. This chicken spinach salad is exactly one of those recipes and finds itself as my lucky lunch at least once a week.\n\nIt’s loaded with heart healthy baby spinach, sliced sweet strawberries, creamy avocado, and a simple dressing that does double duty as the chicken marinate. Cook the chicken on the stove top or on the grill and you have a salad made for filling lunches or easy dinners.\n\nIsn’t that the perfect reason to share?\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-012.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-012.jpg)\n\nWhat’s in This Strawberry Spinach Salad?\n----------------------------------------\n\nTo make this avocado, spinach, and strawberry chicken salad, you’ll need:\n\n*   Extra virgin olive oil\n*   Golden balsamic vinegar\n*   Sugar\n*   Fresh tarragon\n*   Kosher salt and pepper\n*   Chicken breasts\n*   Fresh spinach\n*   Strawberries\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Feta cheese\n*   Sliced almonds\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-020.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-020.jpg)\n\nHow to Make a Spinach and Strawberry Salad\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhisk together the balsamic dressing and pour half over the chicken. Set the chicken aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes.\n\nOnce the chicken has had time to soak up some flavor, grill until done. Then, it’s just a matter of assembling the strawberry spinach salad and digging in!\n\nCan I Use Another Leafy Green?\n------------------------------\n\nI always have fresh spinach in the fridge, where it finds its way into everything from my [breakfast fritattas](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-and-mushroom-egg-white-frittata/), to my lightened up [sweet green smoothies](https://www.foodiecrush.com/immune-booster-sweet-green-smoothie/) and [spinach lasagna](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-lasagna-roll-ups/).  So it’s a natural base for this hearty salad, that works for lunch or dinner even.\n\nBut if you have kale, arugula, romaine, butter or even spring mix mingling in the crisper, by all means, use it up!\n\nCan I Use Another Berry?\n------------------------\n\nThe ying and yang of sweet strawberries with red onion and avocado is one of my favorite combos ever. However, you can always swap out raspberries or blueberries for the strawberries and instead of feta, give goat cheese a try. I have and likely will again.\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | #spinach #recipe #balsamic #chicken #healthy foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTips for Making Strawberry Spinach Salad\n----------------------------------------\n\n**I like to cook a few chicken breasts on Sunday or Monday** to eat during the week in salads like this. I’ve shared how to cook them on the stove top below, but if you’re ready to grill, [this technique](https://www.foodiecrush.com/the-best-grilled-chicken-breast-recipe-and-a-giveaway/) is always a grilled chicken success.\n\n**This balsamic tarragon dressing is my standard, go-to-all-the-time salad dressings.** I use white balsamic dressing because it’s a bit mellower and doesn’t dominate the flavor of the salad, instead letting all of the other flavors shine through.\n\n**The dressing does double duty as a chicken marinade too.** Remember that after marinating chicken to discard the marinade. You do NOT want to use it for the dressing after soaking in raw chicken.

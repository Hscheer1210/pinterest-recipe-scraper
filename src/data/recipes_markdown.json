This shrimp avocado salad is **healthy, filling, satisfying, and light**. It's a well-balanced meal that combines veggies (avocado and arugula), protein (shrimp), a small amount of your favorite fruit (I used mango), and nuts (I used pine nuts). It's **super-versatile and flexible**, and you can use a wide variety of ingredients and substitutions (see more on that below the recipe card). I've made it so many times this Summer because it definitely became one of my family's most requested salads! This recipe is a great way to dress up and give so much flavor to **the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp**. Or cook raw shrimp from scratch using one of my recipes: [shrimp scampi with capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/) or [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n\nCrowd-pleasing Summer salad\n---------------------------\n\nThis light and refreshing salad takes under 20 minutes to make, which is great for busy weeknights. You only need **6 main ingredients** - shrimp, avocado, spinach, mango, pine nuts, and red onions.  The salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). Shrimp avocado salad also makes a stunning presentation - perfect for sharing with the crowd! **Bring this Summer salad to picnics, potlucks, barbecue parties, and other outdoor Summer festivities.** Or, serve it indoors for those special occasions when you want to impress your guests without spending too much time in the kitchen.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-1-1.jpg \"Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.\")\n\nIs it a healthy salad?\n----------------------\n\n*   **Packed with nutrients.** Shrimp avocado salad combines so many good-for-you ingredients. It's highly nutritious, packed with fiber and protein, and low in calories. It's gluten-free and dairy-free. It's also pescatarian - perfect for vegetarians who incorporate seafood into their diets.  It will make a delicious healthy addition to the list of your family's favorites.\n*   **Shrimp** is naturally low in carbs and rich in protein. It's low-fat but the fat that it does provide is a good kind of fat (beneficial omega-3 fatty acids).\n*   **Avocado** is packed with healthy fats and is a great source of vitamins B6, C,  E, and K. It also provides folate, magnesium, potassium, and copper.\n*   **Mango** is an excellent source of vitamin C.\n*   **Arugula** is rich in Vitamins A, C, and K, and is a great source of calcium, potassium, and folate.\n\n![Shrimp Avocado Salad with Arugula, Pine Nuts, Mango, Red Onion - in a white bowl.](https://juliasalbum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shrimp-Avocado-Salad-recipe-1-1-300x300.jpg)\n\nShrimp Avocado Salad is a quick and easy **Mediterranean-style recipe** that makes a great side salad, lunch, or light dinner.

You can also add baby spinach, mixed greens, or butter lettuce.\n*   **Onions.** I used red onions. Finely chopped green onions work, too.\n*   **Fruit.** You have so many choices here. My personal preference is any type of orange color fruit because it adds such a nice vibrance to this shrimp avocado salad. I recommend mango, peaches, nectarines, and apricots. You can also add citrus fruit which will pair well with shrimp, such as oranges, mandarine oranges, or grapefruit.\n*   **Salad dressing.** The simple salad dressing is made with only 3 ingredients (honey, lime juice, and olive oil). You can also use maple syrup and lemon juice.\n\nTips for Success\n----------------\n\n*   **Use pre-cooked shrimp.** It saves so much time, and this avocado salad is just a great way to dress up the store-bought pre-cooked shrimp.\n*   **Any size of shrimp works.** I do prefer to use large, but this is a great recipe to use up smaller cooked shrimp!\n*   **Cook shrimp from scratch.** If you have raw shrimp, simply cook it on the stovetop. Here is a nice, light recipe for [cilantro-lime shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/).\n*   **Freshly squeezed lime juice** is a must! It's so much better than the bottled kind!\n*   **Note about mango.** The mango should be ripe but not overly ripe and mushy. When buying mango it should have a little give when you press the skin gently. It should not be overly soft. The color should be orange or yellow for at least one-fourth of the fruit's skin. Always peel mangoes.\n\nHow to tell if an avocado is ripe?\n----------------------------------\n\n*   **A ripe avocado** should have a little give when gently pressed. It should not be overly soft - nobody likes over-ripe avocados that turn into mush.\n*   **An unripe avocado** will have no give and will feel almost like a rock when lightly pressed. It will be really hard to cut it and remove the pit.\n\nMake-ahead tips\n---------------\n\n*   If making ahead, don't slice the avocado until ready to serve as it will brown.\n*   Also, add salad dressing last moment to keep everything fresh and not wilted.\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   The shrimp avocado salad can be refrigerated for 2 days. It's best to refrigerate the salad and the dressing separately.\n\nMore shrimp recipes\n-------------------\n\n*   [Garlic Butter Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/garlic-butter-shrimp/)\n*   [Shrimp Scampi with Capers](https://juliasalbum.com/shrimp-scampi/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-shrimp/)\n*   [Honey-Mustard Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/honey-mustard-garlic-shrimp/)\n*   [Lemon Shrimp Orzo](https://juliasalbum.com/lemon-shrimp-orzo-asparagus/)\n*   [Cilantro-Lime and Black Bean Rice Shrimp](https://juliasalbum.com/cilantro-lime-black-bean-shrimp-and-rice/)\n\nOther healthy salads you might like\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   [Apple Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/apple-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Holiday Salad with Spinach, Mandarin Oranges, Pecans, Cranberries, Goat Cheese, and Honey-Mustard Lime Vinaigrette](https://juliasalbum.com/holiday-salad/)\n*   [Peach Blueberry Spinach Salad](https://juliasalbum.com/peach-blueberry-spinach-salad/)\n*   [Berry Spinach Salad with Blueberries, Raspberries, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/berry-spinach-salad-with-blueberries-raspberries/)\n*   [Strawberry Spinach Salad with Feta cheese, Pecans, and Balsamic Dressing](https://juliasalbum.com/strawberry-spinach-salad-recipe/)\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

It’s tossed in a delicious citrus vinaigrette, and is the perfect way to eat more veggies!\n\n![arugula salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1A75F2BE-F73B-4B84-B7DA-4EA275C10086-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**Arugula Citrus Salad**\n------------------------\n\nNow that the weather is starting to get warmer, I’m all about light and fresh salads during the week. This arugula citrus salad is filled with so many feel-good ingredients, and is the perfect lunch to serve as is or with a grilled piece of protein.\n\nIt’s filled with crunchy toasted almonds, fresh orange slices, tricolor quinoa, and hearty chickpeas. The salad is tossed in a homemade citrus vinaigrette, and is seriously the perfect spring salad!\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13FE18F3-23DF-477F-AE22-ECF1609DE7BC-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThere are so many ways to prepare delicious hearty salads, but sometimes they can get repetitive. Here are a few tips to make the best salads at home:\n\n1.  Add a grain- grains add such a hearty component to salads, and can take them from a side dish to a main meal\n2.  Add a crunch- you’ll rarely ever see me eating a salad without some form of nuts or seeds added. They add such a delicious crunch and help give texture to your salads. Toasting the nuts is an extra step, but adds the most rich flavor!\n3.  Add canned beans- canned beans are an affordable way to add more flavor, fiber and protein to your salads. My go-to’s are usually chickpeas and cannellini beans since they’re subtle tasting and work well with so many flavors\n4.  Finish it off with cheese! Whether you use dairy or vegan cheese, the saltiness provides delicious depth of flavor and adds a little more heartiness to your salad\n\n![arugula citrus salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/683056D7-F6A4-4A70-8124-07DE41DDBAD0-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What you’ll need to make this arugula citrus salad:**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Arugula- the arugula keeps this salad light and fresh. It’s the perfect base for this citrus salad\n*   Quinoa- I love adding quinoa to this salad, but other grains that would also work well are farro, barley, or pearled couscous\n*   Avocado- a slightly firm avocado is ideal for any salad since it will keep its shape and still have flavor\n*   Oranges- for added freshness and sweetness\n*   Chickpeas- for a boost of fiber and protein\n*   Crumbled cheese- feta is my go-to for salads, but feel free to swap any cheese of choice\n*   Homemade citrus vinaigrette\n\n![](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06007365-5420-479E-BCE8-C39099F47B57-scaled.jpeg)\n\nThe sweet, salty and savory flavors in this salad work so well together. It’s delicious on its own as a light lunch, but I love serving it with a grilled piece of salmon for an added boost of protein.\n\nThis salad is so simple to make, easily customizable, and is the perfect way to eat more salads this season!\n\n![arugula salad](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/F6E723C9-4EC3-421E-AFFE-633FC3A3AACD-scaled.jpeg)\n\n**What to serve with your arugula citrus salmon:**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Honey Jalapeno Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-jalapeno-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pasta with Roasted Asparagus](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pasta-with-roasted-asparagus/)\n\n### [Honey Za’atar Salmon](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/honey-zaatar-salmon/)\n\n### [Lemon Pepper Tofu](https://somethingnutritiousblog.com/lemon-pepper-tofu/)\n\nArugula Citrus Salad\n--------------------\n\nCourse: Main\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1/2 cup 1/2 uncooked quinoa\n    \n*   1 cup 1 vegetable broth or water\n    \n*   5 oz 5 arugula, about 5-6 cups\n    \n*   1 can 1 chickpeas, drained (15 oz)\n    \n*   2 medium 2 avocados, slightly firm is ideal- cut into cubes\n    \n*   1 1 orange, peeled and chopped\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 slivered almonds\n    \n*   1/2 cup 1/2 crumbled feta cheese\n    \n*   **Citrus Vinaigrette**\n*   1/4 cup 1/4 olive oil\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 orange juice\n    \n*   2 tbsp 2 lemon juice\n    \n*   1 clove 1 garlic, crushed\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 dijon mustard\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 pure maple syrup\n    \n*   1 tbsp 1 chopped red onion or shallots\n    \n*   Salt & pepper\n    \n\n### Directions\n\n*   Add the quinoa and vegetable broth to a sauce pan and bring it to a boil.

Remove the pot from the heat and it let sit for 10 minutes while you prepare your salad ingredients. After 10 minutes, fluff with a fork and season with a little salt.\n*   While the quinoa cooks, add you slivered almonds to a sheet pan and set them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes to toast. Alternatively, you can toast them in a small pan over a medium flame until they start to brown.\n*   Prepare your salad dressing by combining all of the ingredients together.\n*   Add your arugula to a large salad bowl and toss it together with half of the dressing.\n*   Add the quinoa, chickpeas, oranges, avocado, toasted almonds and cheese and top it with the remaining dressing.\n*   Toss to combine and enjoy!\n\n### Did you make this recipe?\n\nTag @somethingnutritious on Instagram- I’d love to see your creations!"

In fact, I didn’t tell anyone I made these because I am selfish like that.\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903_121134-2.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nIf you have never had Delicata Squash, boy oh boy, you are in for a treat, and I highly suggest you get your bottom down to the grocery store right now and grab a couple (or 10).  It’s lighter in flavor than any of the other squashes around.  I don’t know about you guys with kids, but squash is pretty much the only thing that my kids don’t like eating.  Well not delicata.   It is the first thing off their plates.\n\nMy favorite thing about this squash though has to be the fact that you don’t have to peel it.  Yup, that’s right!  You can eat the skin of these bad boys!  Well technically you can eat the skin of any winter squash, but it probably won’t be that tasty.  Don’t worry though, this skin is delicious!\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Roasted-Delicata-Squash.png?resize=640%2C960&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nWhat I love about delicata squash is that you can put ANY seasonings you feel like sprinkling on there and it will be out of this world good.  Here are a few of my favorite seasoning blends for it….\n\n1.  [PRIMAL PALATE](https://www.primalpalate.com/organic-spices/ref/88/) French Onion blend.\n2.  My ranch blend from [HERE](https://pretenditsadonut.com/2018/01/16/sheet-pan-ranch-pork-loin/)\n3.  Salt and dried thyme.\n\nBut my favorite spice blend has to be the one you are about to read in the recipe.  Finger-lickin-wish I had doubled the batch-good.\n\n![ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI](https://i0.wp.com/pretenditsadonut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903_121141-2.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1 \"ROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\")\n\nThese are definitely best eaten right away while they are still warm.  They aren’t terrible cold, but your mouth will be much happier with them straight outta the oven.  I sometimes save some to put in my kids lunches, because I don’t really care if they eat it cold!  And they don’t mind either.  At least I don’t think they mind.  They’ve never complained. So that’s a plus!\n\nROASTED DELICATA SQUASH WITH CHIPOTLE AIOLI\n\nIngredients\n\n*   2 medium Delicata Squash, sliced 1/8 of an inch thick\n*   2 tbl avocado oil\n*   squeeze of lime\n*   Fresh cilantro for garnish\n\nSPICE BLEND:\n\n*   1 tbl paprika\n*   1 1/2 tsp chipotle powder\n*   1 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n*   1 tsp cumin\n*   1 tsp sea salt\n\nCHIPOTLE AIOLI:\n\n*   1/4 cup mayonnaise\n*   1 tsp spice blend\n*   1 tsp lime juice\n\nInstructions\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls - Ev's Eats\n[Jump to Recipe](#mv-creation-94-jtr)\n\nA little magic went down in the kitchen earlier today, and they involve these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls.\n\nCilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin. If that’s not enough, the bowls are then topped with [mango salsa](https://evseats.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-sweet-and-spicy-mango-salsa/) and some sweet fried plantains on the side, perfection.\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-2.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)\n\nThis recipe is special for me as it is near and dear to my heart. One of the reasons I fell in love with cooking was because I always had strong, positive female role models who always took such care and pride in preparing meals for their loved ones. From my grandma, to my mom, down to my aunties they showed me how to put love in food, and how it was the most important ingredient. Recently I lost one of my aunties, and I want to dedicate this post and recipe to her.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of my Aunt was her preparing breakfast for my Uncle and all of her nieces and nephews. She used to make the best sausages, and her kitchen was never dull as she would dance and sing all while cooking. We used to laugh as kids because food used to fly around the kitchen whenever she was in there, and man her food was ALWAYS amazing!\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-9.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nIt’s been tough dealing with losing her, but I take comfort in knowing that she’s always with me especially when I’m in the kitchen. In my culture, we celebrate life and not death. So to celebrate her life and the love of the journey that life takes us all on, I decided to get in the kitchen and whip up these Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls (something I know she would’ve loved) and pour a glass of [Wente Vineyard’s Riva Ranch Chardonnay](https://ooh.li/83923f3) as a toast to her and all the lives she touched.\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-5.jpg?resize=800%2C800&ssl=1)](https://ooh.li/83923f3)\n\nThese bowls are full of life, flavor, and spice just like my aunty. Let me break down the components of yumminess for you!\n\n1.  Cuban Style Chicken- I marinated this chicken in such amazing spices! Cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, chili powder, fresh garlic, lime juice and zest, and orange juice and zest! This chicken is perfect with pretty much anything. In a salad, tacos, sandwiches, etc!  Very similar to my [Mojo Cuban Pork](https://evseats.com/cuban-sandwiches/) recipe, how can you pass up on delicious moist and juicy chicken?!\n2.  Cuban Style Black Beans- Oh! These may just be my favorite part! More amazing flavors of cumin and smoked paprika. I mash half of the beans and mix it all together to keep some texture, and it’s just delicious! I’ve been known to just eat a whole pan of these, lol!\n3.  Cilantro Lime Rice- Okay by now we all know how much I love rice, but this rice is next level!

To a blender, combine the ingredients for the chicken marinade. Add the cumin, chili powder, dried oregano, salt and pepper, 4 cloves garlic, zest and juice of 1 orange, and the zest and juice of 1 lime to the blender. Blend together until everything is finely chopped and smooth.\n2.  Add the chicken to a bowl or a Ziploc bag and pour half the marinade over the chicken. Toss to coat and allow the chicken to sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the marinade.\n3.  Heat a large skillet with vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

Add the remaining marinade to the skillet and cook until it has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.\n\n**Black Beans**\n\n1.  Heat the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the onions and saute for 3-4 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and saute 30-60 seconds. Add the black beans and spices and cook for 5-10 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until soft. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil allowing to toast for about a minute. Add the chicken broth and increase the heat to high, allowing it to come to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and place the lid onthe pan. Cook for about 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has absorbed.\n2.  Turn off the heat and allow rice to sit with the lid on for an additional 5 minutes. Add the lime, cilantro and season with salt and pepper, to taste.\n3.  To serve, divide the cilantro lime rice among bowls. Top with chicken and black beans. Add mango salsa and fried plantains if desired!\n\n###### Nutrition Information:\n\nYield: 4 Serving Size: 1  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 829Total Fat: 22gSaturated Fat: 3gTrans Fat: 0gUnsaturated Fat: 17gCholesterol: 71mgSodium: 1633mgCarbohydrates: 112gFiber: 23gSugar: 21gProtein: 49g\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-pin-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1)\n\n![Cuban Chicken & Black Bean Rice Bowls -Cilantro-lime rice and Cuban style black beans serve as the base for juicy chicken tossed in a blend of fresh orange juice, lime juice, garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, and cumin.](https://i0.wp.com/evseats.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cuban-Chicken-Black-Bean-Rice-Bowls-Pin.jpg?resize=512%2C1024&ssl=1)"

I promise it’s super easy and takes just a few steps! Check out my answers to some common questions below:\n\n**How do you cut up zucchini?**\n\nI recommend cutting zucchini lengthwise into long strips. Remove the ends off the zucchini and cut into 1/3-inch or 1/2-inch slices.\n\nDepending on the size of your zucchini, you’ll end up with 3-4 strips per vegetable.\n\n**Should you salt zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYes! I definitely recommend salting the cut up strips of zucchini prior to grilling them. Simply sprinkle them with salt, then let them sit for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe salt will pull out a lot of the water in the zucchini, which you can pat off before putting them on the grill. This will help prevent a watery mess!\n\n**Do you peel zucchini before grilling?**\n\nNever :). I always suggest to leave the zucchini skins on. The skins of fruits + veggies often contain a TON of the nutrients and fibre. You don’t want to miss out on it!\n\n**Should you oil zucchini before grilling?**\n\nYup! I recommend brushing both sides of each zucchini slice with a little bit of olive or [avocado oil](https://www.walderwellness.com/recommends/avocado-oil/) before placing them on the grill. This helps to prevent the zucchini from drying out and sticking to the grill.\n\n![overhead shot of wood cutting board with zucchini, honey, goat cheese, and basil](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-1-683x1024.jpg)\n\nIs Grilled Zucchini Healthy?\n----------------------------\n\nYou bet! Zucchini is not only delicious, but it’s jam-packed with nutrition benefits, too.\n\nZucchini is rich in many **micronutrients**, like:\n\n*   **vitamin A**\n*   **vitamin C**\n*   **vitamin K**\n*   **vitamin** **B6**\n*   **folate**\n*   **manganese**\n*   **magnesium**\n*   **potassium**\n*   **copper**\n\nThis summer squash is also a great source of **dietary fibre**, with one medium zucchini providing 2 grams or 8% of your daily fibre needs.\n\nLike other fruits and veggies, zucchini is also a great source of **antioxidants**, especially carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin.\n\n![light blue plate with grilled zucchini slices topped with crumbled goat cheese, basil and honey](https://www.walderwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Grilled-Zucchini-With-Goat-Cheese-Basil-Honey-Walder-Wellness-2-683x1024.jpg)\n\nWhat To Pair With Grilled Zucchini\n----------------------------------\n\nNeed some ideas to make this grilled zucchini a full meal?

    "markdown": "# Autumn Harvest Bowl - The Almond Eater\n_This post may contain affiliate links. Read our [disclaimer.](https://thealmondeater.com/contact/privacy-policy/)_ \n\n_This Autumn Harvest Bowl is warm, comforting and filled with healthy ingredients. The base is made with arugula and it's topped with quinoa, sweet potatoes and goat cheese, along with a delicious maple-tahini dressing for tons of flavor!_ \n\n![A bowl of food with Quinoa and Salad](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-1-3.jpg.webp)\n\nBowl food is the best food, and this autumn harvest bowl is perfect this time of year!\n\n \n\nOne of the many reasons why I like bowls like this (and my [vegan burrito bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/vegan-burrito-bowl/ \"Vegan Burrito Bowl\") and my [Mediterranean quinoa bowl](https://thealmondeater.com/mediterranean-quinoa-bowl/ \"Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl\")) is because they're quick and generally filled with healthy ingredients. This bowl in particular is topped with all of the best foods like sweet potato, apple, goat cheese, and the most delicious maple-tahini sauce.\n\nI still remember the first time I tried tahini. Everyone was so obsessed with it, so I had high hopes that I would be too. To be honest, plain tahini doesn't thrill me, but tahini mixed with other things IS SO GOOD. It's a great nut-free dressing or sauce option, and pairs well with so many flavors (in this case, maple syrup!).\n\nWhy you'll love this bowl\n-------------------------\n\n*   It's loaded with vegetables like arugula and sweet potato, but has plenty of protein thanks to the quinoa and chickpeas\n*   The maple tahini sauce is INSANELY good\n*   It can be enjoyed warm or cold (yes really!)\n*   It's quite similar to the harvest bowl from [Sweet Green](https://www.sweetgreen.com/), so think of this as making your own homemade version.\n\n![A bowl filled with different types of food on a plate](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-ingredients.png.webp)\n\nIngredients and substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\n**Arugula:** The base of this bowl should be some sort of greens, and I chose arugula, but other options could be spinach or massaged kale.\n\n**Quinoa:** The quinoa adds a bit of protein to this, but again, any grain works! Rice, farro, barley, etc. would all be delicious.\n\n**Sweet potatoes:** You could also used cubed and cooked butternut squash.\n\n**Cranberries:** Who doesn't love cranberries? They add a little bit of sweetness and scream \"fall\", but you could also use raisins or chopped pitted dates.\n\n**Goat cheese:** Or sub feta cheese\n\nStep-by-step instructions\n-------------------------\n\n**Step 1: Cook the quinoa and sweet potatoes.** You can do this ahead of time if you want to make this even quicker.\n\n**Step 2: Add arugula.** Place arugula in a bowl, then top it with the cooked quinoa. Then, add the remaining salad ingredients.\n\n![A bowl of arugula and quinoa](https://thealmondeater.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Autumn-Harvest-Bowl-11.png.webp)\n\n**Step 3: Make the dressing.** Whisk tahini and maple syrup together, then drizzle it over the salad.\n\nExpert tips\n-----------\n\n*   Don't love arugula? Try using mixed greens or even kale instead.\n\n*   Do NOT to slice the apple until you're ready to eat it.\n\n*   If you don't love maple syrup, you can use honey in the dressing instead.\n\n### What if I want to add meat to this?\n\nYou can! However, since the dressing is maple-tahini, I'm not sure how well that'd pair with most meat.

However, you could also use chicken thighs, but cooking times may vary. When cubing the chicken, try to get them as close in size as possible for even cooking.\n\n**Seasonings:** To season the chicken, you will need paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and pepper.\n\n**[Mayonnaise](https://iamhomesteader.com/homemade-mayonnaise/):** The mayonnaise gives the sauce the creamy texture and richness that bang bang sauce is known for.

If possible, make your own!\n\n**Sriracha:** Sriracha gives the sauce a spicy kick with some heat. You can definitely add more (or use less), depending on how much heat you can handle!\n\n**Honey:** Honey is used to balance out the flavors of the sauce. It adds a natural sweetness that helps to counteract the heat from the Sriracha and balances the tanginess of the Thai sweet chili sauce.\n\n![Raw Bang Bang Chicken Skewers Before Cooking.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-3.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer. They make for a delicious appetizer or main course and can also be made in the oven!\")\n\nBoth wooden and metal skewers can be used when making these bang bang chicken skewers, even in the air fryer. If using wooden skewers, be sure they are soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before using them. Soaking them in water prevents the skewers from charring during cooking. If using metal skewers, make sure they fit in the basket of your air fryer. If using wooden skewers, you can break them in half if you need to shorten them.\n\n![Hand Holding One Bang Bang Chicken Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bangchicken.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer. They make for a delicious appetizer or main course and can also be made in the oven!\")\n\nCan I Make Bang Bang Chicken Skewers Ahead Of Time?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nYes! You can get the seasoned chicken skewers assembled ahead of time as well as make the bang bang sauce in advance. Once you have the chicken on the skewers, you can store them in the refrigerator or freeze them before cooking. If stored in the refrigerator, they will last 2-3 days, covered. These can also be frozen ahead of time. To freeze, tightly wrap the chicken skewers; they will last in the freezer for up to 3 months. When ready to cook them, let the skewers thaw in the refrigerator overnight. The bang bang sauce can be mixed together and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\n\n![Bang Bang Chicken Skewers on Parchment with a Few Pieces of Chicken not on the Skewer.](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bang-chicken-6.jpg \"Bang Bang Chicken Skewers is a quick, easy, and flavorful recipe made with seasoned cubed chicken brushed with homemade bang bang sauce, cooked in an air fryer. They make for a delicious appetizer or main course and can also be made in the oven!\")\n\nStoring & Reheating Bang Bang Chicken Skewers\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any leftover chicken skewers, store the skewers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. (If preferred, you can remove the chicken from the skewers when storing.) Reheat them in the oven, microwave, or in a skillet on the stovetop. Store the leftover reserved bang bang sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Brush it over the reheated chicken.\n\n*   ▢ wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes\n\n#### Chicken\n\n*   ▢ 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon black pepper\n\n*   In a large bowl, combine the cubed chicken breasts, oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to evenly coat the chicken.\n    \n*   Working one skewer at a time, thread 4-5 chicken cubes onto each.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce, Sriracha, and honey. Mix well. This will make about 1 ¾ cups bang bang sauce.\n    \n*   Pour half of the sauce into a separate bowl and set aside to use after the chicken has been cooked. Use the rest of the sauce to brush evenly over the chicken.\n    \n*   Add the skewers to the basket of your air fryer in a single layer. (Depending on the size of the air fryer, you may have to work in batches.)\n    \n*   Air fry\\* at 400°F for 11-12 minutes, flipping halfway. Chicken is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n    \n*   Transfer the skewers to a plate and drizzle or brush with the reserved bang bang sauce. Serve immediately.\n    \n\n**\\*Oven and Grilling Instructions:**\n\n**Oven:**\n\n1.  Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2.  Place the seasoned cubes of chicken onto the skewers, then onto the lined baking sheet. (Do not brush the chicken with bang bang sauce until after baking in the oven.)\n3.  Cook the chicken skewers for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n4.  Remove from the oven. Brush with the bang bang sauce and serve.\n\n**Grill:**\n\n1.  Thread the seasoned chicken onto the skewers. (Wait until after grilling to brush with the bang bang sauce.) Grill over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes per side, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.\n2.  Brush the grilled chicken with the bang bang sauce.\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n\nYou can tag me at @iamhomesteader.\n\nWhat the **Test Kitchen** had to say about this recipe:\n\n![](https://iamhomesteader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8710-343x343.jpg)\n\nAutumn\n\nIf you are looking for a simple dish that packs some serious flavor, this one is for you.

The opinions and text are all mine._\n\nDoes the cold weather make you just crave comfort food?  I know it does that to me.  And although I have plenty of room on my meal plan for [warm soups](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/), [cheesy pasta](https://www.foxandbriar.com/one-pot-pasta-bake-sausage-wine/) and all other kinds of comfort food, sometimes I want to keep it healthier and focus on fruits and veggies.  As I shared before with my [Roasted Shrimp, Fennel and Grapefruit Kale Salad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/roasted-shrimp-fennel-and-grapefruit-kale-salad/), I like my cool weather salads to be bulked up with roasted veggies and grains.  Here I have kept the farro and kale, but added roasted delicata squash and pomegranate aerials for that sweet tart zing.  Once again, my local Fred Meyer came through for me by having all the ingredients I needed for this salad, including these gorgeous pomegranates.\n\n[Jump to recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/autumn-harvest-salad-with-pomegranates/#recipe)\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

In the recipe card below, you’ll find a go-to dough recipe that I use for all types of flatbread and pizza recipes. In fact, I even used this same dough recipe in my [**_Wrapped Asparagus Spears_**](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wrapped-asparagus-spears-with-garlic-butter-and-parmesan/) recipe. It’s a completely versatile and adaptable dough.\n\nThere are several types of bread that can fall into the flatbread category. Some of them have yeast and some don’t. I tend to like a little bit of yeast in my flatbread and pizza dough. Not so much that it puffs up a lot, just enough so that it’s more substantial.\n\nMake your own online recipe box!\n--------------------------------\n\n**Click the in the lower right corner of your screen  \n& follow the quick and easy instructions!**\n\n### FLATBREAD OPTIONS\n\nIf you’re not feeling up to making your own dough at home, you can certainly buy pre-made flatbread and still make a great-tasting dinner. I have often purchased flatbread at the grocer and topped it with sauce, cheese, and our favourite toppings. It’s a great way to whip up dinner in a hurry. And, it’s a lot cheaper than pizza delivery!\n\nThis recipe will work perfectly with focaccia, even though it’s a very thick type of flatbread. Naan works very well! Roti will work well too, especially if you’re looking for unleavened bread. (Unleavened is a term that applies to breads that do not include an ingredient such as yeast which makes the bread rise and proof. Most flat types of bread and unleavened breads.)\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

I had made up a double batch of the dough a little while ago and decided to make a **_[Traditional Newfoundland Pizza](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/homemade-newfoundland-pizza/)_** for myself and McKenna. I knew John.e wouldn’t eat it, because Newfie pizza is a far cry from being vegetarian.\n\nArmed with black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta, I decided to make a Mediterranean-style flatbread for him. If you’ve been a reader of this blog for any serious amount of time, you would have known that this flatbread wasn’t for me as soon as you looked at the photographs.\n\nI refuse to eat black olives, but John.e loves them. To date, there are over 500 recipes here at Lord Byron’s Kitchen, and this is only the second recipe that features black olives. My [**_Warm Farro Salad_**](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/warm-farro-salad/) has black olives in it too. I can’t make _all_ of the recipes for myself. I have to be nice and make a recipe or two with ingredients that I don’t really care for, right?\n\n### CHANGE IT UP; MAKE IT YOUR OWN!\n\nNow, just because this particular flatbread is modelled after common Mediterranean ingredients, that doesn’t mean you are stuck making your version the exact same way. You can add any toppings you like to your flatbread. You can even make one very large flatbread or two smaller ones like I made.\n\nMost kids are picky eaters, so you might want to change up the black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta. I’ve used this same technique described in the recipe card and added just cheese and pepperoni on many occasions. The recipe is very forgiving and completely adaptable.\n\nIf by chance you or your family cannot finish the flatbread – no worries! Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread can be saved and reheated later. Let the flatbread completely cool and then refrigerate. When ready to reheat, wrap loosely in aluminum foil and bake for 5-7 minutes in a 350-degree preheated oven.\n\nThe aluminum foil should not touch the top of the pizza but should cover it. This will prevent the toppings from burning, and will also prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil. If you freeze the leftovers, allow the flatbread to thaw completely at room temperature before attempting to reheat.\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

For exact amounts and measurements, refer to the printable recipe card located near the bottom of this post.\n\n#### FOR THE DOUGH:\n\n*   **_Active Dry Yeast_** – Do not confuse this with Instant Yeast. Active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water before using, while instant yeast can be mixed right into dry ingredients.\n*   **_Olive Oil_** – You can also use vegetable, canola, avocado oil, etc.\n*   **_Sugar_** – This might seem odd, but the sugar makes for a tastier dough, plus, it gives the yeast something to feed on which promotes proofing or rising.\n*   **_Flour_** – I only ever used all-purpose unbleached flour in my dough. I have not experimented with other flour options at this point.\n*   **_Warm Water_** – The water should be as close to 110 degrees F as possible. Too hot and you will kill the yeast; too cold and it won’t activate properly.\n*   **_Salt_**\n\n#### Lord Byron’s Notes\n\nActive Dry Yeast and Instant Yeast are essentially the same thing and both of them will give you the same result in the end. The difference is that active dry yeast works more slowly than instant yeast and is often used in recipes where water is mixed with the yeast to activate it before the dry ingredients are added to prepare the dough. In contrast, instant yeast works much faster and does not need to be activated by water. It is almost always mixed right into the dry ingredients.\n\n**Scroll down to the comment section and write me a message.**\n\n_I will personally respond as soon as possible!_\n\n#### FOR THE TOPPINGS:\n\nThese toppings are just suggestions. You can change it up and make a flatbread that suits your personal tastes.\n\n*   **_Mozzarella_** – Use fresh mozzarella and slice it about 1/4 inch thick.\n*   **_Sun Dried Tomatoes_** – Use the ones packed in oil. They have better flavour.\n*   **_Black Olives_** – I do not like olives at all, but I made this flatbread for John.e and he loves them. You can use green or none at all if that’s what pleases you.\n*   **_Feta_** – I love crumbled feta on flatbread, especially when it is a Mediterranean-inspired flatbread!\n*   **_Dried Herbs_** – Basil and oregano are perfect on this one!\n*   **_Parsley_** – Used for garnish and is optional.\n*   **_Egg_** – Beat with a little bit of water, this is used to brush the outside of the dough. It helps to brown the dough so that it looks better. You can skip this too if you wish.\n*   **_Non-stick Cooking Spray_**\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

If you have purchased dough from the grocer, follow the instructions on the package. Otherwise, make the dough from scratch by following these simple instructions.\n\nFill a mixing bowl with hot tap water. This will temper the bowl which is important to yeast activation and growth. Measure out 3/4 cup of water that’s 110 degrees F. Pour the water out of the bowl. Place one teaspoon of sugar into the bottom of the bowl and pour over the 3/4 cup of water. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water and let sit for two minutes.\n\nNext, whisk in the olive oil. Add the flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir the flour into the water and oil. Use your hand to knead the dough until it forms a smooth ball. Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside to rise. (Be sure to keep away from drafts or an open window.)\n\n![](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-800x533.jpg)\n\n#### Now, the fun part! Let’s assemble the flatbread!\n\nOnce the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F, and lightly spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Using only half of the dough per sheet pan, place the dough onto the pan and use a rolling pin to roll it out into an oblong or rectangular shape.\n\nNext, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough. Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n\nNext, top each pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta. Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano. Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if you are using it, and slice the flatbread into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes! Simply change the toppings to suit your preferences! #flatbread #pizza #Mediterranean #homemade #recipe](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6-1-533x800.jpg)\n\n### RECIPE TIPS & TRICKS\n\nThe key to a really good flatbread is the dough. You can use the dough recipe here and create any flavour of flatbread that you want. I have made this same dough and spread sun-dried tomato pesto on it with some mozzarella and pepperoni for a make-at-home pizza. I’ve also mixed together equal parts butter and parmesan cheese with a clove of minced garlic and a little splash of olive oil. Spread it over the dough and bake until bubbly. You now have easy garlic fingers! Be sure to dip them in my **_[Donair Sauce](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/newfoundland-donair-sauce/)_**!\n\nYou can also make the dough ahead of time. Once the dough has had time to rise, transfer it to a food-safe plastic bag. Get as much air out of the bag as possible and place the dough in the refrigerator. The dough will last in the fridge for 3-5 days. Once you’re ready to make your flatbread, remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out just like the recipe instructions indicate.\n\nIf you have any leftover flatbread, you can refrigerate it for 2-3 days and reheat it later. You can microwave it, but be sure to do so on half speed/power, otherwise, the crust gets a little chewy. You can also place the flatbread on a baking sheet and toss it in the oven. Set the oven to 200 degrees F and let it go for 5 minutes.\n\n### SERVING SUGGESTIONS\n\nIf you follow my Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread recipe exactly as written, you might want to continue the theme if you are looking to feed a larger group of people. I do this simply by adding side dishes that will complement the main. In the case of this flatbread, I would serve it with this **_[Greek Potato Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/greek-potato-salad/)_** or this **_[Cucumber Walnut Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/cucumber-walnut-salad/)_** or this **_[Fire Roasted Tomato and Artichoke Bean Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/fire-roasted-tomato-artichoke-bean-skillet/)_**!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

This will temper the bowl and help to ensure the yeast will properly activate. While you’re waiting for the bowl to warm, preheat the oven to 500 degrees – not broil, but degrees.\n    \n*   Pour the hot water out of the bowl and wipe the bowl dry. Add the warm tap water and the yeast. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the yeast into the water for no more than 5-10 seconds. Set aside and let the yeast bubble and foam for at least 3 minutes.\n    \n*   Sift together 2 cups of the flour, salt, and sugar.\n    \n*   Add the olive oil to the yeast and water mixture. Stir for a few seconds. Pour in the entire flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed.\n    \n*   Sprinkle your clean countertop with a little flour and empty the dough out. Knead the dough together for 4-5 minutes until a dough ball is formed. Place the dough back into the metal mixing bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and set the bowl on top of your preheating oven. (Don't place the bowl on a burner, just on the surface of the oven. The heat will help the dough to proof/rise.) Let the dough sit for five minutes.\n    \n\n#### For the Pizza:\n\n*   Lightly spray two small baking sheets or pizza pans with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.\n    \n*   When the dough is ready, lightly flour a flat surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a rectangular shape about the size of your pan.  Place the dough onto the baking sheet and push the dough into the corners and up to the sides. This does not need to be perfectly round or rectangular. Just be sure the dough is evenly flattened. (Repeat with the other half of the dough on a second baking sheet or pizza pan.)\n    \n*   Next, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough.\n    \n*   Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n    \n*   Next, top each pizza with the sun dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta.\n    \n*   Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano.\n    \n*   Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if using, and slice into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n    \n\nCalories: 662kcal | Carbohydrates: 63g | Protein: 30g | Fat: 33g | Saturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 135mg | Sodium: 1315mg | Potassium: 408mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 935IU | Vitamin C: 15.3mg | Calcium: 539mg | Iron: 4.9mg\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n-------------------------\n\nUpload a photo and tag me so that I can see it!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

    "markdown": "# 10-Minute Peach & Burrata Salad - Well Seasoned Studio\nIf there’s one dish we have on repeat all summer long, it’s for sure this light, refreshing **peach burrata salad!** Stone fruit season lasts roughly from June till September, so make this as often as you can — even though peaches are available year round in most places, they are **sweetest and juiciest** while in season! **Combine fresh peaches with room temperature burrata cheese** (room temp is key!) **and thinly sliced prosciutto**. This on its own would be heaven, but we’re adding **truffle oil** which makes this a next level peach salad, m’kay!\n\nHere’s why we love this salad so much:\n\n*   Makes for an **easy, light lunch!** It won’t weigh you down, but is so completely satisfying you’ll want to enjoy it every day!\n*   **No cooking required!** We adore a no cook lunch, especially when we’re busy.\n*   **Flavorrrr!** Fresh peaches, creamy burrata cheese, and silky prosciutto — when combined together, well… _swoon!_ Because there are so few ingredients, buy high quality for the best flavor.\n*   **Truffle oil!** Adding a drizzle of truffle oil to the salad is the perfect _je ne sais quoi_ that brings the ingredients together harmoniously. Finish it all off with flaky sea salt and black pepper, and you’ve got one hell of a salad!\n\nBe sure to try our [Grilled Peach Salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-peach-salad/) next or check out all our **[easy salad recipes](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/recipes/salad/).** If you’ve got any leftover peaches, give our [Peach Crumble](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/peach-crumble/) a try for dessert!\n\n![Ingredients for peach burrata truffle salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ingredients-for-peach-burrata-truffle-salad-683x1024.jpeg)\n\nIngredient Notes\n----------------\n\n*   Ripe peaches, _either freestone or clingstone_\n*   Burrata cheese, _room temperature_\n*   Prosciutto (_optional, but highly recommended!_)\n*   [Truffle oil](https://amzn.to/3xtHbcG)\n*   Basil\n*   [Flaky sea salt](https://amzn.to/3gDkoV0)\n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n\nYou can use any type of peach you like best (or just grab whatever is ripe and smells sweetest at the store!). When you’re making a dish with so few ingredients, it’s important to select high quality items. Make sure the peaches aren’t bruised or discolored. Buy fresh, creamy burrata cheese. And if you can get prosciutto from an Italian deli (or even behind the deli counter!), it’ll be 10x better than what comes in a package.\n\n![How to assemble a peach salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/How-to-assemble-a-peach-salad-1024x1020.jpg)\n\nHow To Make An Epic Peach Burrata Salad\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cut the peaches.** If using a **freestone peach**, use a knife to cut all the way around the fruit, ensuring that the knife is touching the pit the entire time. Use your hands to separate the halves from each other, then gently lift away the pit and discard. Cut each peach halve into slices about ½” thick. If using a **clingstone peach**, you’ll cut the peach the same way, but the pit will be more stubborn to remove. Use a [paring knife](https://amzn.to/3q5nQMx) to help separate the pit from the flesh of the peach, then pull the pit out and discard.\n2.  **Arrange the prosciutto.** Rip the prosciutto into small pieces, then arrange nestled in between the peaches.\n3.  **Rip the burrata.** Use your hands to gently tear the burrata into small bite size pieces, being careful to keep a bit of the creamy filling with each bite. Scatter around the plate.\n4.  **Season the salad.** Drizzle the entirely plate lightly with about 1 Tbsp of truffle oil (a little goes a long way), then season the peach slices and burrata with flaky sea salt and black pepper. Garnish with a few fresh basil leaves, then serve immediately.\n\n![Peach and burrata salad with prosciutto on a gray plate with fork.](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Peach-and-burrata-salad-with-prosciutto-on-a-gray-plate-with-fork.jpg)\n\nFAQs\n----\n\n**Freestone vs Clingstone peaches — what’s the difference?**\n\nThis refers to how much the fruit clings to the stone, or pit, of the peach. Freestone peaches have pits that easily life away, while clingstone peaches hold onto the pit more. For a sweet peach that you can eat out of hand, look for a **freestone.** Once exposed, the put will fall away easily. **Clingstone,** however, are sweeter and juicier!\n\n**What is burrata cheese?**\n\nIt’s a soft cow’s milk cheese that looks deceptively like mozzarella. In fact, that’s what the outer layer is! The inside is filled with straciatella and cream, and has a luxurious soft, wet texture. Check out our [braised beef pappardelle](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/braised-beef-pappardelle/), [burrata pizza](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/burrata-pizza/), and [grilled potato salad](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/grilled-potato-salad/), all featuring our favorite cheese: burrata!\n\n**Can I use mozzarella in place of burrata?**\n\nMozzarella won’t have the same creamy texture, but of course you can use it! We recommend tearing a freshly made ball of mozzarella into small bite size pieces. The pre-shredded or packaged cheeses won’t be as good here.\n\n**Truffle oil is expensive. Can I use something else?**\n\nThe truffle oil is really the signature flavor of this dish, so we think it’s worth it. If you don’t like or can’t find truffle oil, replace with a generous drizzle of a high quality finishing oil. [This](https://amzn.to/3iWPOsp) is our favorite!\n\n![Peach salad with basil and prosciutto on a plate](https://www.wellseasonedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Peach-salad-with-basil-and-prosciutto-on-a-plate-683x1024.jpg)\n\n**[Don’t forget to pin this for later!](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/24699497946669429/)**\n\nNot sure how many times we need to say this, but _damn,_ is this salad amazing!

This parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower checks both of those boxes and the flavor is next level!\n\n ![ingredients for Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-ingredients-photo.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients For Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Cauliflower\n*   Pesto\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Lemon\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower with a bowl of pesto with a spoon in it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-photographs.jpg)\n\nThis side dish couldn’t be easier to make. Start by preheating your oven to 400° F. Rinse and dry the head of cauliflower and then cut out the core. Break it down into florets and put them on a rimmed sheet pan.\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with any cleanup, line your sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Lay the cauliflower florets onto the sheet pan. \n\nDollop on 3 or 4 tablespoons of pesto depending on how large your head of cauliflower was. Sprinkle with salt and pepper as well. \n\nUse clean hands to toss the cauliflower until all the florets are coated with pesto. Spread them out into a single layer and make sure there is some space in between them. This will allow them to brown and caramelize rather than steam.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-process-photo.jpg)\n\nRoast the pesto cauliflower for 10 minutes and then remove it from the oven. Use a spatula to toss it around and then sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Roast for another another 12-15 minutes or until it’s tender and caramelized.\n\nRemove it from the oven and squeeze the juice of half of a lemon all over it. Put it on a serving platter or in a bowl. I like to scrape up any of the crispy parmesan cheese that’s stuck to the pan and add it in. \n\nDollop on additional pesto and sprinkle on extra parmesan cheese if you’d like. \n\n ![spoon drizzling pesto on top of Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-picture.jpg)\n\n**Tips For Roasting Cauliflower**\n---------------------------------\n\n*   Roast the cauliflower at a high heat. I like to roast mine at 400° F., but you can also roast at 425° F. Just keep an eye on it as it likely won’t take as long to roast.\n*   Slice the cauliflower so that there are plenty of flat edges. Make sure the flat edges are in contact with the bottom of the pan. This will ensure that they get golden brown and caramelized on that side.\n*   Don’t overcrowd the pan. If the cauliflower is too close together or on top of each other it will steam and won’t get any of the crisp edges or caramelization.\n*   Be sure the cauliflower is completely coated in oil or in this case pesto. Pesto contains olive oil which is why I didn’t add any additional oil to this recipe. \n*   Flip the florets over with a spatula halfway through the cooking time. This will help to caramelize more surface area of the florets.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto.

    "markdown": "# Blackberry Salad (With a Poppyseed Dressing) - Chelsea's Messy Apron\n_Show-stopping **Blackberry Salad** is brimming with juicy blackberries(of course!), sweet candied pecans, crisp pears, salty feta cheese, and a homemade creamy poppy seed dressing._\n\n ![Blackberry salad with a light drizzle of poppy seed dressing, ready to be savored.](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blackberry-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nBlackberry Salad is a stunning dish that tastes every bit as amazing as it looks! It’s got all the right flavors, textures, and the perfect creamy dressing to finish it all off. \n\nWe enjoy this salad as a side dish, but it can be made into a main course meal by adding in some protein. Grilled and chopped chicken, thinly sliced steak, or even some lentils or quinoa would add plenty of protein and make it filling enough for a full meal. In fact, one of our favorite ways to enjoy Blackberry Salad is with some shredded rotisserie chicken added in.\n\n ![Ingredients being added into a blender jar, processed until smooth, with poppy seeds mixed in, and the final dressing being poured.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad tips\n---------------------\n\n*   When serving Blackberry Salad for a party, event, or holiday meal, I recommend **making the candied pecans and dressing a day or two in advance**. This makes the final assembly a breeze! It’s also a good idea so the pecans have sufficient time to harden and the dressing has a chance to thoroughly chill and for the flavors to intensify.\n*   Use a **good mayonnaise for the dressing–** the better the mayo, the better the dressing will taste. I love Hellman’s/Best Foods® (not sponsored) since it has a rich flavor without being too sweet or tangy.\n*   If you aren’t able to find **fresh or ripe pears** at the store, use whole canned pears and drain them. Thinly slice and use in the salad.\n*   Speaking of ripe pears, you can **test a pear for ripeness** by applying gentle pressure near the stem end. If there is a slight give, it is most likely ready to be sliced and added to the salad. And if you can’t smell any sweet pear-ness, it probably isn’t ready to use.\n*   If you have a fresh lemon on hand, squeeze a bit of **lemon juice on the pear to keep it from browning too quickly**. [Here are a few more tips for preparing the pears](https://usapears.org/pear-ripening-and-handling/).\n\n ![Thin slices of pears and fresh blackberries prepared for a salad, with added feta cheese, leading to the salad's final assembly.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201385'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow to use leftover candied pecans\n----------------------------------\n\nSince it’s a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them. You can certainly halve the recipe or purchase pecans that have already been candied (or sugar roasted) at the store.\n\nHere are some of our favorite ways to use up leftover pecans from this Blackberry Salad:\n\n*   As a **snack**/**dessert**: Enjoy them plain or coarsely chopped as a topping for a [Yogurt Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/top-10-favorite-ways-top-yogurt-bowl/) or an [Acai Bowl](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/acai-bowl/)\n*   **In these sweet** **recipes**: [Carrot Cake](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-carrot-cake/) or [Carrot Cake Cupcakes](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/carrot-cake-cupcakes/)\n*   **In these savory** **recipes**: [Pear Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/candied-pecan-pear-pomegranate-salad/), [Butternut Squash Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/butternut-squash-salad/), our favorite [Berry Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/berry-salad-with-a-raspberry-vinaigrette/), or this Fall [Spinach Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spinach-salad/). \n*   **By replacing the regular pecans for candied pecans in these recipes**: [Chicken Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-salad/), [Mexican Wedding Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/mexican-wedding-cookies/), or these [Chocolate Chip Snowball Cookies](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chocolate-chip-snowball-cookies/)\n\nYou can store leftover pecans in the freezer (in an airtight container) for up to 2 months. They only need 10-15 minutes at room temperature to thaw enough to eat. (At room temperature, candied pecans last for up to 2 weeks stored in a cool and dry space.)\n\n ![Blackberry salad featuring a drizzle of poppy seed dressing over a mix of blackberries, nuts, greens, and cheese.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBlackberry Salad storage\n------------------------\n\nBlackberry Salad doesn’t sit or store well once dressed. Once you assemble it, plan to eat it soon; otherwise, the dressing wilts the lettuce, the pears begin to brown, and the pecans soften.\n\nIf you make Blackberry Salad in advance, store all the components separately. Slice the pear and assemble the salad right before eating.\n\nMore salad recipes\n------------------\n\n*   [Beet and Goat Cheese Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/beet-and-goat-cheese-salad/) _with an orange-honey vinaigrette_\n*   [Olive Garden Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/spiralized-cucumber-salad-with-olive-garden-dressing-copycat-video/) _with an Italian vinaigrette_\n*   [Chicken Taco Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/chicken-taco-salad/) _with a cilantro-lime vinaigrette_\n*   [Cucumber Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/cucumber-salad/) _with a balsamic vinaigrette_\n*   [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/) _on a spring Cobb salad_\n\n### Salad\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups (5 oz) spring lettuce mix (8 cups is loosely measured)\n*   ▢ 1 package (6 oz.) fresh blackberries\n*   ▢ 2 Anjou pears, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup chopped candied pecans (recipe for a full batch below)\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup crumbled goat or feta cheese\n\n### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup regular (full fat) mayo (I recommend Best Foods/Hellmans)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons EACH: whole milk, heavy cream, white granulated sugar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n*   ▢ pinch of sea salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon poppy seeds\n\n### Candied Pecans (Note 1)\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup white sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n*   ▢ 1 large egg white\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n*   ▢ 1/2 tablespoon water\n*   ▢ 1 pound pecan halves\n\n#### Poppyseed Dressing\n\n*   Combine all of the dressing ingredients, except the poppy seeds, in a blender and process until combined. Taste and adjust any flavors to personal preference. If you'd like a sweeter dressing, add an additional 1-2 teaspoons white sugar. Stir in the poppy seeds. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to serve. (Dressing stays good for 1 week stored in an airtight container in the fridge.)\n    \n\n#### Candied Pecans\n\n*   Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the white sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Stir to combine.\n    \n*   In another bowl, whisk the egg whites, vanilla, and water until frothy. Toss the pecans into this mixture and then remove, using a slotted spoon. Put the nuts into the sugar mixture and toss until well coated. Spread coated pecans onto a baking sheet.\n    \n*   Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are evenly browned. This takes about 45-60 minutes total. Let stand for 30-45 minutes to allow the pecans to fully cool and solidify. Coarsely chop for the salad.\n    \n\n#### For the Salad\n\n*   In a large salad bowl, toss together the spring lettuce mix and fresh (washed and completely dried) blackberries. Thinly slice pears. Add to the salad.\n    \n*   Add the chopped candied pecans, goat or feta cheese, and the dressing. (You may not want all of the dressing on the salad, so add to personal preference.) Toss and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Note 1**: Prep/cook time doesn't include the preparation of the candied pecans.\n\nSince it's a bit impractical to make a tiny batch of candied pecans for this salad, I include the directions for making about one pound of them.

Everything gets tossed in a creamy maple tahini dressing and every bite is just magical. Here’s what you’ll need to make the salad:\n\n*   **Carrots:** you’ll start by grilling a few halved, large carrots so that they have those pretty grill marks. You’ll need some avocado or [olive oil](https://amzn.to/3nATNf7), salt and pepper.\n*   **Arugula:** the base of this salad is zippy, deliciously peppery arugula. It helps to balance all of the other mix-ins and the dressing.\n*   **Mix-ins:** we’re adding [dried fig halves](https://amzn.to/3yE6RqA) for sweetness, [walnut halves](https://amzn.to/3R21GId) for crunch, goat cheese for a little tang and savory flavor, and avocado for that amazing creaminess.\n*   **For the dressing:** tie the whole salad together with a dressing made with [tahini](https://amzn.to/3xJk6Ip), lemon juice, [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/3nygTD9), a little [dijon mustard](https://amzn.to/3ydAuNT), [garlic powder](https://amzn.to/3IeEWAM), salt & pepper.

Here’s what I can recommend:\n\n*   **Choose your mix-ins:** feel free to pick whatever mix-ins sound good to you like dried cranberries or dates, pecan halves, and feta cheese.\n*   **Add a boost of protein:** make the salad even more filling with 1/2 cup roasted chickpeas, grilled chicken or shrimp.\n*   **Pick your base:** I love the combo of carrots and arugula, but you could also grill sliced sweet potatoes and/or use a mixed green or spinach base.\n*   **Make it dairy free, vegan and/or paleo:** simply leave off the goat cheese! The salad will still be delicious.\n\n![drizzling a grilled carrot salad with tahini dressing](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Grilled-Carrot-Avocado-Fig-Arugula-Salad-2.jpg \"Beautiful grilled carrot arugula salad with sweet dried figs, tangy goat cheese, creamy avocado and crunchy walnuts.

Start by tossing the carrots in avocado oil, salt & pepper, then:\n\n*   **To grill:** place the halved carrots directly on the grill and grill them at medium high heat (about 400 degrees F) for 15-25 minutes total or until slightly tender, flipping halfway through.\n*   **To roast:** add the carrots to a [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3yG7xM9) lined with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/3ukfbZK) and roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender.\n\n![carrot arugula salad with avocado on a platter](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Grilled-Carrot-Avocado-Fig-Arugula-Salad-4.jpg \"Beautiful grilled carrot arugula salad with sweet dried figs, tangy goat cheese, creamy avocado and crunchy walnuts.

Drizzle this fresh arugula and carrot salad with a flavorful maple tahini dressing for a wonderful lunch or easy side dish! Options to grill or roast the carrots for ease.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   **For the carrots:**\n*   4 large carrots, cut in half vertically and stems/tops removed\n*   1 tablespoon avocado oil\n*   Freshly ground salt and pepper\n*   **For the salad:**\n*   5 ounces baby arugula\n*   ¾ cup dried fig halves\n*   ⅓ cup walnuts halves and pieces\n*   ⅓ cup goat cheese crumbles\n*   1 avocado, sliced\n*   ½ cup roasted chickpeas (optional, for extra protein)\n*   **Maple Tahini Dressing:**\n*   ¼ cup drippy tahini (I always use Soom Tahini)\n*   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n*   1-2 teaspoons pure maple syrup\n*   ½ teaspoon dijon mustard\n*   ¼ teaspoon garlic powder\n*   2-3 tablespoons warm water, to thin out a bit\n*   ¼ teaspoon salt\n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n\n### Instructions\n\n*   Add vertically cut carrots to a large bowl or a platter and drizzle with avocado oil then season with freshly ground salt and pepper. Use tongs or clean hands to coat the carrots with the oil.\n    \n*   Preheat the grill to medium high heat (about 400 degrees F) and grill the carrots for 15-25 minutes total or until slightly tender, flipping halfway through. Please note, if you don’t want to grill your carrots, you can roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n    \n*   Toast walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n    \n*   While the carrots are cooking you can make your dressing: in a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, dijon, garlic powder, water (1 tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency) and salt and pepper. Set aside.\n    \n*   Add arugula to a large platter (or you can keep it in a large bowl) and then layer with the toppings: grilled carrots, dried fig halves, toasted walnuts, goat cheese crumbles, avocado slices, and roasted chickpeas (if using).\n    \n*   Drizzle tahini dressing all over the top and season with freshly ground salt and pepper. Divide into bowls and enjoy! Salad keeps well for 2-4 days. Serves 4 as a main and 6 as a side salad.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**To roast the carrots:** add the carrots to a [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3yG7xM9) lined with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/3ukfbZK) and roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender.\n\nIf you’re not into a tahini dressing, I suggest my simple light maple apple cider vinaigrette for this salad. You can toss it with the arugula first or simply place it on the side and have guests drizzle over their salad before serving: 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey and freshly ground salt and pepper to taste.\n\nSee the full post for delicious & easy ways to customize your salad!\n\n### Nutrition\n\nServing: 1serving (based on 4)Calories: 421calCarbohydrates: 32.8gProtein: 11.7gFat: 28.7gSaturated Fat: 6gFiber: 5.9gSugar: 20.5g\n\nRecipe by: Monique Volz // Ambitious Kitchen | Photography by: [Eat Love Eats](https://eatloveeats.com/)\n\n_This post was originally published on July 5th, 2022, and republished on March 13th, 2024._"

    "markdown": "# Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps. - Half Baked Harvest\nThis post may contain affiliate links, please see our [privacy policy](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/privacy-policy/) for details.\n\nThis Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wrap is the perfect wrap to enjoy for lunch or dinner. Grilled chicken wrapped up with Caesar salad tossed greens, avocado, bacon, and basil pesto. This colorful grilled chicken wrap is simple to make, wholesome, and delicious. Use leftover grilled chicken or make my spicy black pepper chicken on the grill. The wraps are great either way and yummy served warmed or chilled.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-1.jpg)\n\nCan you believe this is basically the first wrap recipe I’ve ever shared? I’ve avoided things like wraps and burritos for the longest time. And for the silliest reason…they’re hard for me to photograph. I know, how dumb, but we all have our hang-ups in life.\n\nBut I’m moving beyond and embracing wraps this summer. They feel new and exciting to me and that’s just what I need. New, fun, and exciting.\n\nI made these the very last day before heading off to LA the other week. I wasn’t planning on being able to get these done in time. But I really wanted to try so that I’d be able to share them ahead of Memorial Day weekend. And I am so glad I did! They’re perfect for using up any leftover chicken or for grilling up on Memorial Day.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-2.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients for the wraps\n\n*   4 large tortillas or gluten free tortillas\n*   grilled chicken or rotisserie chicken\n*   shredded lettuce or spinach\n*   sliced or diced avocado\n*   fresh basil (consider an herb garden on your front steps or side yard for fresh herbs year round)\n*   basil pesto\n*   cooked bacon\n*   crumbled blue cheese or shredded cheddar\n*   (If you want to add more to your wrap, red onion, cucumbers, and tomatoes would be delicious)\n\n### Here are the quick details\n\nThe recipe calls for already cooked chicken. You can use whatever you have on hand. Or make the black pepper chicken I often grill during the warm weather months.\n\nIt’s simply chicken tenders, tossed with olive oil, either cajun seasoning or fajita seasoning, and black pepper. Literally just three ingredients, but this mix is a go-to for me. I gave you the recipe in the notes section, so you can use that, or as I said, use leftover chicken.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-3.jpg)\n\nThe reason I really wanted to make these? I wanted another recipe to use [my homemade tortillas](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/homemade-flour-tortillas/) with. If you guys haven’t made these yet, please make them soon! They are far superior to anything you might find at the store.\n\nVery soft, but with deliciously charred pockets and so much flavor. They’re perfect for this style of wrap because you can really taste the tortillas.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-4.jpg)\n\n### The salad\n\nFor the salad, I made a short-cut Caesar dressing and tossed it with some shredded romaine lettuce, cubed avocado, and fresh basil.\n\nThe dressing is obviously key, it adds creaminess plus flavor to each wrap.\n\nWhen you have the salad tossed, all that’s left is to roll the wraps. As I mentioned, I used my homemade tortillas, then layered on some basil pesto, the Caesar salad, grilled chicken, bacon, and some blue cheese. If you don’t enjoy blue cheese, you can use shredded cheddar or even just crumbled feta.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-5.jpg)\n\nThen, wrap and roll burrito style.\n\nSince I used fresh grilled chicken and warm tortillas off the skillet, I didn’t feel the need to warm my wraps. But if you like, you can cook them in a skillet with a little olive oil until warmed. Or serve them chilled – either way is honestly so delicious.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-6.jpg)\n\nThese would be really nice for your Memorial Day picnics…and any other summer outings to follow.\n\nI know Creighton wishes he had his own wrap will sitting here by the pool!\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-7.jpg)\n\n_Looking for other picnic-style sandwich recipes?

Use a food processor to easily mix up your pesto! It was traditionally made by mixing the ingredients with a mortar and pestle.\n\n**Is pesto healthy?**\n\nYes! All of the ingredients in pesto have health benefits and the fat source is considered unsaturated.\n\n**Where did pesto originate?**\n\nThe bright green, herby sauce originated in Genoa, Italy.\n\n**How else can I use pesto?**\n\nAdd a dollop of pesto to pasta, spread on sandwich bread, or add to poultry and vegetables. It’s a versatile spread that is delicious when used a number of ways!\n\nPrep Time 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings: 4 wraps\n\nCalories Per Serving: 792 kcal\n\nNutritional information is only an estimate.

It is a super simple to make marinade, that offers great flavors in as little as 20 minutes. I loved how flavorful this chicken turned out.\n2.  Then you have the [cucumber salad](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/greek-cucumber-salad-2/ \"Greek Cucumber Salad\"). It is a pretty simple recipe that utilizes fresh cucumbers, lemon, and seasonings. I could eat a big bowl of this by itself.\n3.  Last, there is the [tzatziki](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/tzatziki/ \"Tzatziki\"), which I think just brings the whole dish to life with the fresh flavors, and smooth creaminess.\n\nThe chicken is tender and juicy, the veggies fresh, and the flavors are awesome. I was worried the cucumbers wouldn’t stay crisp, but if you use the English cucumbers, they should be good for the 3-5 days.\n\n![Greek Bowl: Insanely delicious Greek Chicken bowl recipes.

I love these because they are divided into 3 compartments, are washable (dishwasher safe) and reusable, and come in [black](https://amzn.to/2vGSDmo) or [green](https://amzn.to/2vGwkxj), so I can make one with more garlic for me and less garlic for the husband, and we can know which is which.\n*   For additional meal prep, check out this [cookbook featuring 100+ ideas](https://amzn.to/2iRhw6T) or try this recipe for [ITALIAN CHICKEN MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) or [TACO MEAL PREP BOWLS](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   I loved this [meal prep lunch bag](https://amzn.to/2jFBXaY) for keeping things cool and organized.\n*   Meal prep with multiple people and swap to avoid eating the same thing all week.\n*   This meal is best within 3 days, but is good up to 5 days.\n*    This does NOT have to be a meal prep, it also serves as a delicious family dinner option!\n*   Start your brown rice in a [rice cooker](https://amzn.to/2iIkrE0), or use something like these [Ready To Serve Rice Bowls](https://amzn.to/2jTaTTC) to speed up meal prep.\n\n### More Meal Prep Ideas\n\nOther Easy Meals you May Enjoy and could work for Meal Prep:\n\n*   [Flank Steak Sheet Pan Fajitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-flank-steak-fajitas/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Garlic Chicken](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/sheet-pan-garlic-chicken-veggies/)\n*   [Chicken and Veggie Pitas](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/10-minute-grilled-chicken-protein-pitas/)\n*   [Taco Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/salsa-verde-taco-meal-prep-bowls-easy/)\n*   [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/) \n\n![Greek chicken meal prep bowls are easy to make and deliciously healthy.](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/greek-chicken-meal-prep-3-1-320x320.jpg)\n\n#### Greek Chicken\n\n*   2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts\n*   1/4 cup olive oil\n*   3 Tbs garlic minced (Note, adjust to preference)\n*   1/3 cup fresh lemon juice\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1 Tbs dried oregano\n*   1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n#### Cucumber Salad\n\n*   2 English cucumbers peeled and sliced\n*   1/3 cup lemon juice\n*   2 Tbs olive oil\n*   1 Tbs red wine vinegar\n*   1/2 Tbs minced garlic\n*   1/2 tsp dried oregano\n\n#### Tzatziki Sauce\n\n*   1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   1 English cucumber finely diced\n*   1 tsp \\- up to 1 Tbs minced garlic adjust to garlic preference\n*   1/2 Tbs dill weed or 1 Tbs fresh dill, chopped fine\n*   1 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tsp lemon zest\n*   1/2 tsp chopped fresh mint optional\n*   Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### The Rest\n\n*   3 cups cooked brown rice\n*   1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes halved\n*   1/2 cup red onion slices\n\n*   In a large plastic zip bag, combine olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, greek yogurts and salt and pepper. Massage to mix.\n    \n*   Add chicken into the bag.\n    \n*   Massage to make sure chicken is full covered and marinate for at least 20 minutes, up to 12 hours.\n    \n*   Drain the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade.\n    \n*   In a skillet, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat.\n    \n*   I used my [Anolon Skillet](http://amzn.to/2vGtydc) which I love because it heats evenly, is metal utensil friendly, and can be used in the oven up to 400 degrees.\n    \n*   Add chicken when it is hot, and cook, flipping part way through. Cook approximately 3-4 minutes per side. Cooking time depends on thickness and size of the chicken. Cook until internal temp is 165 degrees.\n    \n*   Remove from pan, and let cool.\n    \n*   Once cool, cut into bite sized pieces. Just make sure you let it cool, or all the juice will run out.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, make cucumber salad by chunking the cucumbers, and tossing in a bowl with the lemon juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and oregano. Set aside\n    \n*   Make tzatziki sauce by combining the Greek yogurt, cucumber, garlic, dill weed, lemon juice, lemon zest in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. And add mint (optional)\n    \n*   Refrigerate while assembling your bowls.\n    \n*   Cook brown rice according to package directions. When finished cooking, divide between meal prep containers, 1/2 cup in each container, halve cherry tomatoes, and mix with red onion slices. Divide amongst the bowls.\n    \n*   Top with chicken, cucumber salad, and some tzatziki sauce.\n    \n*   Keep for 3- 5 days in airtight container, serve cold!\n    \n\n\\* Adjust garlic to your preference. I love garlic. Cut back if you don't (in marinade and tzatziki sauce)  \nThe marinade should be drained off, you don't want to eat all that garlic, just use it to flavor your chicken.  \n\\*\\* Another great meal prep option are these [Italian Chicken Meal Prep Bowls](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/italian-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nRecipe adapted from [Damn Delicious](http://damndelicious.net/2016/11/16/greek-chicken-meal-prep-bowls/)\n\nCalories: 521kcal | Carbohydrates: 40g | Protein: 43g | Fat: 21g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Cholesterol: 97mg | Sodium: 109mg | Potassium: 1246mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 8g | Vitamin A: 725IU | Vitamin C: 44.1mg | Calcium: 126mg | Iron: 3mg\n\nOur recipe card software calculates these nutrition facts based on averages for the above ingredients, different brands, and quality of produce/meats may have different nutritional information, always calculate your own based on the specific products you use in order to achieve accurate macros for this recipe.\n\n![](https://www.eazypeazymealz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thumbnail_App-Icon.png) Try PrePear, my FREE Meal Planning App that allows you to save your recipes, plan meals, shop for groceries, and cook simply in one place.

Or you could use pears or figs.\n*   **Dried cranberries or raisins** add sweetness.\n*   **Nuts and seeds**: pecans, walnuts, or roasted pumpkin seeds add crunch, flavor, and healthy fats.\n*   **Crumbled feta cheese, goat, or blue cheese**\n*   **Apple cider vinaigrette**: a simple yet flavorful dressing made of honey, Dijon mustard, garlic, apple cider vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil\n*   **Protein**: toss in some shredded chicken or chickpeas (optional)\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n*   One butternut squash _peeled, seeded and diced_\n*   ½ tablespoon oil of choice\n*   salt and freshly ground pepper\n*   1/2 cup quinoa or Rice \n*   2 cups chopped kale leaves\n*   Two small apples, pears, or figs sliced or dice\n\n**Toppings:**\n\n*   ¼ cup dried cranberries\n*   ¼ cup pecans roughly chopped\n*   ⅓ cup reduced-fat crumbled feta cheese\n*   2 tbsp nuts or seeds\n\n**For the apple cider vinaigrette:**\n\n*   3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n*   2 tbsp apple cider vinegarette\n*   1 tbsp maple syrup or honey\n*   1.5 tsp Dijon mustard\n*   One garlic clove minced\n\n**Directions**\n\n**Roast the butternut squash.** Toss with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n\n**Cook the quinoa** and let it cool.\n\n**Make dressing.** Put all the ingredients in a jar and shake until combined.\n\n**Massage the kale**.

    "markdown": "# Fall Quinoa Spinach Salad - Eating Bird Food\nThis post may include [affiliate links](#). Thank you for your support.\n\n> This quinoa spinach salad is loaded with fall favorites like butternut squash, chopped apples and quinoa. It is packed with nutrition and flavor and you’ll love the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing!\n\nI typically go crazy with pumpkin recipes as soon as fall hits, but today I have a pumpkin-less recipe that features more fall produce favorites – butternut squash, apples and greens. I’ve been eating these things separately or in other dishes, but finally decided to throw them all together for a tasty meal-sized salad.\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples. A fork of on the plate and a dish towel to the side.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fall-harvest-salad-updated.jpg)\n\nHearty fall salads are seriously the best! In this Quinoa Spinach Salad, the [roasted butternut squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/web-stories/how-to-make-roasted-butternut-squash/) makes it sweet and satisfying, while the apple and pepitas add a nice crunch. Quinoa adds some staying power and the spinach nourishes the body in a way that no other food (besides other leafy greens) can. If you like my [garlicky kale salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/garlicky-kale/), you’ll love this one because the dressing is almost exactly the same – I just added a little maple syrup to sweeten it up a bit. And if you enjoy this salad, you should also check out my full roundup of [quinoa salad recipes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/easy-quinoa-salad/).\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad.jpg)\n\nHealth Benefits of Quinoa\n-------------------------\n\nI love using quinoa as a base for salads. It’s naturally gluten-free, high in protein and one of few plant foods that contain all nine essential amino acids ([source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-quinoa)). Not only that, but it’s also high in fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin E and various beneficial antioxidants! Talk about a powerhouse ingredient!\n\nUnfamiliar with making quinoa? I’ve got a great guide on [how to cook quinoa](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/) and it’s loaded with information about this little seed too.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest spinach salad in a bowl before being fully mixed-- chopped apple, quinoa, cranberries, pecans, butternut squash, and spinach.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-2.jpg)\n\nHere’s What You Need\n--------------------\n\n*   **baby spinach** and **quinoa** – the base of this [meal-sized salad](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/how-to-build-a-healthy-salad/). You’ll need 1 1/2 cups of cooked quinoa which is 1/2 cup dry quinoa.\n*   **butternut squash** – cut the squash into uniform, bite-size pieces so they roast evenly.\n*   **apple** –  I prefer to use Honeycrisp, Pink Lady or Fuji apples, but any variety will work. Uniform, bite sized pieces are ideal here too so you can get a bite with all the flavors together!\n*   **pepitas** – pepitas are pumpkin seeds without the shell, but if you can’t find them you can use regular pumpkin seeds or even pecans for a nice added crunch. Roast them alongside the butternut squash for a roasted flavor boost.\n*   **dried cranberries** – I love adding dried fruit to my salads for a little touch of sweetness and texture. Raisins would also be great in this recipe.\n*   **tahini apple cider vinegar dressing** – tahini, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, tamari, nutritional yeast, garlic and a touch of maple syrup make up this delicious salad dressing.\n\n![Ingredients for the fall harvest salad in a glass bowl being tossed with the apple cider vinegar tahini dressing.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-3.jpg)\n\nSteps to Build This Salad\n-------------------------\n\n**Prep butternut squash** – Prepare the squash by peeling it, cutting it in half and scraping out the seeds, then cut the squash into bite-size cubes. You can also buy pre-cut butternut squash to skip this step! Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and roast at 400°F for 30-40 minutes, turning once or twice, until all the pieces are tender and have a few small brown spots.\n\n**Roast pepitas** – If your pepitas or pecans are raw, you can toast them in the oven with the roasting squash. Spread seeds/nuts on a separate baking sheet and add to the oven with the butternut squash for 5 to 10 minutes or until the seeds/nuts are golden and crunchy, then remove from the pan to cool. Be sure to watch the seeds/nuts carefully because they can burn quickly. The pepitas will take less time to toast than the pecans because they’re smaller.\n\n**Assemble salad** – While roasting the squash, toss together spinach, cooked quinoa, apple and cranberries in a large salad bowl. Add cooled pepitas (or pecans) once they’ve been toasted. Once the butternut squash is done roasting, allow it to cool and then place into the salad bowl with the other ingredients.\n\n**Make dressing** – While while butternut squash is roasting, prepare the dressing by placing all remaining ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n**Serve** – Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.\n\n![Tossed fall harvest spinach salad in a glass bowl with wooden spoons.](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fall-Harvest-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nSwitch it up!\n-------------\n\nYou can easily swap some of the ingredients in this salad and get an entirely different meal that will be equally delicious!\n\n*   **Baby spinach** – use another dark, leafy green like kale or collard greens. Arugula is a great salad base as well.\n*   **Butternut squash** – try [roasted sweet potatoes](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/coconut-oil-roasted-sweet-potatoes/) instead, or even [cinnamon maple roasted Kabocha Squash](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-roasted-kabocha-squash/).\n*   **Apple** – instead of apple, you could use pears or even [jicama](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/jicama-nutrition-benefits).\n*   **Pepitas** – as mentioned above, you can also use pumpkin seeds or pecans. The idea here is to add some crunch so any kind of nut or seed will do!\n*   **Dried cranberries** – raisins or dried cherries would also be tasty!\n\nHow to Serve Fall Quinoa Spinach Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nFor me, this is a meal-sized salad I would eat on its own. But it would also make a great side salad if you want to serve it to more people! Here are some great ideas to serve alongside this salad:\n\n*   [Apple Cider Vinegar Chicken](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/apple-cider-vinegar-chicken/)\n*   [Pumpkin Spice Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/pumpkin-spice-salmon/)\n*   [Eggplant Casserole with Ground Turkey](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/eggplant-casserole/)\n*   [Maple Glazed Salmon](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/maple-soy-broiled-salmon/)\n*   [Butternut Squash Soup](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/butternut-squash-soup/)\n*   [Healthy Turkey Chili](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/turkey-chili/)\n\n![Salad plate filled with spinach harvest salad including butternut squash, cranberries, quinoa, pecans, and apples.

With diced sweet potatoes, fluffy quinoa, fresh spinach, creamy avocado, and a delightful combination of dried cranberries and slivered almonds, this **Roasted Sweet Potato, Spinach and Quinoa Salad** offers a burst of flavors and textures.\n\n![bowl of roasted sweet potato, spinach & quinoa salad](https://happilyunprocessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/roasted-sweet-potato-spinach-quinoa-salad.jpg)\n\nWHY THIS SALAD WORKS:\n---------------------\n\nDrizzled with a zesty lemon vinaigrette, every bite is a harmonious blend of tanginess and earthiness. The roasted sweet potatoes, cooked quinoa, and vibrant greens create a satisfying base, while the addition of red onion and garlic-infused dressing takes it to the next level. It all gets tossed together and is served immediately for a vibrant and nourishing meal.\n\nHow to Make It:\n---------------\n\n1.  To start, we roast the sweet potatoes until they’re tender and perfectly caramelized.\n2.  Meanwhile, the quinoa cooks in a flavorful chicken or vegetable stock, absorbing all the deliciousness. Once ready, we combine the roasted sweet potatoes, fluffy quinoa, chopped spinach, dried cranberries, sliced red onion, creamy avocado, and crunchy slivered almonds in a large bowl.\n3.  Now, let’s talk about the star of the show – the Lemon Vinaigrette. This zesty dressing brings everything together, adding a tangy and refreshing element to the salad. It combines red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, dried oregano, fresh basil, roasted garlic, organic lemon juice, olive oil, sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Whisking it all together creates a flavorful and emulsified dressing that perfectly complements the salad’s ingredients.\n4.  Remember, this salad is best served immediately to retain its freshness and crunch. The lemon vinaigrette adds a delightful tang, but be mindful not to overdress the salad, as it can cause the greens to wilt.\n\nNourishing Bliss\n----------------\n\nOur Wholesome Sweet Potato Quinoa Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette is not only a feast for the taste buds but also a nutritional powerhouse. Sweet potatoes offer a dose of vitamins and fiber, quinoa provides protein and essential nutrients, and spinach adds a boost of iron and antioxidants.

We adore their famous [Chipotle carnitas](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/chipotle-carnitas/), [Chipotle barbacoa](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/chipotle-barbacoa/), [cilantro lime rice](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/cilantro-lime-rice/), [Chipotle guacamole](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/chipotle-guacamole-recipe/), and this smoky and savory chicken.\n\n![Chopped Chipotle chicken on a plate served with salsas.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-4.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make. A great way to get that restaurant flavor in the comfort of your own home!\")\n\nWhat is chipotle chicken made of?\n---------------------------------\n\nChipotle uses a marinade to flavor its chicken. The marinade is made from the following ingredients:\n\n*   Onion: While this recipe is often made with white onion, I like to use red onion because it has a milder, sweeter flavor.\n*   Ancho Chile: This is a mild type of dried chile that is typically used in Mexican cuisine. You can either buy whole dried chilies and soak them until they get soft, or else use ancho powder. I’m using ancho chile powder here because it’s easier to locate in most grocery stores.\n*   Garlic: Use freshly chopped garlic for the best flavor.\n*   Adobo Sauce: Chipotle chiles are sold in cans of adobo sauce. This ingredient can be found in the international foods aisle of most grocery stores. The sauce has an intensely smoky flavor, but is not overly spicy. If you prefer that your chicken have some spice to it, you can also mince 1-2 chipotle peppers and add them to the marinade.\n*   Oil: The Chipotle restaurant uses rice bran oil, which is a neutral flavored oil. I have found that it’s not easy to locate this oil at the store, so I use olive oil, or another neutral flavored oil.\n*   Herbs and Spices: This marinade also includes traditional Mexican seasonings such as cumin and oregano for added flavor.\n\n![Chicken thighs with bowls of spices, olive oil, onion and garlic.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-1.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make. A great way to get that restaurant flavor in the comfort of your own home!\")\n\nHow do you make chipotle chicken?\n---------------------------------\n\nStart by placing all of the marinade ingredients in a blender, then process until a mostly smooth liquid forms. Pour the marinade into a large bowl or a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs to the marinade, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Remove the chicken from the marinade, then cook it using your preferred method. Let the chicken rest, then cut it into slices or chunks and serve.\n\n![A bowl of chicken in a marinade.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-2.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make. A great way to get that restaurant flavor in the comfort of your own home!\")\n\nTips for the perfect dish\n-------------------------\n\n*   I really prefer to use chicken thighs because they are more flavorful than chicken breasts and also less likely to dry out. That being said, if you prefer white meat, chicken breasts will also work.\n*   You can let the chicken sit in the marinade for up to 12 hours. Any longer than that and the texture of the chicken may start to change.\n*   I typically grill my Chipotle chicken, either outside on a grill or indoors on a grill pan. When the weather is cool and I don’t feel like grilling, I bake the chicken in the oven.\n*   Leftover chicken will stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze any extra cooked chicken for up to 2 months.\n\n![Chicken thighs cooked on a grill pan.](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chipotle-chicken-3.jpg \"This Chipotle guacamole is a copycat recipe that contains just six ingredients and takes just minutes to make. A great way to get that restaurant flavor in the comfort of your own home!\")\n\nHow to serve chipotle chicken\n-----------------------------\n\nThe beauty of this recipe is that the chicken can be served in so many different ways.\n\n*   Burrito Bowl: Make my super popular [burrito bowls](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/burrito-bowls-chicken/), but use this chicken instead of the chicken marinade listed in the recipe.\n*   Tacos: Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, then place in warm tortillas with lettuce, salsa and cheese.\n*   Enchiladas: Dice or shred the cooked chicken, then roll it up in tortillas and top with sauce to make the best [green chile chicken enchiladas](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/green-chile-chicken-enchiladas/).\n*   Soup: Chop up any leftover chicken to make a [Mexican chicken soup](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/mexican-chicken-soup/), or a [chicken tortilla soup](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/slow-cooker-chicken-tortilla-soup/).\n*   Fajitas: Use this marinade to make chicken fajitas!

    "markdown": "# Butter Cauliflower - Dishing Out Health\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_This Butter Cauliflower Recipe is a vegetarian riff on the classic Indian dish, Butter Chicken. In this version, tender cauliflower florets are simmered in a spiced cream sauce and served over rice with yogurt. A cozy weeknight dinner the whole family will love._ ![Vegetarian Butter Cauliflower recipe served over basmati rice with yogurt and naan](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower3.jpg)\n\nThe Best Butter Cauliflower Recipe:\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt’s official, cauliflower has hit its peak. In this Butter Cauliflower recipe, the versatile veggie takes on bright, vibrant flavors, and creates the heartiest homemade version of a classic. Serve it over rice, quinoa, or your grain of choice for a gluten free, vegetarian bowl of BLISS.\n\nIn its purest form, Butter Chicken consists of chunks of chicken marinated in a yogurt-and-spice mixture. The chicken gets simmered in a luxuriously creamy sauce comprising tomatoes, aromatics, a wealth of spices, and butter. This dish differs from Tikka Masala in that its more creamy than spicy, however Butter Chicken can still pack a fiery punch.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite Indian dishes because it truly has the power to warm you from the inside out. It’s also incredibly versatile, and you’ll notice most versions has varying ratios of spice.\n\nButter Cauliflower is best served with a side of naan to sop up any remaining sauce. It also makes the BEST leftovers once the flavors really have a chance to develop and marry. In short, it’s the kind of dish I could eat on repeat and never tire of.![Cauliflower florets simmered in a spiced curry sauce with cream and cilantro](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower2.jpg)![A vegetarian version of Butter Chicken made with cauliflower](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower6.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Butter Chicken Vegetarian:\n--------------------------------------\n\nCauliflower is one of the best plant-based subs for chicken in this recipe. However, in order to achieve the meatiest texture, the cauliflower requires a couple extra steps.\n\n*   First, sear the cauliflower florets in a skillet until slightly softened.\n*   Next, toss them in a corn starch, lemon juice, and spice mixture. Since classic Butter Chicken is marinaded in yogurt and spices, this step mimics the same acid + spice infusion. The corn starch will also help create a crust on the cauli, helping it retain its texture after being simmered in the sauce.\n\nAs far as spices, the classic lineup includes garam masala, ginger, cumin, fenugreek, and chiles. Some versions may also call for coriander, cardamom, turmeric, and paprika.\n\nIn addition, Butter Chicken always calls for butter, tomatoes, and cream, which compose the base of the sauce. In this version, I try to keep the spices relatively streamlined (turmeric, cumin, paprika, ginger, etc.), however garam masala is a must!\n\nIncase you’re not familiar, garam masala is a super fragrant spice blend that includes many of the above mentioned ingredinets. The main difference between garam masala and curry powder is that it does not include turmeric. For this reason, garam masala tends to taste a bit sweeter, more floral, and less earthy.![Crispy cauliflower florets marinaded and pan-seared](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower.jpg)![A vegetarian version of Butter Chicken using cauliflower](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ButterCauliflower4.jpg)\n\nWhat to Serve with Butter Cauliflower:\n--------------------------------------\n\nI love serving this dish over basmati rice with a side of naan. However if you’re looking to add some protein, I recommend serving it over quinoa or tossing in some chickpeas.\n\nSwirling in a dollop of Greek yogurt at the end also ups the protein ante. Plus, it makes the sauce even creamier and balances the spice. This recipe is quite filling on its own between the fiber and satiating fats, though feel free to adjust and make it your own!\n\nTo finish off, add some fresh cilantro sprigs and a spritz of lemon juice!\n\nAnd, as always, if you give this recipe a try, be sure to tag #dishingouthealth so I can see your beautiful creations!\n\nOther Healthy Cauliflower Recipes to Try:\n-----------------------------------------\n\n#### [BBQ Cauliflower Tacos with Green Tahini Sauce](https://dishingouthealth.com/bbq-cauliflower-tacos-with-green-tahini-sauce/)\n\n#### [Cauliflower Burrito Bowls with Jalapeño Ranch](https://dishingouthealth.com/cauliflower-burrito-bowls-with-jalapeno-ranch/)\n\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice\n*   ▢ 2 tsp. corn starch\n*   ▢ 1/2 tsp. ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 tsp. ground turmeric divided\n*   ▢ 3 tsp. garam masala divided\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tsp. salt divided\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. olive oil divided\n*   ▢ 1 medium head of cauliflower cut into florets\n*   ▢ 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter\n*   ▢ 1 yellow onion finely chopped\n*   ▢ 3 garlic cloves minced\n*   ▢ 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger sub ground ginger\n*   ▢ 2 Tbsp. tomato paste\n*   ▢ 1 tsp. paprika\n*   ▢ 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon\n*   ▢ Pinch of cayenne pepper optional\n*   ▢ 1 8-oz. can tomato sauce\n*   ▢ 2 cups vegetable broth\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup heavy cream sub full-fat canned coconut milk\n*   ▢ Basmati rice for serving\n*   ▢ Fresh cilantro and whole-milk Greek yogurt for garnish\n\n*   Combine lemon juice, corn starch, cumin, and 1/2 tsp each of turmeric, garam masala, and salt in a large bowl.

Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again.\n\nWatch the Video\n---------------\n\n![Arugula Salad with Couscous Recipe Video](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Arugula-Salad-with-Couscous-Recipe-Video.jpg)\n\n**Related:** We love adding couscous to salads, here’s our [lemon and herb couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12689/lemon-and-herb-couscous-salad-recipe/) with tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\nOur Favorite Arugula Salad\n--------------------------\n\nIt’s funny how certain recipes sneak their way into your weekly rotation. This arugula and couscous salad has done just that. We make it for dinner, eat the leftovers for lunch, and have served it to friends more times than I can count.\n\nYou’ll be itching to make it again once you try this arugula salad recipe. The salad is **simple, fast, and tastes like it came from a fancy restaurant**. Here’s the rundown on how to make it:\n\n![Lemon Arugula and Couscous Salad with Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1-1200.jpg)\n\n**The base of our salad is couscous** — we particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous). It cooks quickly and **gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself**. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, barley, or other grains — farro is excellent in salads (see our [apple, arugula, and farro salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/43230/farro-salad-with-apples/) for inspiration).\n\nAdd crisp **cucumbers**, baby **arugula** (or other tender greens), and **feta** cheese to the couscous. The lemon vinaigrette is simple — just lemon juice, olive oil, and a little honey.\n\n**Tip:** Since the dressing is so simple, it’s easy to play with. If we have it on hand, we love throwing a tablespoon of minced preserved lemon to the party. You can buy it or make your own — we shared this [recipe for preserved lemon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/5543/olives-with-lemon-confit-and-chili-flakes/) a while back if you want to take a look.\n\n![Adding lemon vinaigrette to couscous for the arugula and couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arugula-Salad-Recipe-3-1200.jpg)\n\n**The real trick to this salad is assembling it:** toss most of the dressing with the warm couscous and let it cool slightly before adding other ingredients. We take the same approach when making potato salad (we toss warm potatoes with the dressing first). By doing this, the warm ingredient has a chance to absorb all the flavor in the dressing. A game changer.\n\nThe same idea applies if you swap the couscous for pasta or another grain. Toss the still-warm pasta/grain with the dressing first, let it absorb, and cool slightly. Then, move on to adding the rest of the ingredients.\n\n**This arugula salad would go really well next to** this [Seriously Good Turkey Burger](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/34790/seriously-good-turkey-burger/), our [Easy Lemon Garlic Baked Chicken Breasts](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28703/lemon-garlic-baked-chicken-breast-recipe/) and our [Perfectly Baked Salmon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/149/moms-oven-poached-salmon/) (inspired by my Mom).\n\n![Lemon Arugula Salad with Couscous, Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1200.jpg)\n\n**For more arugula recipes**, take a look at our [Fried Goat Cheese, Strawberry and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/648/fried-goat-cheese-arugula-salad/), our [Lemony White Bean and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/42176/white-bean-salad/), this lovely [Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad Recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12907/shaved-fennel-and-arugula-salad-recipe/) and these [Baked Chicken Thighs with Potatoes, Garlic and Arugula](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28824/baked-chicken-thighs-with-potatoes/).\n\nLemon Arugula Salad with Couscous and Feta\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   PREP 10mins\n*   COOK 10mins\n*   TOTAL 20mins\n\nOur arugula salad, made with an easy lemon vinaigrette, pearl couscous, cucumbers, and feta, is crave-worthy. Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again. We particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous) for this arugula salad. It cooks quickly and gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, or other cooked grains like barley or wheat berries.\n\nMakes 4 large servings\n\nWatch Us Make the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nYou Will Need\n-------------\n\nFor the Salad\n\n1 ½ cups dried pearl (Israeli) couscous, _about 3 cups cooked_\n\n3 ounces baby arugula or tender salad greens, _about 4 cups_\n\nHalf of a hothouse (seedless) cucumber, chopped\n\n2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled, _about 1/2 cup_\n\nFor the Dressing\n\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, _about 1/2 large lemon_\n\n4 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup\n\n1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon, _optional_\n\n1 teaspoon dried basil or a handful chopped fresh basil leaves, _optional_\n\nSea salt and fresh ground black pepper\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n1Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add couscous and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, then add to a large bowl.\n\n2Meanwhile, make the lemon vinaigrette. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, honey, preserved lemon, and basil until it looks thick and blended. Season to taste with salt and fresh ground black pepper (we add a generous pinch of each).\n\n3Toss the cooked and drained couscous with the dressing, then set aside for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly. Finish the salad by adding the arugula, cucumbers, and feta. Toss well, then serve.\n\nAdam and Joanne's Tips\n----------------------\n\n*   The salad will keep overnight in the fridge. As it sits, the greens may wilt slightly, but still will taste great.\n*   If you cannot find pearl (Israeli) couscous, substitute with a regular couscous, small pasta shape such as orzo or cooked grains like quinoa, wheat berries and barley.\n*   Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates. We have used the USDA database to calculate approximate values.

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://www.saltandlavender.com/privacy-policy/).\n\nThis **lemon orzo salad** recipe is a fresh, healthy, and colorful summer salad that’s a breeze to make! It’s ready in about 30 minutes.\n\nTry this [Easy Italian Pasta Salad](https://www.saltandlavender.com/easy-italian-pasta-salad-recipe/) for another quick summer salad recipe.\n\n![lemon orzo salad in a white bowl](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-1-720x1080.jpg)\n\nWhy you’ll love it\n------------------\n\nOrzo is extremely popular lately, so I’m thrilled to bring you even more recipes with it. You loved this [Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup](https://www.saltandlavender.com/lemon-chicken-orzo-soup/), so I’ve come up with this irresistible orzo salad with chicken and fresh vegetables and a **quick lemon honey vinaigrette** that’s simple to make.\n\nThis bright lemon orzo pasta salad is **easily customizable** and lends itself to substitutions or additions. My mantra has always been that summer recipes like salads should be fuss-free. Who wants to be in the kitchen for hours when you can be outside on the patio with a glass of prosecco?\n\nWhat you’ll need\n----------------\n\n_For the salad_\n\n*   **Orzo** – you’ll find this small rice-shaped pasta in the dry pasta aisle\n*   **Cucumbers** – I prefer using mini (Persian) cucumbers, but if you can’t find them, half a regular English one works just fine\n*   **Tomatoes** – use grape, cherry, or any little tomato variety\n*   **Onion** – red onion is the ideal kind for salads since it’s less sharp than other varieties and packs a crunch\n*   **Arugula** – for some green goodness, but it’s optional if you’d like this salad for meal prep\n*   **Chicken** – I just bought a rotisserie chicken for ease, but if you’ve got a leftover [Roast Chicken](https://www.saltandlavender.com/easy-roast-chicken/), that’s great too\n*   **Parmesan** – I can’t resist giving this pasta salad a little bit of a cheesy dimension\n*   **Basil** – fresh basil perfectly complements and enhances all the flavors\n\n_For the dressing_\n\n*   **Lemon** – we’re using both freshly squeezed lemon juice and the zest for ultimate brightness. I like to use my [Microplane](https://amzn.to/3OGHbPI) to effortlessly zest it.\n*   **Olive oil** – to balance out the acidity and add body\n*   **Honey** – for a hint of sweetness\n*   **Garlic** – use even more if you’re a big fan of garlic! I like to use [this garlic press](https://amzn.to/3I7oAJQ) to mince it since you don’t even need to peel the cloves.\n*   **Salt & pepper** – as with any pasta salad, it’s important to be generous\n\nMake ahead tip\n--------------\n\nIf you want to make this salad ahead of time or for meal prep, I suggest leaving out the arugula. That way, it’ll last in the fridge a few days no problem. Just mix in the arugula when you’re ready to enjoy it!\n\n![lemon orzo pasta salad with chicken in a glass prep bowl](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-3-720x1080.jpg)\n\nHow to make lemon orzo salad\n----------------------------\n\n_This is an overview, and full ingredients & instructions are in the recipe card below._\n\n*   Boil a salted pot of water, and cook the orzo al dente. Rinse with cool water, drain, and transfer the pasta to a large bowl.\n*   Prep and chop all the salad ingredients and add to the bowl.\n*   Add the dressing ingredients to a jar or small bowl and mix thoroughly. Toss the salad with the dressing, and enjoy!\n\nSubstitutions and variations\n----------------------------\n\n*   I used a rotisserie chicken for this recipe, but you can definitely quickly cook some chicken if you have some. Try pan frying it with your favorite seasoning, and it’ll be delicious.\n*   Need to make this vegetarian? Simply omit the chicken.\n*   Feel free to throw in any fresh herbs you may have in the garden!\n*   If you don’t like arugula, try swapping it for spinach.\n*   I think that Kalamata olives and/or capers would go great in here if you’re a fan.\n\nWhat to serve with orzo salad\n-----------------------------\n\n*   It makes a fantastic lighter main course, so it’s perfect on its own or with a slice of crusty bread.\n*   You can also leave out the chicken, and then it makes a perfect complement for seafood recipes such as my [Easy Pan Seared Salmon Recipe](https://www.saltandlavender.com/pan-seared-salmon/) or these [Tequila Lime Shrimp](https://www.saltandlavender.com/tequila-lime-shrimp/).\n\nLeftovers and storage\n---------------------\n\n*   As mentioned above, this orzo salad will keep in the fridge in an airtight container for 3-4 days no problem if you leave out the arugula.\n*   If this salad has been sitting out in the sun for any amount of time, I’d eat it right away or discard it for food safety reasons.\n\n![lemon orzo salad close-up](https://www.saltandlavender.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lemon-orzo-salad-recipe-2-720x1080.jpg)\n\nAre you an orzo fan? Leave me a comment below if you have any questions or if you’ve made this orzo salad. As always, tag me #saltandlavender on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/saltandlavender) if you’ve made one of my recipes. 🙂\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup uncooked orzo\n*   ▢ 2 mini cucumbers (or 1/2 English cucumber) chopped\n*   ▢ 1 cup little tomatoes (grape/cherry/etc.) cut into quarters\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons red onion chopped\n*   ▢ 2 cups (loosely packed) fresh arugula optional\n*   ▢ 2 cups cooked/rotisserie chicken\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons fresh basil sliced thin\n\n#### Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ 1.5 tablespoons lemon juice + zest of 1 lemon\n*   ▢ 2.5 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon honey\n*   ▢ 1 clove garlic minced\n*   ▢ Salt & pepper to taste\n\n*   Boil a salted pot of water and cook the orzo al dente according to package directions. Once it's done, rinse it with cool water and let it drain thoroughly. Transfer to a large bowl.\n    \n*   Meanwhile, prep all the salad ingredients and add them to the bowl. If you're not going to eat the salad right away, I suggest skipping the arugula.\n    \n*   Add the dressing ingredients to a jar or small bowl, and whisk/shake until well combined.\n    \n*   Toss the salad with the dressing. Add more lemon/oil if needed. I also add plenty of salt & pepper – there's a lot of pasta in here, so you need to salt it well so it doesn't taste bland.\n    \n\n*   This recipe makes quite a lot of pasta salad. If served with nothing else, this could serve 4 adults. You can easily get 6+ servings out of this. If you know you’re going to have leftovers, I suggest either leaving out the arugula or only tossing it with the portion of the salad you’ll be eating right away. Without arugula, this salad will last in the fridge for a few days no problem.\n*   _Nutritional information is provided as a courtesy only and should be construed as an estimate rather than a guarantee.

I love freshly sliced peaches, but have you ever tried grilling them? If not, you have to do it soon!\n\n**Grilling peaches intensifies their sweetness** by caramelizing the natural sugars and adding a little bit of smokiness. In this grilled peach salad, the combination of warm peaches with crisp mixed greens and fresh berries is beyond delicious!\n\nGrilled peach salad is perhaps my favorite summer salad, and it’s **really easy to make**! The only “cooking” part involved is grilling the peaches, which takes just 8 minutes or less. In total, it takes about 20 minutes to make, so it’s a quick recipe.\n\nEvery ingredient adds so much **texture, flavor, and balance**. I love adding blackberries, blueberries, feta cheese, candied pecans to it. It’s dressed with a super easy balsamic dressing, but you can always opt for a [creamy balsamic](https://cookingformysoul.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/) too.\n\nI usually serve this grilled peach salad on the side, but also love pairing it with my [Greek Chicken Kabobs](https://cookingformysoul.com/greek-chicken-kabobs/) or [Huli Huli Chicken](https://cookingformysoul.com/huli-huli-chicken/) to make it a full meal.\n\nI always get excited about incorporating all the wonderful summer produce and fruits!

It’s very easy and straightforward, and I also share tips and tricks on how to prevent them sticking to the grill.\n\n1.  **Preheat grill to medium-high heat:** Preheating is VERY important. If the grill grates are hot, the peaches will start developing grill marks immediately, which minimizes sticking. Oil the grates.\n2.  **Cut the peaches**, either into quarters or halves (remove the pit). **Brush** the flat side of the peaches, as well as the grill grates, with olive oil.\n3.  **Grill** cut-side down for 2 to 3 minutes UNDISTURBED per side. Removing them from the grill too early will cause them to stick.\n\n**How to Prevent Peaches from Sticking to Grill**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Find peaches that are ripe but also firm.** They need to be firm so they don’t get mushy, but also ripe for sweetness.\n*   **Size matters.** Bigger pieces of fruit work better. I’d recommend peach halves or quarters.\n*   Make sure the grill grates are **clean**.\n*   **Use medium-high heat.** This minimizes sticking to the grill. Brush the grill grates and peaches with **olive oil**.\n*   **Let them grill undisturbed** to get more defined grill marks. Check after 2-3 minutes and flip when ready.\n*   **Use a thin spatula:** It’s best to use a thin spatula to lift the peaches from underneath. Using tongs to flip peaches on the grill can sometimes rip the grill marks apart.\n*   **Outdoor grill, stovetop grill pan, or indoor electric grill:** I prefer cast iron, but if you’re worried about the fruit sticking to the grill, you can use a nonstick.\n\n![grilled peaches on mixed greens, berries, feta, and candied pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad2-min.jpg)\n\n**Ingredient Notes**\n--------------------\n\nGrilled peach salad is made with lots of great seasonal summer ingredients! Below I share a few ingredient notes from recipe testing. As always, the full ingredient quantity list can be found in the recipe card down below.\n\n**For the salad:**\n\n*   **Fresh peaches:** They should be ripe but firm. They need to be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but also relatively firm so that they don’t fall apart on the grill. The larger the peaches, the better.\n*   **Olive oil:** Brushing the peaches with olive oil helps prevent sticking.\n*   **Berries:** Use any fresh berries of your choice. Blackberries are my favorite for this recipe.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Choose a variety of mixed greens such as baby spinach, arugula, and romaine lettuce for texture.\n*   **Feta crumbles:** Adds fresh savory flavors. Other great choices are goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, and burrata cheese.\n\n**For the balsamic dressing:**\n\n*   **Balsamic vinegar:** For acidity and flavor.\n*   **Olive oil:** Use good extra virgin olive oil for better taste.\n*   **Minced garlic:** For flavor.\n*   **Honey:** To add sweetness and balance out the acidity.\n*   **Dijon mustard:** To help the vinegar and oil emulsify.\n*   **Salt and pepper** to taste\n\n![ingredients including water, salt, brown sugar, pecans](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-balsamic-dressing-labeled.jpg)\n\n**For the Candied pecans:**\n\n**Brown sugar:** For sweetness. I use light brown sugar.  \n**Water:** To help the brown sugar melt and to thin it out.  \n**Pecan halves:** You can also use walnuts, if you prefer.  \n**A pinch of salt:** helps balance out the sweetness.\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions**\n-----------------------------\n\nThis grilled peach salad takes about 20 minutes to make. Here’s a tutorial so you can see how easy it is!\n\n### **Step 1 | Make the candied pecans**\n\nIn a small skillet, melt the brown sugar with the water over medium-low heat. Add the pecan halves plus a pinch of salt. Stir to coat for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Want to spice them up? Add a little bit of ground cinnamon or cayenne pepper.\n\n![candied pecans in a small non-stick skillet](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/candied-pecans-for-salad-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 2 | Make the balsamic dressing**\n\nIn a mason jar, combine all the balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar and shake vigorously until emulsified or evenly combined.\n\n![prepared balsamic dressing in a mason jar](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/homemade-balsamic-peach-min.jpg)\n\n### **Step 3 | Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n[Cut the peaches](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/) into thick wedges or halves, making sure they are about the same size (remove the pit).\n\nGet your grill preheated to medium-high. Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Brush the peaches with olive oil to prevent them from sticking. Grill the peaches on each flat side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed, or until they develop grill marks. Using a thin spatula, flip and grill the other side for another 2-3 minutes.\n\n### **Step 4 | Assemble the peach salad**\n\nArrange a bed of mixed greens on a large platter. Top with the berries, the prepared candied pecans, crumbled feta, and grilled peaches. Drizzle the assembled grilled peach salad with the prepared balsamic dressing…and ENJOY!\n\n**Prep Ahead Tips**\n-------------------\n\nI wouldn’t recommend making the entire peach salad in advance, but you can certainly prep a few components ahead. If you do this, you can make the entire salad in less than 20 minutes!\n\n*   **Make the candied pecans the day before** and let them cool on the counter overnight. Keep them in a container or in a covered bowl.\n*   **Make the balsamic dressing** up to 2 days in advance and refrigerate. Before using, let it sit at room temp and shake it vigorously again before using.\n*   **Note:** I wouldn’t recommend cutting the peaches until ready to grill. They will release lots of juices, and turn soft and brown overnight.\n\n**Substitutions and Variations**\n--------------------------------\n\nHere are my favorite substitutions for my grilled peach salad:\n\n*   **Greens:** I use a simple blend of mixed greens. You can also use baby spinach, arugula, or your favorite lettuce. For some crunch, use romaine or little gem lettuce.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts work great too! Also try toasted pine nuts, pistachios, or almonds.\n*   **Peaches:** If you can’t find peaches, nectarines are a great substitute.\n*   **Berries:** Mix and match! Try blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Cheese**: Try goat cheese, gorgonzola, blue cheese, mozzarella, or burrata.\n*   **Dressing:** For a creamier texture, try my [Creamy Balsamic Dressing](https://cookingformysoul.com/creamy-balsamic-dressing/). Other great dressings are raspberry vinaigrette and basil vinaigrette.\n*   **Other favorite add-ins:** Avocado, fresh grilled corn, prosciutto, pickled red onions.\n\n![grilled peaches with berries, mixed greens, pecans, and feta](https://cookingformysoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/grilled-peach-salad4-min.jpg)\n\n**Pairings and Serving Ideas**\n------------------------------\n\nServe this grilled peach salad with [grilled chicken breast](https://cookingformysoul.com/easy-lemon-chicken-marinade/) to make it a whole meal! You can also [cook chicken breast on the stovetop](https://cookingformysoul.com/moist-juicy-seared-chicken-breasts/).\n\nGreat main dish recipes that would pair great with it:\n\n*   [Hawaiian Huli Huli Chicken](https://cookingformysoul.com/huli-huli-chicken/)\n*   [Spatchcock BBQ Chicken](https://cookingformysoul.com/spatchcock-bbq-chicken/) (Grilled or Roasted)\n*   [Marinated Beef Kabobs](https://cookingformysoul.com/marinated-steak-kabobs/)\n*   [Salmon Burgers with Garlic Herb Sauce](https://cookingformysoul.com/salmon-burgers/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken Kabobs](https://cookingformysoul.com/greek-chicken-kabobs/)\n\n**Other summer-inspired recipes you must try!**\n\n*   [\n    \n    Watermelon Feta Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/watermelon-feta-salad-blueberries/)\n*   [\n    \n    Tomato Basil Pasta\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/tomato-basil-pasta/)\n*   [\n    \n    Strawberry Chicken Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/strawberry-and-spinach-salad-with-herbed-chicken/)\n*   [\n    \n    Salmon Cobb Salad\n    \n    ](https://cookingformysoul.com/salmon-cobb-salad/)\n\n**Recipe FAQs**\n---------------\n\n**Should the peaches be ripe?**\n\nYes, they should be ripe for sweetness, but also relatively firm so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n\n**Can I use canned or frozen peaches?**\n\nPreferably not.\n\n**Can I use nectarines or apricots?**\n\nYou can use nectarines as a substitute for sure. Apricots may be a bit too small to grill properly, but you can.\n\n**Do you peel the peaches?**\n\nI personally prefer to keep the skin on, but you can peel them off if desired. I provide instructions in my [peach prep tutorial](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/).\n\n**How can I prevent the peaches from sticking to the grill?**\n\nMake sure the grill is HOT, brush the sliced peaches with oil, let them cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes before flipping, and use a thin spatula to lift and release the peaches from underneath the grill. Try not to use tongs.\n\n**Can I make this salad ahead?**\n\nGrilled peaches don’t store well, so I’d say no. However, you can make the balsamic dressing and the candied pecans in advance.\n\n**Tips for Success**\n--------------------\n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for sweetness but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **Don’t overcook** the peaches on the grill to prevent them from becoming mushy.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:** 1) Make sure the grill is HOT, 2) brush peaches with oil, and 3) let them grill undisturbed. 4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath.

Add the pecans plus a pinch of salt to the skillet. Stir to coat the pecans in melted sugar for about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool.\n    \n\n#### **Make the honey balsamic dressing**\n\n*   In a mason jar, combine all the honey balsamic dressing ingredients. Seal the mason jar with the lid and shake vigorously until evenly combined (emulsified). Set aside.\n    \n\n#### **Prep and grill the peaches**\n\n*   [**Cut the peaches**](https://cookingformysoul.com/how-to-cut-a-peach/)**:** Insert a sharp knife along the natural line coming from the stem of the peach until you hit the pit in the center, and cut in half in this direction by rotating it around the knife. Separate each half and remove the pit. Then, cut each half into 2 or 3 thick wedges.\n    \n*   **Grill the peaches:** Preheat grill to medium-high heat (it needs to be hot to minimize sticking) and oil the grates. Brush the sliced peaches on both sides with some olive oil. Grill each side for 2-3 minutes, undisturbed to allow grill marks to develop. Once ready, transfer to a plate. _**Tip:**_ _To flip the peaches, use a thin spatula and lift the peach from underneath to preserve the grill marks. Try not to use tongs._\n    \n\n#### **Assemble the salad**\n\n*   On a large platter, arrange a bed of mixed greens and top with the blackberries, blueberries, grilled peaches, candied pecans, and crumbled feta. Drizzle with the prepared honey balsamic vinegar to taste. Enjoy!\n    \n\n*   **Pick ripe but firm peaches:** They should be ripe for their natural sweetness to come out, but firm enough so they don’t fall apart on the grill.\n*   **How to prevent peaches from sticking to the grill:**  \n    1) Make sure the grill is preheated  \n    2) Brush the peaches and grill grates with olive oil  \n    3) Let them cook undisturbed until they get grill marks  \n    4) Use a thin spatula (rather than tongs) to lift and release the peaches from underneath. This will help maintain the grill marks on the peaches.\n*   **Prep ahead:** The dressing can be made up to 2 or 3 days in advance. The candied pecans can also be made up to 2 days ahead.  \n    Store leftovers in a container in the fridge for up to 3 days.\n\n**Substitutions:**\n\n*   **Peaches**: nectarines.\n*   **Berries:** Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.\n*   **Pecans:** Walnuts.\n*   **Mixed greens:** Romaine, arugula, or a mix of various greens.\n\n_Nutritional values per serving are estimates only._\n\nCalories: 356kcal | Carbohydrates: 30g | Protein: 6g | Fat: 26g | Saturated Fat: 4g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 5g | Monounsaturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 7mg | Sodium: 237mg | Potassium: 282mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 24g | Vitamin A: 636IU | Vitamin C: 14mg | Calcium: 34mg | Iron: 1mg"

This **Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini and Squash** is a super easy, super flavorful, one pan chicken and veggie recipe everyone in the family will love! It’s a hearty, bright and lemony dinner that makes great leftovers._\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with lemon wedges and sliced squash](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-2.jpg)\n\nChances are if you’re growing a garden or live by someone growing a garden, then right about now you have a bunch of zucchini and squash you need to use up. This healthy chicken recipe is the perfect use for it!\n\nMy brother, sister and mother-in-law all have gardens (I’m failing this year, someday I need to make time a grow a real deal garden. Last year I had one small box garden, I felt pretty cool) but they are are all generously sharing so much from their gardens (thank you!).\n\nMy brother was just telling me how quickly the zucchini and squash grow and he said he planted way too many, so lucky for me I get a bunch of them too. This skillet chicken recipe will be a new go-to use for all the summer squash and zucchini for me.\n\nThis lemon Parmesan chicken recipe is about as easy as it gets! Just some quick dicing for prep, then the chicken cooks in about 6 minutes and you set that aside and in the same skillet saute the zucchini and squash for about 4 minutes.\n\nThis is how you do simple weeknight dinners! Just be careful not to overcook the veggies as they will go from perfectly tender to mush in what seems like the blink of an eye.\n\nI just can’t get enough of these buttery-herb and lemony, garlic-Parmesan flavors! Make it soon, you’ll be glad you did!\n\nWatch the Video!\n----------------\n\n![Skillet Lemon Parmesan Chicken with Zucchini and Squash garnished with Parmesan and parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-9.jpg)\n\nLemon Parmesan Chicken Ingredients\n----------------------------------\n\nFor the chicken and zucchini skillet, you’ll need:\n\n*   Chicken breasts\n*   Olive oil\n*   Butter\n*   Salt and pepper\n*   Herbs and spices (Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder)\n*   Lemon zest and juice\n*   Zucchini\n*   Yellow squash\n*   Shredded Parmesan\n*   Fresh parsley\n\nHow to Cook Chicken in a Skillet\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Season diced chicken with herbs, spices and lemon zest, then cook in hot skillet with olive oil and butter.\n*   Transfer cooked chicken to plate and tent with foil to keep warm.\n*   Sauté zucchini and squash in that same skillet, seasoning with the same blend of herbs and spices.\n*   Return chicken to pan and drizzle in lemon juice. Sprinkle on Parmesan and garnish with fresh parsley, then toss to combine.\n*   Serve with your choice of rice, orzo, pasta, and more!\n\nCan I Use Chicken Thighs Instead of Breasts?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYes, you can use any cut of chicken you’d like here. I prefer using boneless, skinless chicken in this recipe, but feel free to use whatever you see fit.\n\nJust keep in mind that you may need to adjust the cook time slightly depending on how large you dice the chicken and what cut of meat you use.\n\nCan I Add More Veggies to This Chicken Skillet?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOf course! Lemon Parmesan chicken pairs well with almost any vegetable. I recommend using seasonal produce that cooks at roughly the same rate as the zucchini and squash (that way you’re not having to take ingredients in and out of the skillet to accommodate different cook times).\n\n![lemon parmesan chicken in skillet with sliced zucchini and squash garnished with parsley](https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/skillet-lemon-parmesan-chicken-zucchini-squash-6.jpg)\n\nTips for the Best Skillet Chicken and Veggies\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   Before cooking the chicken, dab it dry — preferably on both sides — and use a hot skillet. Try to give the pieces some space so you can get that nice golden brown sear for added flavor.\n*   Use shredded Parmesan cheese for the best texture and flavor, and not the cheese that comes in a shaker can.\n*   Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the brightest, freshest flavor.\n\nMore Healthy Chicken Recipes You’ll Love:\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*   [Grilled Greek Lemon Chicken](https://www.cookingclassy.com/grilled-cilantro-lime-chicken-with-avocado-salsa/)\n*   [Cilantro Lime Chicken with Avocado Salsa](https://www.cookingclassy.com/baked-sweet-potato-fries/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Hawaiian Chicken](https://www.cookingclassy.com/sheet-pan-hawaiian-chicken/)\n*   [Honey Lime Chicken Skewers](https://www.cookingclassy.com/honey-lime-chicken-skewers/)\n*   [Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps](https://www.cookingclassy.com/thai-chicken-lettuce-wraps/)\n*   [Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas](https://www.cookingclassy.com/sheet-pan-chicken-fajitas/)\n\n16 Quick & Easy 30 Minute Recipes!

Then with the motor still running, add olive oil in a slow stream until emulsified and creamy.\n    \n*   Drizzle olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat then add zucchini noodles, cooking for about 1 to 2 minutes until tender.\n    \n*   Add zucchini noodles to a large bowl and toss with avocado pesto.

My personal favorite is Yukon gold mashed potatoes because they are rich, flavorful, and super creamy when mashed. Russet potatoes will be lighter and fluffier. Or, get the best of both worlds and use half Yukon gold and half Russet potatoes. You can also use red potatoes, but the mashed potatoes will be heavier and less creamy and fluffy.\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n![recipe ingredients: chopped yukon gold potatoes, butter, milk and salt in bowls](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mashed-potatoes-ingredients-488.jpg?resize=1800%2C1200&ssl=1 \"Mashed potatoes ingredients. The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\n*   **Potatoes:** Yukon golds or Russets.\n*   **Butter:** You want the butter to be softened but not melted. Room temperature butter will melt into the potatoes easily.\n*   **Salt and Pepper:** You’ll add some salt to the cooking water and then more salt, to taste, after cooking. \n*   **Milk:** Whole milk makes the best rich and creamy mashed potatoes, but you can use skim milk if that’s what you have on hand. Warm the milk before stirring it into the potatoes. This keeps the potatoes from cooling off too much and helps to make creamy potatoes.\n\nHow to Make Mashed Potatoes\n---------------------------\n\n_Here’s an overview of the recipe steps. Find the full recipe with ingredient amounts and instructions in the recipe card below._\n\nScrub the potatoes. Whether or not to peel the potatoes is up to you. I usually peel Russet potatoes but not Yukon golds. Yukon gold potatoes have thin skins and the skins add nice texture.\n\nCut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Try to make the pieces about the same size so that they will cook evenly. Put the potatoes in a pot of cold water and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat.\n\nHow Long to Boil Potatoes for Mashed Potatoes\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBoil potatoes for 12-15 minutes, until they are very tender when pierced with a fork. To avoid lumpy potatoes, be sure to cook them until very tender. However, you don’t want to cook the potatoes so much that they are falling apart.\n\nPour the potatoes into a colander and drain them well. Then put the potatoes back into the hot pot for 2-3 minutes to allow extra moisture to evaporate.  This step gives you fluffier, creamier mashed potatoes.\n\n![side by side photos: potatoes and butter in pot and mashed potatoes, milk, salt and pepper in pot](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes.jpg?resize=1205%2C900&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\nAdd the butter and use a potato masher to mash the potatoes. The butter will melt into the potatoes as you mash them. Stir in the warm milk. Potatoes can vary in how thirsty they are, so add milk until the mashed potatoes reach your desired creaminess. Season to taste with salt and pepper, serve and enjoy!\n\nRecipe Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Start the potatoes in cold water and then bring it to a boil. Using a cold start promotes even cooking, so the outsides of the potatoes won’t overcook by the time the insides are done. Even cooking is also why you want to cut potatoes before boiling, instead of boiling them whole. \n*   Adding salt to the cooking water flavors the potatoes from the beginning. It really does make a difference!\n*   To avoid lumps, cook the potatoes until they are very soft and tender when pierced with a fork or knife. Lumpy mashed potatoes are usually caused by mashing undercooked potatoes.\n*   I recommend mashing your potatoes by hand for fluffy mashed potatoes. Using an electric mixer is easy, but it can result in a gummy or gluey texture because it makes it too easy to overwork the potatoes. The same goes for when you are mashing and stirring by hand – be careful to not overwork the potatoes.\n*   Be sure to use softened butter and warm milk (or cream).\n\n![serving dish with mashed potatoes topped with melted butter and chives](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mashed-potatoes-recipe-474.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe! Perfectly creamy, buttery and fluffy homemade mashed potatoes are a favorite side dish. With tips on how to make mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, bacon and more!\")\n\nHow to Reheat Mashed Potatoes\n-----------------------------\n\n*   Potatoes tend to dry out over time, so **add more milk** to make them creamy again.\n*   **In the microwave:** Microwave on high power, stirring occasionally, until hot. Add more milk as needed.\n*   **In the oven:** Stir a bit of milk into the potatoes and put them in a baking dish. Cover with foil and bake at 350° F until hot, stirring once or twice.\n*   **Make ahead:** You can make this recipe up to two hours ahead and then keep the potatoes warm in a slow cooker using the warm setting.\n\nRecipe Variations\n-----------------\n\n*   **Extra Rich and Creamy:** Instead of milk, use half and half or heavy cream for richer mashed potatoes.\n*   **Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes:** Substitute buttermilk for the milk. Do not warm the buttermilk or it may curdle. You’ll love the tangy buttermilk flavor!\n*   **Cream Cheese:** Add 4 ounces of cream cheese per 3 pounds of potatoes. Soften the cream cheese to room temperature and then mash it into the potatoes along with the butter.\n*   **Sour Cream:** Add 2 tablespoons of sour cream, plus more to taste if desired. Sour cream makes the potatoes extra creamy and adds a slightly tangy flavor.\n*   **Garlic Mashed Potatoes:** For easy garlic mashed potatoes, stir in garlic powder, starting with 1/4 teaspoon and then adding more to taste or try my [garlic mashed potatoes](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/garlic-mashed-potatoes/) recipe with [roasted garlic](https://kristineskitchenblog.com/roasted-garlic/). \n*   **Herb Mashed Potatoes:** Chives are a classic addition to mashed potatoes. Or, add other fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme or sage. If you want to add dried herbs, oregano, thyme and basil are good options.\n*   **Bacon:** Because everything is better with bacon! Cook chopped bacon in a skillet and then top mashed potatoes with the cooked bacon crumbles.\n*   **Loaded Mashed Potatoes:** The ultimate comfort food! Stir in sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, bacon crumbles and chopped chives or green onions. \n\n![mashed potatoes with butter and chives in a serving bowl](https://i0.wp.com/kristineskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-mashed-potatoes-467.jpg?resize=1800%2C1200&ssl=1 \"The BEST Mashed Potatoes Recipe!

These meatballs are tender to the core! Nestled in a rich and creamy lemon sauce, they are perfect to serve over pasta, quinoa, or fluffy rice!\n\n![greek chicken meatballs in lemon cream sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-12-710x1065.jpg)\n\nWarm, hearty and deliciously creamy!\n\nThese tender, seared chicken meatballs are rolling around in a creamy lemon sauce that has a nice little zing! They’re warm and comforting but still offer a bright and beautiful lemony flavor that doesn’t leave you feeling heavy. Don’t be surprised if you catch the fam eating right out of the skillet while the sauce is still warm and tangy.\n\nIt’s the perfect transitional meal to take us from summer right into fall or from winter into spring. I’m not quite ready to let go of all the summer flavors, but with the gloomy weather we’ve been having lately, I’m ready for warm bowls of food again. Greek chicken meatballs totally fit the bill.\n\n![chicken meatballs in lemon sauce with cooked orzo in speckled bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**What do you need to make the Greek chicken meatballs?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Garlic + herbs:** minced garlic, chopped parsley, and dried oregano help add flavor the meatballs. You can use fresh or dried herbs for this recipe. Keep in mind you need roughly double the amount if you’re using fresh herbs.\n*   **Lemon zest:** brightens up the meatballs and adds just a fresh flavor to them\n*   **breadcrumbs:** are used for binding. I prefer to use [Panko](https://amzn.to/31UtFlz) breadcrumbs because they melt right into the meatballs and you don’t even realize they’re there.\n*   **Feta cheese:** adds tang and aids in binding the meatballs as well. Before this recipe, I had never added feta cheese to homemade meatballs, and I love the flavor they add.\n*   **An egg:** Acts as a binder to hold everything together.\n*   **Ground chicken:** I prefer to use ground chicken breasts, but I would think if you like chicken thighs, you might want to use ground thighs here. They would certainly add more flavor and retain extra moisture as well!\n\n![ingredients for the meatball ball mixture in stainless steel bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-17-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### **How to portion chicken meatballs:**\n\nOnce you’ve made the meatball mixture, divide it into 24-28 portions. I like to use a [cookie scoop](https://amzn.to/3jSfROH) so that the meatballs are all the same size. Doing this also cuts down on the guesswork for cooking the meatballs because they cook up in roughly the same amount of time when they’re the same size.\n\n### **What if the meatball mixture sticks to my hands?**\n\nIf the meatball mixture sticks to your hands when you’re rolling them, just spray the inside of your hands with a little cooking spray before grabbing the meat mixture. This should keep the mixture from sticking to your hands!\n\n![close up of cooked chicken meatball in lemon cream sauce on a spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-4-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**How to make Greek chicken meatballs:**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  In a bowl, combine everything but the meat mixture along with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. I use a fork to mix all the ingredients together.\n2.  When the ingredients are mix, add the ground chicken and mix until just combined. You don’t want to overwork the meat mixture or you’ll be left with tough and dry meatballs. Portion the meatballs using a cookie scoop into roughly 1 ½ tablespoon portions. \n3.  Add a drizzle of oil to a hot skillet and cook the meatballs for about 5-7 minutes or until they cook all the way through. You want to flip them so that they brown evenly on all sides. Be sure to not overcrowd the pan or they won’t brown!\n\n> **TIP:** At this point, you can allow the meatballs to cool and freeze them for later. If you plan on making this midweek and don’t have the time to fry the meatballs the day of, just freeze the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment. When frozen, transfer to a freezer-safe bag.\n\n![close up of prepared meatballs in lemon sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients for the lemon sauce for Greek chicken meatballs?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Butter:** Butter plays a two-part role in the sauce. We’ll use a little bit to sauté the garlic and flour in and the last tablespoon is added at the end to add creaminess and a little bit of luster to the sauce.\n*   **Garlic:** sautéed in butter it adds so much delicious flavor to the sauce\n*   **flour:** just a tablespoon is used in this recipe to help thicken the sauce\n*   **Chicken stock:** is the base of the creamy lemon sauce\n*   **Green olives:** briny green olives are the perfect pairing to the bright zingy lemon sauce. Capers would also work if you aren’t a fan of green olives\n*   **Egg yolks:** the egg yolks I know are an unusual addition to a cream sauce. They help emulsify the sauce and make it extra creamy and delicious! Trust me, I was super scared to try it too, but I have a foolproof method for you below!\n*   **Lemon juice + zest:** help flavor the sauce\n*   **Nutmeg:** Add a depth of flavor that works beautifully with all the lemony flavor in this recipe. [Freshly grated](https://amzn.to/2Ds0dtI) works best!\n\n![lemon sauce pouring from spoon oven meatballs in bowl with orzo](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-5-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**The secret to perfectly smooth lemon sauce:**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cook the flour:** Add a knob of butter to the skillet and allow the butter to melt. Saute the garlic in the butter until fragrant. Then, add the flour and whisk. You want to let the flour cook for 30 seconds to get rid of the raw flavor. Then, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Once the stock is completely incorporated, allow it to reach a simmer and then let cook for a few minutes until it thickens just a tad bit.\n2.  **Combine the yolks and lemon juice:** While the sauce is thickening, you want to add the lemon juice to a bowl along with the egg yolks and whisk them to combine. Then, once the sauce is thickened, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet to the lemon egg mixture as you whisk. **Adding the hot liquid to the eggs and lemon juice will help temper the yolks so that the sauce doesn’t break later.** You’ll repeat the same thing a total of three times or until you’ve added a total of 3 tablespoons of the liquid to the yolk mixture.\n3.  **Finish the sauce:** With the skillet on the lowest heat setting, stir the yolk mixture into the skillet. Once combined, kick the heat up to medium and continue to stir and cook the sauce for 4-6 minutes until it thickens to your liking. Keep in mind it will thicken quite a bit when it cools, so you don’t want to thicken it too much at this point if you plan on serving it later! Stir in the lemon zest and the nutmeg. Then, add the butter and green olives to the sauce and stir to combine. Place the meatballs back into the pan and allow them to just heat through. Serve warm over buttered orzo, or with fried bread on the side.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Greek Avgolemono Soup](https://littlespicejar.com/avgolemono-soup/)\n*   [Rustic Chicken Piccata Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/rustic-chicken-piccata-meatballs/)\n*   [French Onion Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/comforting-french-onion-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Cajun Chicken Meatballs in Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/cajun-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Swedish Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/swedish-meatballs/)\n*   [Firecracker Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/firecracker-chicken-meatballs/)\n\n![skillet with meatballs and sauce with wooden spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-7-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![Greek Chicken Meatballs in Lemon Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-735x1102.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Meatballs:\n\n*   5 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon zest AND chopped parsley\n*   ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs\n*   ⅓ cup grated yellow onions\n*   ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   1 large egg\n*   1 ½ teaspoon dried oregano (a little more if it’s fresh)\n*   1 ¼ pound lean ground chicken\n\n#### Lemon Olive Sauce:\n\n*   3 tablespoons salted cold butter, cubed\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n*   1 ½ cups low sodium chicken stock\n*   ½ cup green olives (or use ¼ cup capers!)\n*   2 teaspoons lemon zest + ⅓ cup lemon juice\n*   2 egg yolks\n*   ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **MEATBALLS:** In a medium bowl, using a fork, mix together all the ingredients except the ground chicken. You also want to add 1 teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper. When the ingredients are combined, add the ground chicken and mix until \\*just\\* combined. Just be sure you don’t overwork the meat. Roll into 24-28 meatballs using a cookie scoop or about 1 ½ tablespoon each.\n2.  **COOK:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle in a little oil. Add the meatballs to the skillet but do not overcrowd. Cook in batches if they don’t all fit. Sear the meatballs for 5-7 minutes, flipping to brown all sides evenly, until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. Remove the meatballs to a plate.\n3.  **SAUCE:** Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet along with the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn. Add the flour and whisk. Once the flour cooks for 30 seconds, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Then, allow the sauce to reach a simmer, and continue to cook for 3 minutes or until the sauce thickens a bit. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and let the sauce hang out. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and egg yolks. Once combined, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet into the egg mixture while you whisk it. Repeat this step two more times (so a total of 3 tablespoon of sauce should be added to the yolks.) Then, with the heat on the lowest setting, add the yolk mixture to the sauce you have on the stove. Kick the heat up to medium and stir the sauce and allow it to cook for 4-6 minutes or until it thickens to your liking. Then, stir in the nutmeg and lemon zest. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper as desired. Add the last tablespoon of butter to the sauce and allow it to melt in slowly. Add the green olives to the sauce along with the meatballs. Let them heat through for just a minute or two until warm. Serve with fried bread, over buttered orzo, or rice!\n\nThis site contains affiliate links, if you make a purchase through them, we receive a small commission.\n\n_originally published on_ Sep 3, 2020 _(last updated_ Jul 9, 2022_)_\n\n[54 comments](https://littlespicejar.com/greek-chicken-meatballs-in-lemon-cream-sauce/#comments) [Leave a comment »](#respond)"

Please read my [disclosure policy](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_This roasted sweet potato and arugula salad recipe features some of my favorite fall flavors and always tastes so delicious this time of year._\n\n![Favorite Fall Salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-8.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette. It's the perfect vegetarian salad for fall and always so delicious! | gimmesomeoven.com\")\n\nThings are finally _(fi-na-lly!)_ cooling off here in Barcelona this week after the summer’s unrelenting heat wave, which of course instantly has me craving all of my nostalgic fall faves…including this yummy roasted sweet potato and arugula salad. ♡\n\nIt’s a simple one that you could easily make anytime of year. But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like. And if you feel like adding in an extra protein, some grilled chicken or bacon would be delicious mixed in too.\n\nLet’s make some salad together!  \n\n![Favorite Fall Salad Ingredients](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Feel-Good-Fall-Salad-1.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

We’ll then dice them into 1/2-inch cubes, toss with olive oil, season generously with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n*   **Greens:** I’m partial to the peppery flavor of fresh arugula in this salad, but you could also use baby kale (or other varieties of kale), baby spinach, or any other salad greens that you prefer.\n*   **Avocado:** Feel free to dice or thinly slice the avocado, which adds a lovely creaminess to the salad.\n*   **Crumbled cheese:** I love the tart and tangy flavor of goat cheese in this salad, but feta, blue, cheddar, or Manchego cheese would be delicious alternatives too.\n*   **Nuts:** Just about any of your favorite nuts or seeds will work well in this salad — pecans, walnuts, almonds, pepitas, you choose!\n*   **Dried berries:** Dried cranberries always feel so quintessentially fall-ish to me, but dried cherries, raisins or even apricots would work well too.\n*   **Dressing:** My [everyday salad dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/salad-dressing/) goes beautifully with this salad, made with a quick blend of olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, garlic, salt and pepper.\n\n![Step by step instructions for how to make favorite fall salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fall-Salad-Collage.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

Is it just me, or is pumpkin everywhere this year?! Pumpkin Spice Cookies, Pumpkin Spice Cereal, Pumpkin Spice Peanut Butter, and of course, the iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte. It’s a bit overwhelming – I even have a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/Platingspairing/pumpkin/) dedicated solely to Pumpkin.\n\nIn an effort to keep up with the Pumpkin-wielding Jonses, I’m throwing this Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese & Dried Cranberries into the mix.\n\nWhile some people may have a _pumpkin_ obsession, my obsession generally lies with [risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/category/recipes/risotto/). Like my [Lemon Mascarpone Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/lemon-mascarpone-risotto/), [Beet Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/beet-risotto-goat-cheese/) and [Grilled Shrimp Risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/grilled-shrimp-risotto/).\n\nNot only do I like eating risotto, but I thoroughly enjoy the process of making it – Mainly because I get to stand over a hot stove when it’s freezing cold outside. Freezing cold = 60 degrees and below in my book.\n\nThe process of making risotto is easy, but it does take some babysitting because you need to “feed” the risotto. We’re _feeding_ the risotto with a ladle full of stock time after time, letting it fully absorb between each addition.\n\nThe process takes about 20 minutes from start to finish, and it’s a full evolution. The risotto starts as hard grains of rice, then it becomes more plump, and then, through all the stirring and the feeding, it takes on the most incredible creamy texture that’s tasty on it’s own, but also totally customizable with any ingredients of your choosing.\n\n[![Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese and Dried Cranberries in bowl with a Barolo wine pairing.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pumpkin-risotto-6-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/pumpkin-risotto-6-2/)\n\nThis is the most amazing fall risotto. The [pumpkin](http://amzn.to/2kDojCT) and [dried cranberries](http://amzn.to/2kDhsJS) just call out Thanksgiving to me. Plus, I’m making this risotto totally meat free, meaning that it would be a perfect option to serve for a vegetarian Thanksgiving.\n\nThe creamy pumpkin lends a rich, earthy flavor to the mix, the goat cheese adds tang and creaminess, and the dried cranberries give zing and add their beautiful color to the dish.\n\nHow to make ahead & reheat\n--------------------------\n\n*   **To store:** Keep any leftover risotto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n*   **To reheat:** Place the leftovers into a pan with a bit of extra broth and heat over medium heat until warmed through.\n\nHere’s a full post with my tips on [how to reheat risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/how-to-reheat-risotto/).\n\n[![Pumpkin Risotto with Goat Cheese and Dried Cranberries in bowl - Close up shot.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pumpkin-risotto-4-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/pumpkin-risotto-4-2/)\n\n🍽 Serving suggestions\n----------------------\n\n*   [Easy Arugula Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/perfect-green-arugula-salad/)\n*   [Sauteed Spinach](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/easy-sauteed-spinach-recipe/)\n*   [Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/brussels-sprouts-salad/)\n*   [Vegan Caesar Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/vegan-caesar-salad/)\n*   [Shaved Fennel Salad](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/fennel-celery-salad/)\n*   **MORE —> 35+ EASY [sides for risotto](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/what-to-serve-with-risotto/)!**\n\nWhat’s your favorite pumpkin dish or product of the season?

Add another ladle of stock, and continue cooking until evaporated again. Continue cooking, adding a ladle of stock at a time, and allowing to evaporate in between each addition. Cook until the rice is done, but has a bite to it, it should be creamy in texture, and will take about 20-25 minutes.\n    \n*   Mix in the parmesan, half of the parsley, and nutmeg. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with the remaining parsley, goat cheese and dried cranberries.

Mine vary from [smoked mackerel and pea risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/smoked-mackerel-risotto/) and [tomato risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/tomato-risotto/) all the way through to a delicious [black pudding risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/black-pudding-risotto-with-bacon-and-peas/) and [chicken and chorizo risotto](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/chicken-and-chorizo-risotto/).\n\nI find the whole process of adding stock and stirring whilst sipping wine and listening to music very cathartic and incredibly relaxing.\n\nThis butternut squash risotto recipe uses some of the finest autumnal ingredients that just work well together to create comfort food heaven.\n\nThe roasted butternut squash puree is joined by sage, which is a wonderful flavour combination.\n\nI round it all out with some crumbled blue cheese, I use Roquefort, and that’s it, job done!\n\nThis cooking malarkey is simple!\n\nIt is nothing more than a series of simple techniques which can all be learned.\n\n[![Close-up butternut squash and sage risotto served with Roquefort cheese.](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-02.jpg)](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-02.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**What risotto rice should I use?**\n\nI base all of my risotto recipes on Arborio rice because it is the most commonly available.\n\nThis recipe is equally good, if not better made with carnaroli rice, rice that has a higher starch content which leads to an even creamier mouthfeel.\n\n**Can I use a different type of squash?**\n\nYes, absolutely. My cooking is very much focused on cooking for two, and as a result butternut squash is the logical choice.\n\nYou can often buy small ones that leave no waste, but you can use whatever you like.\n\n**What can I do with leftover** **butternut squash?**\n\nIf you can only get your hands on a larger squash, don’t worry, here are a few options that will help you use the leftovers\n\n*   [Burmese Pumpkin Curry](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/pumpkin-curry-with-tamarind/).\n*   [Roasted Butternut Squash Pasta](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/butternut-squash-pasta/).\n*   [Butternut Squash Chilli](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/pumpkin-chili/).\n*   [Butternut Squash Tagine](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/butternut-squash-tagine-with-almonds-and-apricots/).\n\n**How do I store leftover squash?**\n\nTry and keep it in a large “lump”, so cut it in half and roast half for this recipe. Then tightly wrap the other half in cling film and keep it in the fridge. You should get 3 or 4 days out of it.\n\n**Can I use a different blue cheese?**\n\nYes, you could use everything from gorgonzola to Danish blue and all the way through to the mighty Stilton, choose something that you like!\n\n**Can I use dried sage?**\n\nYes, depending on how fresh your dried sage is use between half and one tablespoon.\n\n[![Roasted butternut squash and sage risotto served with Roquefort cheese.](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-04.jpg)](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-04.jpg)\n\nServing Suggestions\n-------------------\n\nRisotto is a wonderful one-bowl meal of loveliness that needs little else, and this roasted butternut squash number is no different!\n\nHowever, I almost always serve a risotto with some form of bread, I prefer either some toasted ciabatta or fresh focaccia.\n\nMy wife prefers [garlic bread](https://www.thedinnerbite.com/baguette-garlic-bread/) or [cheesy garlic bread](https://biteontheside.com/homemade-easy-cheesy-garlic-bread/) so I’ll leave it for you to guess who usually wins.\n\nHowever, we both agree that the rest of the left over wine must be consumed with the risotto!\n\n[![Overhead close-up butternut squash and sage risotto served with Roquefort cheese.](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-05.jpg)](https://www.krumpli.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-with-Sage-05.jpg)\n\nEquipment Used\n--------------\n\nI only name-check brands of equipment if I think that they make a material difference to a recipe. But if you have any questions feel free to ask them in the comments section below the recipe.\n\n*   Stovetop.\n*   Oven.\n*   Roasting dish.\n*   28cm or 11″ frying pan or skillet.\n*   Small saucepan to keep the stock warm.\n*   Ladle, stirring and serving spoons.\n*   Spoon and fork for scooping out and mashing the butternut squash.\n*   Kitchen knife.\n*   Chopping board.\n*   Weighing scales and or measuring jug, cups and spoons.\n\n_Prep Time:_ 10 minutes\n\n_Cook Time:_ 1 hour 15 minutes\n\n_Total Time:_ 1 hour 25 minutes\n\nRoasted butternut squash puree is at the heart of this delicious and comforting risotto recipe which is paired with the classic flavours of sage and blue cheese.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 Small (500g) Butternut Squash\n*   1-2 Tbsp Olive Oil\n*   ½ Tsp Coarse Sea Salt\n*   ½ Tsp Black Pepper\n*   175g (¾ Cup) Risotto Rice\n*   30g (2 Tbsp) Butter\n*   35g (1 Small) Banana Shallot\n*   50g (1 Stick) Celery\n*   2 Garlic Cloves\n*   175ml (¾ Cup) White Wine\n*   500ml-650ml (2½ Cups) Vegetable Stock\n*   16-24 Sage Leaves\n*   100g (1 Cup) Roquefort Cheese\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds, place it in a roasting dish, drizzle over the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 55-60 minutes at 180°C or 350°F and set aside to cool a little.\n2.  Cut the shallot in half, peel it and then dice it as finely as you can.\n3.  Dice the celery as finely as you can.\n4.  Peel the garlic and dice it as finely as you can.\n5.  Cut the sage leaves into thin strips.\n6.  Heat the vegetable stock to a slow simmer.\n7.  Heat a 28cm or 11\" frying pan or skillet over a medium-high heat and add the butter.\n8.  When the butter begins to foam add the diced shallot and and celery and cook until softened, this will take around 4-5 minutes. If they begin to colour reduce the heat a little.\n9.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.\n10.  Pour in the risotto rice and stir until the grains become translucent at the edges, this should take 2-3 minutes.\n11.  Add the shredded sage, pour over the white wine and stir until almost all of the wine has evaporated/been incorporated into the rice.\n12.  Turn the heat down a little and slowly stir in the hot vegetable stock a ladle full at a time. Stirring continually, making sure almost all of the stock has been incorporated each time and the pan is almost dry. As you get to the end of the cooking process you can add more stock at a time.\n13.  Repeat this until all of the stock is incorporated and the rice is cooked with a very slight bite which should take between 25 and 35 mins.\n14.  Scoop the roasted squash from the skins which should be cool enough to handle now, and mash with a fork to form a puree. It should yield around 300g or 1 cup of roasted butternut squash puree.\n15.  Stir the squash puree into the risotto and cook until it is all incorporated and creamy, then remove from the heat and add a lid, letting the dish sit for 5 minutes.\n16.  Whilst the risotto is relaxing crumble the Roquefort cheese, then serve the risotto topped with the crumbled cheese.\n\n#### Nutrition Information:\n\n#### Yield:\n\n2\n\n#### Serving Size:\n\n1  \n_Amount Per Serving:_ Calories: 486Total Fat: 29gSaturated Fat: 18gTrans Fat: 1gUnsaturated Fat: 9gCholesterol: 76mgSodium: 1489mgCarbohydrates: 37gFiber: 3gSugar: 6gProtein: 10g\n\n_Calorific details are provided by a third-party application and are to be used as indicative figures only._"

This girl!\n\nOf course it took posting a photo of this plate-o-yum on IG to give me the push I needed. I have some very awesome friends with some very impatient squash (_squashes? squashi? I think I’m overthinking this!_) awaiting this recipe. I had to deliver!\n\nWithout further ado, here’s my  all-time favorite butternut squash recipe. Hands-down. No question.\n\nThis savory sweet side dish is perfect for the holidays and you should totally make it right now!\n\nWell, make it now, and then make it AGAIN for the holidays.\n\nAll of them.\n\n_Duh._\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta One Pan Sheet Pan Recipe](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-0208.jpg)\n\nso . . . how is it?!\n--------------------\n\nDelightfully delicious! The combination of sweetness from the butternut squash and honey paired perfectly with the tart and juicy cranberries is a thing of beauty!\n\nThe dish is super customizable too, so feel free to make it as sweet or sassy as you’d like. The feta adds a delightful twist, and can easily be swapped for an uber creamy goat cheese as well. I hope you love this tasty holiday side dish as much as we do! It’s become a staple in our house and I have a feeling it will be for years to come!\n\nThis simple side can be whipped up with just a few fresh ingredients and is loaded with Fall flavor.\n\nAs an added bonus, as the butternut squash roasts away it fills the house with the most delicious aromas. I had to hold myself back from climbing in the oven with it after the twenty minute mark. It was a little less Sylvia Plath and a little more was more “_LET ME AT THAT SQUASH!_” I may have stolen a few cubes to munch on when I added the cranberries. _So good!_\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta - This sweet and savory side dish is perfect for the holidays and loaded with Fall flavor!](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-feta-recipe-thanksgiving-0245-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 3 lb large butternut squash (peeled + chopped)\n*   ▢ 1-2 TBSP [extra virgin olive oil](https://amzn.to/2QvhPq6)\n*   ▢ salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste\n*   ▢ 1-2 cups fresh cranberries (add a little, or a lot!)\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP honey plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ ¼ cup finely crumbled feta\n*   ▢ ground cinnamon to taste \n*   ▢ fresh or dried parsley to garnish, optional\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F.\n    \n*   Lightly drizzle or spritz a baking sheet with olive oil.\n    \n*   Add cubed squash to the sheet along with another drizzle of olive oil.\n    \n*   Sprinkle with a light layer of salt, pepper, and garlic powder, based on taste preference.\n    \n*   Roast at 400 F for 25 minutes on the center rack.\n    \n*   At the 25 minute mark, pull out the oven rack, and add your fresh cranberries to the roasting pan.\n    \n*   Return to the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cranberries have started to soften and burst a bit, resembling really juicy craisins vs fresh firm cranberries.\n    \n*   Remove from oven and add a sprinkle of cinnamon (approx. 1/8-1/4 tsp depending on preference) along with feta and honey. I listed the honey measurements I used, but depending on whether you used fresh cranberries or dried, sweeten to taste.\n    \n*   Garnish with parsley for a burst of color and dig in while it's hot!\n    \n\nFeel free to use fresh or dried cranberries for this dish.\n\nDried will be sweeter, while fresh with have a delightful punch of tartness to pair with the buttery squash and sweet honey.

I still bake with it because it’s an awesome natural sweetener and I adore it so, but if I have the option to keep it as close to raw as possible, I do. Hence adding the honey after roasting the squash and cranberries in this recipe. The fruit and veggie medley is still just warm enough to allow the honey to cover the dish as a deliciously sweet glaze, but not so scorching that it’s spending 30+ minutes in my oven losing all it’s fabulous benefits.\n\n_File this under things I tell myself so I can eat more honey._\n\nIf you’re as squash obsessed as I am right now, you should totally take your Fall/Winter menu up a few notches and try my [Cheesy Garlic Parmesan Spaghetti Squash](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/09/cheesy-garlic-parmesan-spinach-spaghetti-squash.html) and Butternut Cauliflower Soup.\n\nSO DELICIOUS!\n\nIf you get a chance to try this Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta, let me know!\n\nYou can leave me a comment here (LOVE checking those daily!) or tag @PEASandCRAYONS #PEASANDCRAYONS on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peasandcrayons) so I can happy dance over your creations!

I’ve done some experimenting and here’s what I’ve got so far!\n\nI’ve found the best advance-prep results were when I pre-roasted the squash for around 25-30 minutes and then before serving, I tossed the room temperature squash back in the oven along with the cranberries for an additional 10 minutes or so until the cranberries started to burst and the squash crisped back up around the edges (yet still creamy and buttery on the inside!). I reheated it in the oven just before serving so the feta and honey were added to the still-warm dish and it worked great!\n\nI have also cooked the squash and berries in their entirety and popped them in the fridge. I let it come to room temp for a bit then reheated them in the oven for around 10 minutes before serving, adding the cheese/honey after as well. The first method had more of the texture I was looking for but the results from this method were still good!\n\nLet me know if you find another method that works great for you as well!\n\nLast year I even slapped the leftover honey roasted butternut squash with cranberries on an epic Thanksgiving leftover sandwich (with all the fixings) and it was amazing!\n\nPeas and Crayons is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites at no cost to readers.\n\n[![Jenn Laughlin Headshot Photo - About the Author](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jenn-laughlin-headshot-peasandcrayons--scaled-e1716318471546-600x600.jpg)](https://peasandcrayons.com/about)\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nJenn Laughlin\n-------------\n\nJenn Laughlin created Peas and Crayons in 2009 after graduating with B.S. in Dietetics from Florida State University while working as a Nutrition Educator for WIC.

Using a meat mallet or the bottom of your fry pan, pound breasts to even thickness (you don't want the meat super-flat, just even in thickness). Place the prepared chicken in a large sealable plastic bag and set aside.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon lime zest, 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, minced garlic, honey, cumin, coriander, and salt and pepper (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of each; add to your preference). Once the mixture is well combined, remove 3 tablespoons of the mixture and reserve for later.\n    \n*   Add the rest of the marinade to the bag with the chicken. Seal the bag and then knead with your hands to ensure all of the chicken is well coated. Place in the fridge and marinate for at least 30 minutes and preferably 2-3 hours. Don't marinate longer than 6 hours. (Acid from lime begins to \"cook\" the chicken.)\n    \n*   Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (about 400 degrees F.). Generously oil the grill (I drench a roll-up paper towel in vegetable oil and, holding it with tongs, rub it over the grill grates. Don't skip this step.) Start by grilling the pineapple **(See Note 1)** so you can work on the salsa while the chicken cooks. Rub about 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil over all sides of the pineapple. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.\n    \n*   Remove chicken from marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.\n    \n*   While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.\n    \n*   We like to serve Pineapple Chicken with coconut rice or cilantro-lime rice. If you'd like those recipes, check for the links to those recipes right above this recipe card!\n    \n\n**Note** **1**: You don't have to grill the pineapple, but it does add an amazing sweetness (it caramelizes as it grills) to the dish. Check pictures in the post for the size of pineapple to grill. (I cut the cored and peeled the pineapple and cut into about 9 or 10 long strips.) Once grilled, I slice each pineapple strip in 3 long strips and then dice those long strips into small pieces for the salsa. Use a sharp knife here! You will likely have more pineapple salsa than needed to top chicken, but we like a lot--or finish the rest off with chips. You can halve the pineapple salsa recipe, but I like it as written, so I don't waste the rest of the veggies.\n\n**Note 2**: A good, ripe avocado adds a delicious creamy element to this dish. If you don't add avocado and want a creamy element, I'd recommend the [jalapeno sauce from this recipe](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/jamaican-jerk-tacos/).

All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\n\n![Chickpea, roasted vegetable, and grain salad in a large bowl](https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,g_center,w_730,h_913/k%2Farchive%2F34ef39bbfe74b678984b82ea6816b61de2913ab8)\n\nIt’s several days after [Thanksgiving](https://www.thekitchn.com/all-thanksgiving-recipes-22957573), and I’m still very much in holiday eating mode. We ate leftovers for every meal on Friday, switched it up with [tacos](https://www.thekitchn.com/beef-taco-recipe-23020688) on Saturday, and ordered [pizza](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-really-good-pizza-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-178384) on Sunday because we still didn’t feel like cooking. The next few days for lunch will probably be more leftovers, because I can’t see beyond the mountain of plastic-wrapped [mashed potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-180434) and [stuffing](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-the-very-best-thanksgiving-stuffing-237564) in the fridge to even try and dig for a fresh vegetable.\n\nWhen I do break free and get back to some type of normalcy, I know exactly what I’ll be eating to help me reset. This vegetarian cauliflower rice bowl is packed with all my favorite healthy foods, and it’s the perfect meal to enjoy throughout December. **It has ingredients of [cauliflower rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/trader-joes-cauliflower-rice-recipes-265085), [sweet potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-sweet-potato-recipes-261990), [pepitas](https://www.thekitchn.com/pepitas-vs-pumpkin-seeds-23416957), [feta cheese](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-feta-recipes-23147049) – all roasts together in the oven, then pile them onto [roasted vegetables](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221).**\n\nThe Cheap & Easy Lunch Bowl I’ll Be Meal Prepping All Month\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter cooking a giant Thanksgiving meal and spending the following days indulging, I want a lunch that’s fresh, healthy, quick to pull together, and easy on the wallet — after all, I have holiday gifts to buy!\n\nThis lunch bowl checks all those boxes. Everything roasts together in the oven: big cubes of [sweet potato](https://www.thekitchn.com/roasted-sweet-potatoes-263158), crunchy pepitas, and even oversized crumbles of feta, which take on this wonderful chewy-creamy texture when warmed. Instead of sautéing the [cauliflower rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice-couscous-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203344) (buy it pre-riced to save time), you’ll also throw it into the oven. Tossing it with [turmeric](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipes-with-turmeric-223795) gives it a gorgeous golden hue and a slightly earthy flavor.\n\nWhile everything’s roasting, you’ll mix up a fresh bean salad: a [can of chickpeas](https://www.thekitchn.com/chickpea-recipes-234833), a handful of [herbs](https://www.thekitchn.com/your-guide-to-storing-fresh-herbs-in-the-fridge-231412), a drizzle of [olive oil](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-olive-oil-and-extra-virgin-olive-oil-word-of-mouth-218767), and a squeeze of [lime juice](https://www.thekitchn.com/5-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-juice-from-limes-amp-lemons-tips-from-the-kitchn-119886). Pile onto the [roasted veg](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221), then enjoy for lunch right after it’s made or divvy into lunch containers and eat throughout the week. You don’t even need to futz with a dressing — just drizzle with more oil and a squeeze a lime juice before diving in.\n\nThe flexibility of this recipe makes it extra budget-friendly. Use whatever root vegetable you have on hand or is on sale at the grocery store. Buy pepitas in the bulk section, or swap out another nut or seed that’s already stashed in your pantry. It’s delicious any way you make it.\n\n[Comments](#comments-263225)\n\nAn easy, protein-packed vegetarian lunch bowl made with cauliflower rice, sweet potatoes, and a vibrant chickpea salad.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    root vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, or a combination, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes\n    \n*   4 tablespoons\n    \n    olive oil, divided, plus more for serving\n    \n*   1 1/2 teaspoons\n    \n    kosher salt, divided\n    \n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n    \n*   4 ounces\n    \n    feta cheese, drained\n    \n*   1/4 cup\n    \n    pumpkin seeds\n    \n*   3 cups\n    \n    fresh or frozen cauliflower rice, such as Trader Joe's\n    \n*   1/2 teaspoon\n    \n    ground turmeric\n    \n*   1 (15.5-ounce) can\n    \n    chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1/2 cup\n    \n    coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems\n    \n*   Finely grated zest of 2 medium limes\n    \n*   Juice of 2 medium limes, plus more wedges for serving\n    \n*   1\n    \n    medium avocado, pitted and quartered\n    \n\n1.  Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to 425°F. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, then season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and several grinds of black pepper. Toss to combine, then arrange into an even layer. Roast on the lower rack until beginning to brown, about 20 minutes.\n    \n2.  Flip the sweet potatoes and push them to one side. Add the pumpkin seeds to the now-empty portion of the baking sheet and crumble the feta into large pieces over the sweet potatoes. Place the cauliflower rice (if using frozen, break up any clumps first), turmeric, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and several grinds of black pepper on a second rimmed baking sheet and toss until evenly combined. Spread into an even layer.\n    \n3.  Place the sweet potatoes on the upper rack and the cauliflower rice on the lower rack. Roast until the pumpkin seeds are toasted, the sweet potatoes are golden-brown, and the feta is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl and toss until evenly coated; set aside.\n    \n4.  **For each serving:** Transfer 1/4 of the rice, 1/4 of the sweet potato and feta mixture, and 1/4 of the chickpea mixture into a bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the pepitas and top with a piece of the avocado (peel the avocado if eating immediately). Drizzle with more olive oil and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve with a lime wedge.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Storage:** Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."

Double cream has a **butterfat percentage of 48%**. It is so high that it is easily over whipped and quickly will turn to butter. Double cream is not commonly found in the United States but check with your local dairy to see if they offer it.\n\n**Heavy cream** or **heavy whipping cream** contains the next highest butterfat percentage at **36-38%.** This recipe calls for heavy cream but if you can't find heavy cream, **whipping cream** is your next best substitute at **30% butterfat.**\n\n![](https://www.savoringthegood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/61d9acd099004daddf058ab0d5dd0cfe.jpg)\n\nDelicious!👌🏼\n--------------\n\n_Pinterest: Chris D_\n\nHow do you make IKEA Swedish meatballs?\n---------------------------------------\n\n![3 photos showing how to make the meatballs for swedish meatballs from Ikea](https://www.savoringthegood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/how-to-make-swedish-meatballs.jpg)\n\n1.

In a heavy-bottomed frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.( if not using the pan you cooked the meatballs in. **If using the one-pan method, no butter is needed as the drippings from the meatballs will serve in place of the butter.** **Remove the cooked meatballs from the frying pan and place on a clean plate while you make the sauce** **in the pan you pulled from the oven.**\n2.  **Whisk in the flour** and continue cooking, stirring continuously, for 2 minutes, **allowing the flour to cook** and bubble.\n3.

It’s time to change that. Because I love cauliflower. And I’m pretty sure that a lot of you guys do too. \n\n![Overhead close up of bowl of quinoa salad in grey bowl with spoon topped with avocado.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cauliflower-salad-chickpeas-quinoa-tahini-dressing-11-683x1024.jpg)\n\nI make this [Roasted Miso Cauliflower](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/miso-roasted-cauliflower/) often as a side dish. And I love swapping cauliflower rice in recipes to make them low-carb. But today I’m bringing on the **Cauliflower Salad**.\n\nWhy you’ll love it\n------------------\n\n*   Roasted Chickpeas\n*   Fluffy [Quinoa](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/how-to-cook-perfect-quinoa-in-the-instant-pot/)\n*   Delicious Avocado\n*   Creamy Tahini Dressing\n\nCan we just talk about this dressing for a sec? It’s dreamy…\n\nGarlicky, lemony, nutty – with just a hint of sweetness from some maple syrup. You could basically drizzle it on anything and it would taste good. \n\nBut we’re drizzling it on some roasted chickpeas and cauliflower that are tossed with quinoa and avocado. \n\n**It’s basically heaven in a bowl.** \n\n[![Overhead close up of bowl of quinoa salad in grey bowl with spoon topped with avocado.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cauliflower-salad-chickpeas-quinoa-tahini-dressing-6.jpg)](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/cauliflower-salad-chickpeas-quinoa-tahini-dressing-6/)\n\nIngredients needed\n------------------\n\n*   Cooked Quinoa – I love making my [quinoa in the Instant Pot](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/how-to-cook-perfect-quinoa-in-the-instant-pot/)!\n*   Cauliflower – I used 1 medium head of cauliflower for this recipe.\n*   Canned Chickpeas – Or, swap in these (no soak!)

Cut any larger florets into bite sized pieces. \n\n![Cut cauliflower in grey bowl. ](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cauliflower-tacos-1-683x1024.jpg)\n\nHow to make it\n--------------\n\n*   Preheat your oven to 450-degrees.\n*   Combine cauliflower, chickpeas, olive oil and spices in a large bowl.

Set aside to cool slightly, while you prepare the dressing.\n*   Combine the cauliflower-chickpea mixture with cooked quinoa. Top with avocado and parsley. Drizzle with tahini dressing and toss gently to combine.\n\nHow to make the tahini dressing\n-------------------------------\n\nJust whisk everything together and then season with salt and pepper. You may need to add in some water to get the consistency you’re looking for. I like my dressing on the thick side, but thin enough to drizzle. \n\n![Tahini salad dressing ingredients on countertop.](https://www.platingsandpairings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cauliflower-salad-chickpeas-quinoa-tahini-dressing-4.jpg)\n\nHow to make ahead & store\n-------------------------\n\n*   To make this cauliflower quinoa salad ahead of time, I like to toss the cauliflower, chickpeas, quinoa and parsley, but leave the dressing on the side.

    "markdown": "# Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce. - Half Baked Harvest\nThis post may contain affiliate links, please see our [privacy policy](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/privacy-policy/) for details.\n\nBringing you all some springtime vibes with these Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce. Grilled Greek chicken (or roasted), served bowl style with orzo, roasted peppers, avocado, feta cheese, cucumbers, and the most deliciously addicting sizzled mint goddess sauce. It doesn’t get easier or more delicious than this grilled chicken…simple, quick, extra colorful, super flavorful, and so delicious. The perfect dinner to serve any night of the week!\n\n![overhead photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and olive on table](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-1-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nBasically I am full on ready for summer, and this recipe proves it. I know it’s only mid April, but in my defense, I feel like most everyone (in the US at least) is slowly beginning to experience warmer days that are fit for grilling. Are you? My fingers are crossed that you are, but if not, don’t worry, you can easily roast this chicken too!\n\nEither way, this is the perfect recipe for Monday. It also feels very April appropriate – healthy, colorful, and delicious! All very important things.\n\nWith Easter this Sunday, I have Greek food on my mind. Something about Easter always inspires me to create recipes with a Greek influence. I say influence because I know that my recipes may not be traditional, but this is my personal spin on a more traditional recipe.\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5032-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5052-700x1050.jpg)\n\nLast year I even made my first [spanakopita](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-spinach-and-feta-pie-spanakopita/ \"Greek Spinach and Feta Pie (Spanakopita).\") (Greek spinach and feta pie), along with these [Greek orzo stuffed peppers](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-orzo-stuffed-red-peppers/ \"Greek Orzo Stuffed Red Peppers with Lemony Basil Tomatoes.\")! Both of which are some of my favorite spring and summer recipes. And then there’s these [Greek lamb meatballs](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/greek-lamb-meatballs-with-avocado-goddess-sauce/ \"Greek Lamb Meatballs with Avocado Goddess Sauce.\"), which so many of you have made and seem to have loved. Those meatballs inspired this recipe. Ever since I made those meatballs a year ago, I have been obsessed with the recipe. I make it every chance I get, which honestly is not often enough, as I’m consistently testing new recipes.\n\nPoint is, I love the flavors so very much, but more often than not I end up having chicken on hand opposed to ground lamb. Soo, enter the chicken version of these bowls. But made in a very different way, because well, I never seem to make the same recipe twice. Both bowls are SO GOOD, but right now I am all about this Greek chicken.\n\nAnd it feels kind of fitting for Easter, doesn’t it?\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5054-700x1050.jpg)\n\n![Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5X9A5065-700x1050.jpg)\n\nI marinate the chicken in quite possibly one of my favorite marinades. It’s a combination of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika (which is not really “Greek”…but it’s good), fresh oregano, shallots (the secret!), garlic, and lots of lemon (always so much lemon). Now, when I say marinate, I really just mean toss the chicken in this mix and let it sit while you get everything else for the bowls together. I’m not sure about you guys, but I can never plan ahead enough to cook a recipe requiring a long marinate time.\n\nIt almost never happens…\n\nSo, I do a quick marinade. It works.\n\n![close up photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-2-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nWhile the chicken is “marinating”, make the sizzled mint goddess sauce.\n\nHere’s the truth, I really do not love mint. I find it overpowers most recipe. Unless it’s a [cocktail](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/category/recipes/drinks/), in which case I think mint is perfect, did you see these [mojitos](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/white-tea-and-muddled-basil-mojito/ \"White Tea and Muddled Basil Mojito.\")? Mint used in savory dishes however, well it throws me off. Until today. Cooking mint in olive oil really mellows out the flavor and makes the mint much less pungent. I found it to be perfect when stirred into a yogurt based goddess sauce. Which I am now spooning over everything, so addicting. Roasted salmon and potatoes are especially delicious.\n\nOnce the sauce is made and the chicken is grilled, it’s assembly time! I used orzo pasta as my grain, but feel free to use quinoa, couscous, or brown rice. Any would be great.\n\nI then layered in some roasted red peppers, avocado, cucumbers, olives, and even some arugula. Lots of veggies… and a good amount of feta cheese too.\n\nSuper pretty, on the (very) healthy side, and so very delicious.\n\n![side angled photo of Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce and fork in bowl ](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Greek-Lemon-Chicken-Bowls-with-Sizzled-Mint-Goddess-Sauce-4-700x1050.jpg \"Greek Lemon Chicken Bowls with Sizzled Mint Goddess Sauce | halfbakedharvest.com #chicken #grilled #healthyrecipes #easyrecipes\")\n\nThe added bonus about this recipe is that it’s so great for weekday meal prep. I recommend making this on a Sunday or Monday night and doubling the recipe. Then simply use the leftovers to make lunch or dinner bowls to enjoy throughout the week!\n\nCook everything at once…get multiple meals…love that!\n\nSo excited to be sharing this recipe with you guys.

    "markdown": "# Cilantro Lime Chicken {With a Mango Salsa!} - Chelsea's Messy Apron\n[Skip to content](#content)\n\n**Cilantro Lime Chicken** is both simple and flavorful! Pair it with cilantro-lime rice and mango avocado salsa for a delicious, healthy meal.\n\n ![Cilantro Lime Chicken on a bed of rice with fresh salsa.](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CILANTRO-LIME-CHICKEN-CHELSEASMESSYAPRON-1200-2.jpeg)\n\nThe marinade for this Cilantro-Lime Chicken is everything a good marinade should be: it’s easy to whip together, has so much flavor, and doesn’t contain any “strange” ingredients. This recipe also pairs really well with my [mango salsa-](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-mango-salsa/)\\-I always make it as a side when I make this dish. I’d recommend giving it a shot!\n\n ![All the ingredients for this recipe prepped out for easy assembly.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201300'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nHow To Make Cilantro-Lime Chicken\n---------------------------------\n\n1.  **Whisk together the marinade**: Remove about 1/2 cup of the marinade (we’ll use it later).\n2.  **Prep** **the chicken**: You want to pound chicken breasts to an even thickness so they’ll cook evenly later on. This is best accomplished by a [meat mallet](https://amzn.to/2SS6sbV).\n3.  **Marinate**: Place the chicken in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.\n4.  **Cook**: Grill, bake, or saute the chicken until it reaches 165 degrees F. (Take the guesswork out by using a [digital meat thermometer.](https://amzn.to/2TeVMZ3))\n5.  **Baste**: As you cook the chicken, brush it occasionally with the reserved marinade mix. \n\n ![The marinade being whisked together and added to the chicken for this cilantro lime chicken recipe.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nRecipe Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Make sure to **slice the chicken in half, or pound it** to an even thickness _before_ marinating. This allows the chicken to soak up more flavor from the marinade (improves taste), and the even thickness will allow it to cook evenly.\n*   If grilling, **generously oil your grill grates**. I do this by rolling up a few paper towels, drenching them in oil (I use canola), and using tongs, rub the drenched paper towels along the grill grates. Doing this will contribute to a beautiful sear, and ensure the chicken doesn’t stick to the grates.\n*   If grilling, **fully** **preheat** **your** **grill.** I know it’s hard to wait, but adding meat to a fully preheated grill will sear the surface of the meat–and that gives you a juicier chicken. It also allows the chicken to get a great char.\n*   As the chicken is cooking, **brush the reserved marinade on the chicken**. Doing this will further enhance the flavor.\n*   Once it’s finished, **let the cooked chicken rest**, tented with foil, for 5-10 minutes before cutting in!\n\n ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20105%20134'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n### QUICK TIP\n\nMangoes have a large pit inside and that makes it tricky to slice them. Here’s a helpful visual guide: [how to cut a mango.](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/how-to-cut-a-mango/)\n\n ![The mango salsa being mixed together in a bowl.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nMake It A Meal\n--------------\n\nOne of the things I love about this recipe is how easily it pairs with other sides. Below are a few of my favorites to serve with this meal:\n\n*   **Mango-avocado salsa**: The salsa has an outstanding texture that pairs perfectly with Cilantro-Lime Chicken.  The sweetness of the mango and the orange juice perfectly balance the tang of all the cilantro and lime from the chicken marinade. Check out the [mango salsa](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-mango-salsa/) recipe or find it in the recipe card below as well.\n*   **Cilantro-Lime Chicken and Rice**: Serve Cilantro-Lime Chicken over cilantro-lime quinoa or rice for an amazing meal. I’ve included my favorite recipe for cilantro lime rice (or quinoa) in the recipe notes section.\n*   **Cilantro-Lime Chicken Taco Salad**: To convert this recipe into a salad, finely chop some romaine lettuce, add the (cooled) chopped chicken, your favorite veggies (such as cherry tomatoes, chopped bell peppers, cucumber, etc.), and the dressing from this [quinoa black bean salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/quinoa-black-bean-salad/).\n\n ![The cilantro lime rice being made in a pot to go with the cilantro lime chicken.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nAlternate Cooking Methods\n-------------------------\n\nCooking times will vary, depending on several factors, so I always recommend using a thermometer to test your chicken as it cooks. Aim to hit exactly 165 degrees F. (Undercooked = unsafe; Overcooked = dry chicken)\n\n*   **Baked Cilantro-Lime Chicken:** Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Place chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Bake for approximately 18 minutes, flipping the chicken halfway through. Remove from the oven, and loosely cover the sheet pan with foil.  Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes.\n*   **Sautéed Cilantro-Lime Chicken:** Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken breast(s) and cook for 4-6 minutes per side until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear. As you sauté the chicken, brush it generously with the reserved marinade. Transfer the chicken to a clean plate, loosely cover with foil, and let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes.\n\n ![The Cilantro Lime Chicken on a bed of rice with fresh mango salsa on it ready to be enjoyed.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%201800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nCilantro-Lime Chicken Sides\n---------------------------\n\n*   [Fruit Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/blackberry-lime-fruit-salad-with-orange-zest/) (Rave reviews!)\n*   [Mandarin Orange Salad](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/orange-apple-salad-with-an-orange-poppyseed-dressing/) (Best dressing!)\n*   [Roasted Brussel Sprouts](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-parmesan-brussels-sprouts/) (Reader favorite!)\n*   [Roasted Sweet Potatoes](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/roasted-sweet-potatoes/) (Incredible seasoning blend!)\n*   [Grilled Corn on the Cob](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/perfectly-grilled-corn-on-the-cob-recipe-1956289)\n\n### Chicken Marinade\n\n*   ▢ 1-1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)\n*   ▢ 3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, plus 1 tsp zest\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup olive oil\n*   ▢ 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, plus 1 tsp zest\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon honey\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 2-1/2 tablespoons regular soy sauce\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons minced garlic\n*   ▢ 1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro,\n*   ▢ 1 tsp [salt](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Morton-Salt-Fine-Sea-Salt-Fast-Dissolving-for-Marinades-Soups-and-Dressings-17-6-oz-Canister/10849552?athbdg=L1100&from=/search) & 1/4 tsp [pepper](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GV-CLUB-BLCK-PPR-I/46861995?athbdg=L1100&from=/search)\n\n*   **MARINADE:** Whisk together all of the marinade ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Reserve about 1/2 cup of marinade, and pour the rest into a large resealable bag.\n    \n*   **CHICKEN**: Trim the chicken of fat. Pound the breasts to even thickness or slice in half to get evenly sized breasts and place in the bag with the rest of the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, making sure to flip the bag halfway through. I recommend marinating for 2-6 hours.\n    \n*   **COOK CHICKEN: The instructions below are to grill the chicken. To see other methods of cooking chicken, read the portion of the post that is right above this recipe card.** Lightly oil the grill grate or grill ridges on a grill pan or add 1 tablespoon oil to a skillet and then place the marinated chicken on the grill. Discard leftover marinade.\n    \n*   **COOK, CONT.**: Grill for 10-12 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and internal temperature is at 165 degrees F. Flip the chicken halfway and brush it generously with the reserved 1/2 cup marinade.\n    \n*   **MANGO SALSA:** Prepare [mango-avocado salsa](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/best-mango-salsa/).\n    \n*   **RICE**: If desired, prepare cilantro-lime or coconut rice.\n    \n*   **ASSEMBLY:** Serve grilled chicken over a bed of rice (if prepared) and add spoonfuls of the salsa on top. Enjoy immediately!\n    \n\nCooking times will vary, depending on several factors, so I always recommend using a thermometer to test your chicken as it cooks. Aim to hit exactly 165 degrees F.

Wash and chop fresh spinach, or thaw and drain frozen spinach.\n2.  **Cook the Pasta Shells**: Boil salted water and cook jumbo pasta shells until al dente. Drain and set aside.\n\n![Spinach and ricotta filling for shells.](https://saltedmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ricotta-Stuffed-Shells-2-2.jpg)\n\n3.  **Prepare the Filling**:\n    *   Heat olive oil over medium heat in a skillet. Sauté minced garlic until fragrant.\n    *   Add spinach and cook until wilted (fresh) or heated through (frozen). Season with salt and pepper.\n    *   Combine ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, egg, nutmeg (if using), and the spinach mixture. Mix well.\n4.  **Assemble the Dish**:\n    *   Spread marinara sauce at the bottom of a baking dish.\n    *   Stuff pasta shells with the cheese and spinach mixture. Place seam side up in the dish.\n    *   Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the stuffed shells. Sprinkle extra mozzarella on top.\n5.  **Bake**:\n    *   Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.\n    *   Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.\n\n💡 **Chef's Guide: Expert Tips**\n--------------------------------\n\nDrawing from a decade in Michelin-starred kitchens and Cordon Bleu training, here are my top tips for recipe success.\n\n*   **Perfectly Cooked Shells**: Ensure pasta shells are cooked al dente to avoid becoming mushy during baking.\n*   **Squeeze Spinach Well**: If using frozen spinach, make sure to squeeze out all excess water to prevent the filling from becoming too watery.\n*   **Layering Sauce**: A layer of marinara sauce at the bottom prevents the shells from sticking and adds extra flavor.\n*   **Extra Cheese**: For an extra cheesy top, add mozzarella or even provolone cheese before the final 10 minutes of baking.\n\n📖 Substitutions & Variations\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **Cheese Variations**: Substitute ricotta with mascarpone or add provolone for extra cheesiness.\n*   **Gluten-Free**: Use gluten-free pasta shells to make the dish suitable for gluten-intolerant guests.\n*   **Spice it Up**: Add red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture or sprinkle on top before baking for some heat.\n*   **Herb Substitutions**: Swap basil or parsley with oregano or thyme for a different herbal note.\n\n🍯 **Storing and reheating leftovers**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   **Fridge:** Store any leftover ricotta stuffed shells in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n*   **Freezer:** Place the stuffed shells in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them individually before transferring them to a freezer-safe container or bag. They can be frozen for up to 2-3 months.\n*   **Reheat:**\n    *   **From the fridge**: Reheat in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 20 minutes or until heated through.\n    *   **From the freezer**: If frozen, thaw overnight in the fridge before reheating as described above.\n\n❓**Recipe FAQ's**\n-----------------\n\n**Can I make this dish ahead of time?**\n\nAbsolutely! You can prepare the stuffed shells, refrigerate them, and bake just before serving.  \n\n**Can I use other types of cheese besides ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan?**\n\nYes, you can experiment with other cheeses. Fontina or provolone can be a good substitute for mozzarella, and cottage cheese or mascarpone can be used instead of ricotta.  \n\n**I'm gluten-free. Can I use gluten-free pasta shells for this recipe?**\n\nAbsolutely! Many gluten-free jumbo pasta shell options are available in stores. Just ensure you follow the cooking instructions on the package, as gluten-free pasta can have a different cooking time and texture.  \n\n**Can I add meat to this dish?**\n\nYes, ground beef, Italian sausage, or even ground turkey can be cooked and mixed into the marinara sauce or combined with the cheese filling for a meaty variation.  \n\n**Try these easy easy sauces with your ricotta stuffed shells:**\n\n*   [\n    \n    The Best Pomodoro Sauce\n    \n    ](https://saltedmint.com/pomodoro-sauce/)\n*   [\n    \n    Quick and Easy Roasted Red Pepper Sauce\n    \n    ](https://saltedmint.com/really-useful-roasted-red-pepper-sauce/)\n*   [\n    \n    The BEST Authentic Arrabbiata Sauce\n    \n    ](https://saltedmint.com/homemade-store-cupboard-classic-arrabbiata-sauce/)\n\nDid you make these **ricotta stuffed shells**?

    "markdown": "# Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full\n![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-42.jpg)\n\nAnother healthy, green recipe for January! Although, I feel like once it hits the second week, we all stop talking about our resolutions and whatnot. But I actually just wrote [an article for MindBodyGreen](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-28344/the-everyday-detox-what-food-to-incorporate-so-youre-always-effortlessly-cleans.html?utm_content=buffer88f32&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer) about “detoxing” and what it really means. (Although please note that I am NOT a health professional, just a humble nutrition student! Always consult your doctor before starting any dietary changes!)\n\nDetoxing was in vogue a few year ago, but now it’s kind of lost its steam as body positivity has come more into the light. Which I want to address – **you can be body positive AND want to eat healthier**. One does not preclude the other. And I am all for body positivity AND eating healthy. But it’s important to mention that TRUE detoxing happens in the body already – your body actually has a very efficient system for removing toxins. A juice cleanse is not a real detox. However, we CAN make it easier for our bodies by eating the nutrients it needs for these detoxifying processes to happen – i.e. foods that aid in digestion and elimination, foods that promote liver health, etc. But let me stress again that the foods are NOT the detox themselves – they’re just helping the body do what it already does.\n\n[  \n![](https://www.awltovhc.com/image-100239365-13925905)](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100239365-13925905)\n\nEnter this kale detox salad. The overarching principle behind this salad being a “detox” salad is that it’s super green, which means chlorophyll. I love talking about chlorophyll as a detoxifying agent because it’s one of the best things you can have for your liver. Without getting too science-y, chlorophyll helps increase the activity of Phase II Biotransformation Enzymes, which have been shown to help remove toxins and carcinogens from the body. So basically, eat green and help your liver.\n\nBut I had to make this salad delicious, because what’s the point of eating it if it’s not delicious?! It’s got roasted potatoes and carrots, brown rice for fiber, chickpeas (of course), and lacinato kale – all topped with a deliciously _chloro-filled_ (see what I did there!?) green pesto. It’s delicious, AND good for your bod! I hope you all love it!\n\n![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-41.jpg)![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-38.jpg)![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-43.jpg)![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-25.jpg)\n\n![Detox Kale Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-48-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://wellandfull.com/wprm_print/kale-detox-salad-w-pesto)\n\nKale Detox Salad w/ Pesto\n-------------------------\n\nThis kale detox salad is the perfect meal for a cleanse, made with whole, real ingredients. Made with a mouthwatering carrot top pesto and roasted vegetables.\n\nPrep Time 15 minutes\n\nCook Time 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time 1 hour\n\nServings 2 as a Main, 3-4 as a Side\n\n#### Carrot Top Pesto\n\n*   Tops of 1 Bunch Carrots\n*   1/4 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n*   1/4 Tsp Salt\n*   1/4 Tsp Pepper\n*   Juice from 1/2 a Lemon\n\n#### Roasted Veg\n\n*   1 Lb Fingerling Potatoes cut into rounds\n*   3-4 Large Purple Carrots cut into rounds\n*   1 15 oz Can Chickpeas drained and rinsed\n*   A Generous Drizzle of Olive Oil\n*   1 Tsp Salt\n*   1 Tsp Pepper\n*   1 Tsp Dried Parsley\n*   1 Tsp Dried Basil\n*   1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder\n*   Few Sprinkles of Dried Thyme\n\n#### The Rest of the Salad\n\n*   A Few Handfuls Lacinato Kale Sliced Thin\n*   1 Cup Cooked Brown Rice\n*   Sliced Jalapeño if desired\n*   Sesame Seeds if desired\n\n*   Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.\n    \n*   Prep vegetables – wash and dry carrots and potatoes. Cut both into rounds (disks), about 1/4 inch thick.\n    \n*   In a bowl, combine chopped potatoes, carrots, and chickpeas. Add in olive oil and spices, and mix well until everything is evenly coated.\n    \n*   On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake vegetables + chickpeas for 45-50 minutes. When they’re done cooking, remove from oven and let cool.\n    \n*   While vegetables are cooking, make pesto – combine all ingredients into a food processor and process on high until a slightly smooth pesto is formed.\n    \n*   In a bowl, mix thinly sliced lacinato kale and pesto until kale is evenly covered. Then, add in roasted vegetables + chickpeas and brown rice. Mix well until everything is evenly combined.\n    \n*   Serve in bowls and top with sesame seeds.\n    \n*   Enjoy!\n    \n\nIf you can’t find lacinato (Tuscan) kale, any other hardy green will do – like chard, regular kale, or collard greens.\n\nAlso, for this recipe I use my [Cuisinart Food Processor](https://amzn.to/2S0uDWo) (affiliate link). This food processor is great and I use it in my kitchen multiple times a week. I highly recommend it!\n\n![Kale Detox Salad | Well and Full | #vegan #recipe #detox #cleanse](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kale-Detox-Salad-copy-2.jpg)\n\n![Kale Detox Salad w/ Pesto | Well and Full](https://wellandfull.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wellandfull-47.jpg)\n\nQuote of the Day:\n-----------------\n\n> _Be yourself; everyone else is already taken._\n> \n> – Oscar Wilde"

[This is olive oil](https://amzn.to/3hwcVGc) is generally considered the gold standard for affordable but excellent.  \n**Parmesan:** Freshly grated parmesan is preferred here because it melts and browns extremely nicely, but the bagged pre-shredded stuff works just fine.  \n**Salt & pepper:** You don’t really need more seasoning than a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, but if you’d like to experiment with flavors, try adding a little garlic powder or Italian seasoning.\n\n![Parmesan being sprinkled on zucchini slices before baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo.jpg)\n\nHow to Make the Best Baked Parmesan Zucchini (Tips and Tricks)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Be strategic about how you slice your zucchini:** Prefer softer zucchini? Slice it into thinner rounds, around 1/4-inch thick. Like your baked zucchini on the firmer side? Cut it thicker, closer to 1/2-inch.  \n**Don’t skip the broiler:** The final step in this recipe after roasting your zucchini is to switch on the broiler and broil the rounds for just a couple minutes. This makes the cheese extra toasty and delicious. But keep a close eye on your zucchini while the broiler is going. Food under the broiler can burn very quickly, so you never want to leave your broiler unattended.\n\n![Collage photo of parmesan zucchini before and after baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-picture.jpg)\n\n### What to Serve With Cheesy Roasted Zucchini?\n\nThese bites are great alongside almost anything, particularly simple lunch sandwiches or:\n\n*   [Tomato Soup](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-tomato-soup-recipe-for-two/)\n*   [Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwiches](https://bakingmischief.com/pesto-grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Sausage Pasta](https://bakingmischief.com/creamy-sausage-pasta/)\n*   [Buttered Noodles](https://bakingmischief.com/buttered-noodles/)\n\n**Bonus Tip:** _If you have leftover [Pizza Sauce](https://bakingmischief.com/best-homemade-pizza-sauce/) or marinara sauce in your fridge, serve these as a snack and use them for dipping. You can even add chopped  pepperoni if you have it (layer it under the parmesan before baking)._ \n\n![Overhead photo of baked parmesan zucchini on a plate.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo-overhead.jpg)\n\n### More Easy Vegetable Sides\n\n*   [Roasted Zucchini](https://bakingmischief.com/roasted-zucchini/)\n*   [Butter and Garlic Green Beans](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-roasted-green-beans/)\n*   [Broccoli in the Oven](https://bakingmischief.com/broccoli-in-the-oven/)\n*   [Corn on the Cob in the Microwave](https://bakingmischief.com/microwave-corn-on-the-cob/)\n\n![Close up photo of baked parmesan zucchini on a plate.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-image-square-2-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 2 medium zucchini sliced into 1/4 to 1/2-inch rounds\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper\n*   ▢ 1 cup freshly grated parmesan pre-shredded is also fine\n\n*   Preheat oven to 450°F and line a broil-safe baking sheet with foil (optional for easier clean up).\n    \n*   Place zucchini slices on baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.

    "markdown": "# Crisp Gnocchi With Brussels Sprouts and Brown Butter Recipe\nTotal Time\n\n20 minutes\n\nRating\n\n5(18,388)\n\nNotes\n\n[Read community notes](#notes_section)\n\nFor a fantastic meal that can be ready in 20 minutes, toss together seared gnocchi and sautéed brussels sprouts with lemon zest, red-pepper flakes and brown butter. The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.\n\n* * *\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nYield:4 servings\n\n*   1pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)\n*   1lemon\n*   4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n*   Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper\n*   ½teaspoon red-pepper flakes\n*   1(18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi\n*   6tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces\n*   ½teaspoon honey\n*   Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving\n\n[Ingredient Substitution Guide](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/79-substitutions-for-cooking)\n\n##### Nutritional analysis per serving (4 servings)\n\n526 calories; 33 grams fat; 13 grams saturated fat; 0 grams trans fat; 15 grams monounsaturated fat; 2 grams polyunsaturated fat; 52 grams carbohydrates; 8 grams dietary fiber; 5 grams sugars; 11 grams protein; 697 milligrams sodium\n\nNote: The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)\n    \n2.  In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.\n    \n3.  In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.\n    \n\nRatings\n-------\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\nor to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\n### Private Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n-------------\n\nDear NY Times stylist, thanks for using my father's, Michael Lax's, teak handled, cast iron, skillet, the large one, by Copco. Great skillets, but note, if you find one, due to the selection of the teak handle, you cannot put them into the oven. My father was an industrial designer and designed/started Copco. The NYTimes ran his obituary in 1999. He was a diehard New Yorker, born and raised in the west village on Morton Street and he went to Alfred University in the Industrial Ceramics dept.\n\nRather than honey, I substituted a splash of aged balsamic for sweetness as well as a touch of acidity.\n\nThis works great with the Trader Joe’s Cauliflower Gnocchi too.\n\nThis was so good! We roasted the brussel sprouts to make them really crispy and then added them to the skillet along with a shallot and chopped garlic after crisping the gnocchi. Also topped it with a dollop of lemon zested garlic ricotta to finish. It was over the top delicious!\n\nI guess I'm the only whose brussel sprouts didn't cook in five minutes. I tried to follow this using the timing but ended up with hard brussel sprouts so I had to add liquid and let it simmer\n\nFabulous! Life required that I roast the sprouts. I prepared as directed with lemon zest and red pepper flakes. My helper popped them in oven at 425. They cooked for 25 minutes to perfection. By time I got home, I had enough time to prepare gnocchi as directed before roasting was complete.. I had to make 2 batches for crowd I was feeding - first one used 6 T butter, second batch 4T. Four was plenty. Used balsamic instead of honey. Will make again and again !\n\nI have done this with pancetta rather than butter. It's fantastic, and it also would be almost as good with butter..\n\nMade this into a true 20 min meal by baking the Brussels sprouts in the oven (15 min at 450 degrees) while simultaneously cooking the gnocchi on the stove top. Mixed them together on stovetop at the very end as recipe says. Also, 6 tablespoons of butter seems crazy - I added 2 and my gnocchi were deliciously buttery and crispy! Quick and easy, would definitely make again.\n\nMy kids only dabbled in the brussels sprouts (understandable, and: more veggies for me!), but mainly stuck to the gnocchi. My wife - hates \"cabbage-y\" things - was astonished by how good it was. In my family, this counts as a success. However: - This took much more than 20 minutes, more like 40. - I rounded up on the portions (I live in Europe and buy in grams). Nonetheless, there weren't any leftovers. Feeds four? Feeds two adults and two toddlers. Well.\n\nIf the gnocchi immediately sticking to the pan like glue freaks you out like it did me the first time, don’t worry. It will release once the butter melts (and with a nice golden brown crust). Do make sure they are completely broken up before they go into the pan though.\n\nFollowed exactly, except my sprouts were big so I quartered them. It took more than 2 min for the butter to brown but once it did, magic. Don’t skimp on the lemon zest and don’t be afraid of some bigger chunks of it after chopping — fried in the butter and honey they are a delightful contrast to the rest of the dish. Don’t overdo the Parmesan at the end, a light sprinkle does the job.\n\nWhy decide between Pancetta and Butter when you can have both?!? One of the best things I’ve cooked at home in recent memory.\n\nCooked this last night and it was delicious. Next time I would double the Brussels sprouts and roast them instead of frying (my pan isn't big enough to properly fry that many sprouts!), try reducing the amount of butter by half (there was so much butter pooled at the bottom of my bowl when we finished it off!), then add the roasted sprouts into the pan to toss with the gnocchi at the very end. We didn't add the Parm because I was lazy and didn't bring it to the table, and didn't miss it one bit!\n\nI think some aged balsamic might be a good substitute for the honey.\n\nWe loved this one! I think the secret is a cast-iron skillet. This was the first recipe I’ve ever attempted in my cast-iron, and I am now a believer! I would probably throw in some bacon next time. And a handful of toasted pinenuts.\n\nLove this recipe! I did sub the honey and red pepper flakes with Mike's Hot Honey and added some rotisserie chicken to the mix.\n\nUsed pancetta (why not?) and was somehow lacking lemon, so used orange zest instead, which was honestly fantastic. What a lovely, tasty one skillet meal.\n\nThis is one of our absolute favorites! I use Brussels Sprouts and cut down the butter a bit. A regular in our house and often doubled (even for only 2 people) to have plenty of leftovers.\n\nDidn’t expect this to work so well but it was superb - like others, perhaps doesn’t need quite that much butter… Brussels Sprouts in a fry pan - awesome trick… Gnocchi in a frypan - awesome trick…. Put them together - amazing meal!\n\nI used chickpea gnocchi for added protein- A delicious dish!\n\nOven roasted the sprouts Halved the butter Added drizzle of lemon juice to the gnocchi at the end\n\nI think I messed this up. It was delicious but messy and super gooey. The brussel sprouts were fantastic but the gnocchi were gooey. Maybe I got the wrong kind? Definitely would try again and see about adding less butter. I was left with lots of extra butter in the pan. I also added mushrooms cause I love them but they probably added extra liquid.\n\nDelicious! For those saying the brussels don’t cook, cover them first while they’re browning. We added a bit of pancetta since we had it and needed to use it up. And why not. Just cooked that first then added the brussels and carried on. Decrease the salt if you do this. We also added more red pepper since we like it. This was absolutely amazing. Half way through eating, we decided to also squeeze some lemon on some of it, and it really gave a nice lift. Make this!\n\nI'm obsessed with this recipe! Sometimes I substitute tteok (Korean rice cakes) for the gnocchi and it takes it to a whole different level.\n\nI added hot Italian sausage and nixed the lemon zest. Hot honey and a drizzle of balsamic glaze at the end and it was absolutely delicious! The timing definitely took a bit longer than what the recipe suggests, but definitely worth it!\n\nLove it, we have made this 50+ times with the following changes: 1. Roast sprouts @ 425F. The listed method is not enough time to cook all the way thru. Add them after browning butter. Protip: Preheat your baking pan! They should sizzle on contact 2. Use 4-5 tbsp butter instead of 6 3. Add 2-3 cloves minced garlic 1 min from done 4. Sub honey for hot honey\n\nThis has become a staple in our house. We have made it over 50 times at this point. But we have evolved the recipe into our own so here are my recommendations: 1. Roast your brussels sprouts cut side down @ 425F instead of sautéing. The listed method is not enough time to cook all them all the way through. Toss them in after you brown the butter. Protip: preheat your baking pan, sprouts should sizzle immediately on contact 2. Let the gnocchi get browned on all sides 3. Add a couple cloves of min\n\nVery surprised by all the positive reviews. Both dry (notice lack of any sauce other than…butter) and extremely greasy (see previous note re: butter). If I try again might boil the gnocchi prior to frying to see if it adds some moisture, halve the butter, and double the ratio of Brussels to gnocchi.\n\nThis dish had no right to be as delicious as it was! The ingredients are simple and so are the techniques you use. It doesn't all make sense on paper but it comes together wonderfully! Crunchy gnocchi and brussel sprouts. Slightly hot from the red pepper flakes, a little sweet from the honey, and with the slightest hint of lemon. And the parmesan at the end! So subtle but so good! Definitely making this again and can't wait to try with the different variations of cruciferous vegetables!\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you."

Use avocado oil, if you prefer.\n*   **lime juice** - Freshly squeezed juice is best here.\n*   **spices** - cumin, paprika, salt, pepper\n*   **garlic** - I prefer fresh, minced garlic. Use garlic powder if you are in a pinch.\n*   **Tajin seasoning** - This ingredient is not necessary but definitely recommended. It is made with ground dried chile peppers, dehydrated lime, and sea salt.\n\nThis healthy and filling salad is very easy to make. It's perfect for meal prep lunch or dinners, when you want something filling but healthy. Here is how to make it:\n\n*   Start with roasting sweet potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, and cumin. They will have a delicious Mexican flair!\n*   Add one can of rinsed and drained black beans, one can of drained whole kernel corn, chopped red onion, and 2 cups of [cooked quinoa](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/).\n*   The dressing is as simple as the salad! Whisk together olive oil, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, and Tajin seasoning. Pour over salad and toss together.\n\n![roasted sweet potato salad in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-5.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHow to roast sweet potatoes for this salad?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRoasting sweet potatoes for a salad or as a simple side dish to your meal prep dishes is very easy. Simply peel potatoes and cut them into cubes, no bigger than ½\". Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and ground cumin. Roast at 400 degrees F for 20 to 23 minutes. Use right away or cool and add to your salad. You can also store them in a container with a lid in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n\nThe dressing:\n-------------\n\nI have plenty of salad recipes with creamy dressings, either mayo-based or healthier with sour cream. For this sweet potato salad, I decided to use a simple olive oil vinaigrette that perfectly complements the potatoes, beans, and quinoa. Mix 4 to 5 tablespoons of olive oil with lime juice, salt, cumin, paprika, minced garlic, and tajin seasoning. The last one is optional but I love it in this dressing and even add a little more sprinkled over each serving.\n\n![sweet potato quinoa salad in two bowls with lime wedges](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-4.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHelpful Tips!\n-------------\n\n*   I love this salad with slightly warm quinoa and warm roasted potatoes but it is absolutely delicious chilled in the fridge and can be divided into serving containers.\n*   If using fresh corn, add it to roasting potatoes. It will give it an even more delicious flavor.\n*   If you don't like raw red onion, skip it. Use a sweet one, if you prefer.\n*   To make the salad ahead, you can keep the dressing separate in a bottle and toss it with all the ingredients before serving.\n\nMore salad recipes:\n-------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Black Bean Taco Salad Recipe\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/black-bean-taco-salad-recipe/)\n*   [\n    \n    Chickpea Quinoa Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/chickpea-quinoa-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Fresh Corn Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/fresh-corn-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Easy Broccoli Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/quick-and-easy-broccoli-salad-recipe/)\n\n[![](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pin-it-button.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/59883870031914544/)\n\n__If you like this recipe and make it,_ **_let me know in the comments_** _below!

Taking cues from Chipotle’s burrito bowl, we like to pile everything up high making for one delicious prep ahead meal!\n\nCategories\n----------\n\n![chicken fajita burrito bowl topped with bell peppers, guacamole and fresh salsa](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/Chicken-Fajita-Bowl-6.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599771028&s=c388f440ce366dcf8c5756c30af50e59)\n\nYou Asked for More Bowls, and We Are Giving Them to You.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBowls are all the rage right? [Rice bowls](https://themodernproper.com/chicken-teriyaki-sushi-bowl), [quinoa bowls](https://themodernproper.com/quinoa-bowl), [Buddha bowls](https://themodernproper.com/green-curry-buddha-bowl), burrito Bowls. Give us all the bowls! This chicken fajita bowl is one of our go-to weeknight meals. It’s healthy, easy, and balanced. Plus, it’s always a hit with the kids. A fajita burrito bowl might sound complicated, but they’re super simple. Season some chicken with [Homemade Taco Seasoning](https://themodernproper.com/homemade-taco-seasoning)—add some black beans, roasted bell peppers and all the fixings and serve over [Brown Rice](https://themodernproper.com/brown-rice) or [Cilantro Lime Rice](https://themodernproper.com/cilantro-lime-rice). Plus, it’s an ideal meal for all of you superhero meal-planners! Prep the ingredients a few days ahead, and you’ve got a customizable, buildable meal ready to go. And for a more classic take on fajitas, check out our [Chicken Fajitas](https://themodernproper.com/chicken-fajitas).  \n\n![chicken fajita rice bowl with fresh limes, black beans and guacamole](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/Chicken-Fajita-Bowl-1.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599771031&s=ca94825569c2717c81f05ba5653266ef)\n\nWhat Goes into a Burrito Bowl?\n------------------------------\n\nHonestly, in many ways a burrito bowl recipe is kind of like a suggestions list—you can load yours up with as much or as little as you want! But we always load our chicken fajita burrito bowl with:\n\n*   [Brown rice](https://themodernproper.com/brown-rice)\n*   Black beans\n*   [Fajita chicken and peppers](https://themodernproper.com/sheet-pan-chicken-fajitas)\n*   Cilantro\n*   [Pico de Gallo](https://themodernproper.com/pico-de-gallo-with-cabbage) (or store-bought salsa, in a pinch!)\n*   [Guacamole](https://themodernproper.com/perfect-guacamole)\n*   Sour cream\n\n![a glass bowl with chicken and bell peppers marinated in taco seasoning](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/sheet-pan-chicken-fajita-1.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599767859&s=d1deab573364b317d468fcfa2afd53d0)\n\nPrep-Ahead Fajita Bowls\n-----------------------\n\nTaking cues from Chipotle’s burrito bowl, we like to pile everything up high, and (also just like Chipotle) we prefer to prep the ingredients ahead of time, so that when dinner time comes, everyone can just assemble and EAT! The taco-spiced chicken breast can be easily made ahead and is an incredibly easy recipe. After that, you just need to prep all your other ingredients and store them in small containers, so they’re ready as can be!  \n\n![Sheet Pan Chicken Fajitas with lime juice, olive oil and taco seasoning.](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/sheet-pan-chicken-fajita-3.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1611952149&s=51ba70128e22bcaceb263b5f662a8dc1)\n\nAre Burrito Bowls Healthy?\n--------------------------\n\nYou betcha! We build this burrito bowl on a brown rice base, so it has a healthy start. But, if you’re trying to eat fewer carbs, a big pile of shredded romaine makes for a delicious base in place of the rice. Adding a little extra salsa and lime juice to your bowl will give it a sort of “dressing”. Once you’ve chosen your base add the proteins (chicken and beans), veggies, and healthy fats (I see you guacamole!) and you’ve got yourself a delicious, balanced dinner.  \n\n![hands holding a chicken fajita burrito bowl with black beans and guacamole](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/2018/Chicken-Fajita-Bowl-2.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599771030&s=3df69e89de21010a4a1336ed64430b5c)\n\n![close up of chicken fajita burrito bowl](https://images.themodernproper.com/billowy-turkey/production/posts/Chicken-Fajita-Bowl-7.jpg?w=1200&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1599766735&s=bfc72999c4336e1e1fb0e4c6beba3d55)\n\nTools You Will Need:\n--------------------\n\n*   [Sharp knife](https://amzn.to/2xwfTZJ) for prepping.\n*   [Large bowl](https://amzn.to/2XzNLQ3) to marinade your veggies and chicken in.\n*   [Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/2xt9f6w).

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled

roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the

your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame.\n\nLightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce remove excess

your tray and carefully turn upside down on a parchment paper lined baking tray. \n\nThe pumpkin ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. \n\nCollect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of pumpkin raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n\nAdd your fresh pumpkin ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. \n\nsage butter, apples and pecans\n------------------------------\n\nWhile your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat.  You want to stir them often or they will burn. \n\nCook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant.  Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside.\n\nNext, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat.  Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce apples and butter](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-e1541953820985.jpg)\n\nThen add your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 – 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry.\n\nOnce your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumpkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat.  Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n\n**pro tips for perfect pumpkin ravioli**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don’t want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don’t forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can’t emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don’t!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 – 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn’t seem like much but you don’t want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce bowl](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-e1541953937768.jpg)\n\n**can you make ravioli without a pasta machine?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely!

Don't!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 - 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn't seem like much but you don't want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n![](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/400dpiLogoCropped-1024x214.jpg)\n\nServing: 8g | Calories: 426.8kcal | Carbohydrates: 42.6g | Protein: 13.9g | Fat: 23.4g | Saturated Fat: 11.8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 3g | Monounsaturated Fat: 7.3g | Cholesterol: 143mg | Sodium: 723.2mg | Potassium: 164.1mg | Fiber: 3.5g | Sugar: 5.4g | Vitamin A: 3650IU | Vitamin C: 2.6mg | Calcium: 149mg | Iron: 2.4mg\n\n**Update Notes:** This post was originally published in November 2018 but was republished with an updated recipe, new photos, step by step instructions and tips in July of 2020."

We all know that around here, I like to keep Mondays fun, different, and delicious. Trust me when I say, this apple Panini fits the bill. I’m even going to go out and say that if you make this today, you’re going to have a pretty darn good (err delicious?) Monday.\n\nLet me explain, its real simple…\n\n_buttered sourdough bread_…I mean, that right there is close to perfection.\n\n_apple butter_…I used a homemade apple butter that I’ll be sharing with you all very soon, it _makes_ this Panini.\n\n_sharp cheddar cheese_…honeycrisp apple’s best friend.\n\n_buttery havarti cheese_…for its buttery flavor and major “melt” factor.\n\n_honeycrisp apples_…my very favorite apple variety.\n\ncrispy bacon…its salty, savory flavors are the perfect balance in this sweet Panini.\n\nhoney…to add just one more layer of deliciousness.\n\nfresh thyme…my current favorite herb and a favorite pairing with apples and cheddar.\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-2.jpg)\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-3.jpg)\n\nYou see? SO GOOD.\n\nI am pretty excited that the month of all things apples is finally here. To me, September is all about apples, I like to save the pumpkins for October and November. Every September I always have a million and one apple recipes I want to share with you guys, and this year is no different.\n\nI’m happy to be sharing this Panini as my very first apple recipe of the season. And while I have many more to come, this sandwich is near the top of my list of the most crave worthy, comforting, and cozy recipes.\n\nAs mentioned above, this Panini (or grilled cheese, it’s really whatever you’d like to call it) is pretty simple. You’re going to butter some bread, layer it with apple butter, cheese, fresh apples, bacon, honey, and a sprinkle of fresh thyme (lemon thyme is my favorite) and then press everything together in a Panini press ([this is my favorite](http://rstyle.me/n/cr7gdwb9wzf)). If you don’t have a Panini press, just make it on the stove top. No matter what, it’s going to be freaking-a-mazing.\n\nIt’s sweet, salty, and extra cheesy. Slice the apples thin so that they soften up while cooking and then as soon as the sandwich comes out of the Panini press, drizzle it with a touch more of honey and a sprinkle of fresh thyme. No debating this step, you just have to do it. It might not seem all that necessary, but I promise you, it’s what makes this sandwich so extra special…okay and it’s kind of a signature HBH step.\n\nDO IT.\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-4.jpg)\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-5.jpg)\n\nSpeaking of doing things, let’s go over some weekend stuff. We had some serious fall like weather int the late afternoons here, and the leaves have definitely started to turn. Autumn happens so fast up here in the mountains. The leaves are almost all off the trees by the second week of October. So you see, FAST.\n\nSince it’s was kind of chilly and cloudy later in the day on Sunday (summer mornings in the mountains are often sunny, then later in the day the clouds move in ), I decided to make a big pot of [chili](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/crockpot-beef-chili/). Along with my favorite beer bread from the [HBH cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553496395?tag=randohouseinc7986-20) (did you catch the video of this recipe on Instagram?!). While the chili slowly simmered on the stove, I did some serious online shopping damage.\n\nAhhhh. YIKES.\n\nI am not a good in store shopper, but give me a blanket and a computer and I can do some serious damage. I was shopping for both clothes and barn items for the upcoming [HBH retreat](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/half-baked-harvest-cookbook-colorado-retreat-giveaway/) here in Colorado at the end of the month. I am in need a few outfits and things for around my house. I found lots, and while I have some cute things on the way, I may have gone just a smidge overboard. What?! Like you’ve never done that before…\n\nAll I have to say is that online shopping is both amazing and scary. My finger tips love it, my credit card…not so much!\n\nAlso, I am still looking for few home items if you guys have suggestions of cute places to look. Let me know your favorite shops! I will be sharing everything I bought in this week’s Nine Favorite Things, so if interested, stay tuned!\n\nIn the meantime, I think we all know how our Monday needs to end.\n\nPick up some apples, cheese, and bread from the store, head home and make this Panini…\n\n![Honey, Apple, Cheddar, and Bacon Panini | halfbakedharvest.com @hbharvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Honey-Apple-Cheddar-and-Bacon-Panini-6.jpg)\n\nPrep Time 10 minutes\n\nCook Time 10 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings: 4 servings\n\nCalories Per Serving: 710 kcal\n\nNutritional information is only an estimate.

    "markdown": "# Grilled Potato & Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs | Paleo Recipes\n_This Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs is a summertime backyard BBQ staple around here. A must when we are entertaining. Put all other potato salads to shame with multiple layers of flavor and texture._ \n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4242/35487279212_82ab4ba8b4_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/35487279212/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4094/35268828850_383a95050c_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/35268828850/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\n**\\[This is an updated post from 2011.\\]**\n\nFor well over 6 years now this potato salad has been a staple of our summertime cookouts. Whenever we have people over, whether we are cooking up the most elaborate or the most simple of meals – this side dish stunner is my go-to.\n\nCooking up the potatoes first allows them to soften up a bit, so when they hit the grilled glistening with the Terra Delyssa olive oil, they get a golden brown char to the outside of them, while still holding their shape.\n\nTry substituting baby spinach, kale or other lettuces or greens for the arugula and even play with different vinaigrette moves, try adding in a whole grain mustard, a little lemon zest, maybe add some red pepper flakes.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4033/35268830450_4839d6d915_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/35268830450/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\nMy go-to herbs are chives and oregano but you can mix those up too, scallions instead of chives, rosemary or thyme instead of oregano. The pine nuts are a bonus crunch, but chopped walnuts or almond slices are great, too.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4238/34846902403_a59f974249_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/34846902403/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\nI promise after the first time you make a grilled potato salad, you will see all the possibilities and be hooked on it throughout the summer, as we are.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2771/5790346911_4da5eee204_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/5790346911 \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs by Tasty Yummies, on Flickr\")\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4238/34846902403_a59f974249_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/34846902403/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\n![](https://tasty-yummies.com/wp-content/uploads/35487278482_5d3502c49f_c-368x368.jpg)\n\n*   1 ½ to 2 pounds organic Yukon gold potatoes, red bliss potatoes also work\n*   1 bunch fresh arugula, regular, baby or wild\n*   4 tablespoons [Terra Delyssa Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil](http://www.terradelyssa.com/product/get/tplParam/3/language/en), divided\n*   2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar\\*\n*   2 cloves garlic, finely minced (1 small shallot thinly finely chopped is really nice instead of/or in addition to)\n*   ¼ cup finely chopped fresh chives\n*   ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh oregano\n*   1 ½ teaspoons sea salt\n*   ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to taste\n*   ¼ cup toasted pine nuts, optional\n\n*   Using a mandoline slicer, evenly slice the potatoes into 1/4\" slices, skin left on. If you do not have a mandoline slicer, you can cut them by hand, just be sure they are all similar thickness so they cook evenly.\n    \n*   Place the potato slices in a medium saucepan and cover with water, add a dash of salt. Bring them to a boil over a high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer potatoes until just fork tender, about 5-8 minutes once boiling.\n    \n*   Drain the potatoes and rinse in cold water to stop them from cooking.\n    \n*   Once cooled and drained, gently toss with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil (you need just enough to coat all the potatoes, but you don't want too much or it'll cause a flare up on the grill), and a dash each of salt and pepper, so they are all evenly coated.\n    \n*   Preheat the grill to medium-high. Add the potatoes to a nonstick grill pan, basket or wok, and place on the grill over the flames. Since the potatoes will not be in a single layer, you will want to toss them gently and often so some don't burn while others don't get browned. It will take approximately 20 minutes to cook all of the potatoes thoroughly and for them to be nicely browned. If any get caught in a hot spot and cook too quickly or begin to burn a bit, I just remove them early. If you don't want to mess with a grill basket or pan, you can cut the potatoes the long way and cook them directly on your grill in a single layer, this takes only about 5 minutes per side. (Our grill's grates are a bit too wide and we lose too many this way, so to avoid frustration we go with the pan).\n    \n*   While the potatoes are cooking, in a small bowl add the rice wine vinegar, the remaining Terra Delyssa olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, salt and pepper, mix well to combine.\n    \n*   Once the potatoes are cooked, place them in a large serving bowl, add the arugula and dressing, gently toss to combine everything. The arugula will begin to wilt a bit with the heat from the potatoes but will keep that nice crunch. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Serve.\n    \n\nchampagne, white wine or white balsamic vinegar also work here  \nrosemary, thyme or other fresh herbs are nice in this salad, too  \nLeave out garlic for low FODMAPs"

Right: Clean acorn squash.](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sausage-Stuffed-Acorn-Squash-2.png)\n\n**Roast the acorn squash:**\n\n*   Coat the acorn squash with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\n*   Place on a baking sheet, skin side down, and bake for 50-60 minutes until they’re fork tender. The roasting time will vary depending on the size of your acorn squash.\n\n![Left: Seasoned acorn squash on a baking sheet.

As it cooks, use a wooden spoon to break apart any large pieces. \n*   Remove the sausage from the pan and set it aside, leaving the fat in the skillet.\n*   Add the onions and bell pepper to the same skillet and cook for 3-5 minutes until they’re soft.

A serving size is one-half of an acorn squash per person.\n*   When you’re roasting acorn squash, look for a little caramelization around the edges. This is an easy way to add extra flavor.\n*   In this sausage and apple stuffed acorn squash recipe, I use nitrate-free sausage, which is better for you.\n\n*   **To Store**: Once your leftover acorn squash has cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n*   **To Reheat**: Reheat in a microwave or in the oven at 350°F until heated through.\n\n*   **Tender chicken or pork**: This dish is a full meal on its own, but it also pairs wonderfully with my [grilled chicken thighs](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/grilled-chicken-thighs/) or easy [oven pork chops](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/easy-oven-pork-chop-recipe/).\n*   **A seasonal salad**: A fresh, fall-inspired salad, like my [shaved Brussels sprouts salad](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprouts-salad/) is the perfect side dish to serve with sausage stuffed acorn squash.\n*   **Roasted vegetables**: Savory roasted vegetables, such as [roasted cauliflower](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/spicy-roasted-cauliflower-recipe/) or [cabbage steaks](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/cabbage-steak-recipe/) provide a nice balance to the sweetness in this recipe.\n\n*   **Add grains:** To make this dish even more satisfying, add a whole grain to the filling, such as [wild rice](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-wild-rice-recipe/) or [quinoa](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/how-to-make-fluffy-quinoa/).\n*   **Top with cheese:** A salty, melty cheese would be so yummy on top. Try a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese or crumbled goat cheese.\n*   **Switch up the squash:** Enjoy all the winter squash while it’s in season and make a variation of this recipe with your favorite squash variety such as delicata squash. See my [stuffed butternut squash with Italian sausage](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/italian-sausage-stuffed-butternut-squash/) recipe for inspiration!\n*   **Nut:** top this recipe with your favorite nut such as [pecans](https://amzn.to/47GYtFJ), [almonds](https://amzn.to/47D4GCH) or [walnut](https://amzn.to/416CC87).\n\n*   [Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3Ro9Hta): The squash is roasted on a standard 9×13 baking sheet.\n*   [Skillet](https://amzn.to/3R4pZFX): A large skillet is needed to cook the filling.\n*   [Knife](https://amzn.to/47Zsj8j): This recipe requires some chopping, so you’ll need a nice sharp knife.\n\n****How do I prepare acorn squash?****\n\nFirst, you’ll want to start with a good acorn squash. Look for one that is dark green in color, heavy for its size, and has no blemishes. Then, using a sharp knife, you’ll cut the squash in half between one of the ridges. Because of its shape, acorn squash is easier to cut if you place it on a towel to hold it steady. Next, you’ll remove the stem and scoop out the pulp and seeds. Now, your squash is ready to roast and fill with your favorite ingredients!\n\n****Can I eat the skin of an acorn squash?****\n\nYes, you can! After roasting acorn squash, the skin becomes soft and tender enough to cut with a fork. However, if you’d rather not eat the skin, you can easily separate it from everything else and just enjoy the inside of the acorn squash.\n\n****Could I use another vegetable instead of acorn squash?****\n\nYou can create endless variations of this recipe using different vegetables. You’ll want to choose vegetables that are sturdy enough to hold the stuffing when they’re cooked, like bell peppers, eggplant, or potatoes. Other varieties of squash like butternut squash or zucchini also work great.\n\nMore Delicious Squash Recipes\n-----------------------------\n\nWant more seasonal recipes?

Log in here.\n\nIt’s an easy recipe that cooks in **one pan**, but the moment you take a bite, you will want to hire yourself to be head chef in an Italian restaurant.\n\nI’ve become more confident in the kitchen over the years and feel like I more or less know what to expect when I approach a recipe.\n\nEvery now and then, however, a recipe will catch me off guard in a very _very_ good way.\n\nThis Italian sausage butternut squash gnocchi is one of those recipes.\n\nI mean, I didn’t think it was going to be _bad_ by any means.\n\nButternut squash (my fave fall veg), Italian sausage (all things good), and gnocchi (pure comfort food) are all involved.\n\nAdd some butter and a handful of Parmesan cheese, and you have a dinner dream team.\n\nI was not, however, expecting this simple sausage and vegetable gnocchi to blow me away like it did.\n\nI took a bite and had to pause to ask myself if I had really made it.\n\nI suppose we are all allowed to blow ourselves away in the kitchen every now and then, but my goal has always been for _other_ people to feel that way about a recipe.\n\nThis Italian sausage and butternut squash gnocchi made **me** feel that way about myself.\n\nIt was a cool sensation, and I can’t wait for you to try this recipe and experience it too!\n\n![One pan butternut squash gnocchi on a plate](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Italian-Sausage-Butternut-Squash-Gnocchi-1.jpg)\n\n5 Star Review\n-------------\n\n> “Your description is spot on, I tasted this after making it and was blown away! It is so easy, so unique and everyone in the house loved it. This dish is truly gourmet!”\n> \n> — Sarah —\n\nHow to Make Butternut Squash Gnocchi\n------------------------------------\n\nCulinary rock star feelings aside, this is a delicious meal that is so easy to make, it almost feels like cheating.\n\n*   The entire recipe cooks in one skillet, _including_ the gnocchi.\n*   Since it’s packed with both lean protein and veggies, it works as an all-in-one meal, no extra sides required (just like with this [Cauliflower Pasta](https://www.wellplated.com/cauliflower-pasta/) and [Sweet Potato Pasta](https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-potato-pasta/)).\n*   It tastes like fall comfort on a plate and had me convinced for a moment that I was back in Italy.\n\n* * *\n\n### **The Ingredients**\n\n*   **Gnocchi**. Delightful, pillowy-soft potato gnocchi is a true crowd-pleaser. It pairs perfectly with the Italian sausage and butternut squash. Want to try your hand at homemade gnocchi? Try my [Sweet Potato Gnocchi](https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-potato-gnocchi/).\n*   **Italian Turkey Sausage**. For a boost of protein and even more comforting flavor, this recipe also includes Italian sausage. I use chicken or turkey sausage 99% of the time. It’s leaner than pork sausage but still delivers on flavor. Pinky promise, you won’t notice the swap.\n\nTip!\n----\n\n*   **Butternut Squash**. Sweet, flavorful, and nutritious. Butternut squash is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\n*   **Spinach**. For an extra boost of nutrition. Spinach is rich in fiber and vitamins.\n*   **Butter**. Since this recipe obtains its soul-satisfying flavor from only a few ingredients, make sure you use a good-quality butter. It makes a world of difference!\n*   **Sage**. For quintessential fall flavor.\n*   **Nutmeg**. Adds an irressitable warmth and coziness to the dish. Plus, it tastes fantastic with the butternut squash!\n*   **Parmesan**. The perfect finishing touch!\n\n### The Directions\n\n1.  Brown the sausage and remove to a plate.\n2.  Sauté the squash and onion with the garlic, sage, and spices.\n3.  Add the chicken broth and gnocchi. Stir in the sausage and spinach. Top with Parmesan. DIG IN!\n\nDietary Note\n------------\n\n*   **To Make Vegan**. If you need this to be a vegan butternut squash gnocchi recipe, you can swap the butter for vegan butter, vegetable broth for the chicken broth, omit the Italian sausage, and use a vegan Parmesan substitute.\n*   **To Make Gluten Free**. For gluten-free butternut squash gnocchi, select a gluten-free gnocchi option. Note that you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\n![Potato pasta, ground meat, and veggies in a pot](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sausage-Butternut-Squash-Gnocchi-1.jpg)\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   **To Store**. Refrigerate leftover gnocchi in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days. \n*   **To Reheat**. Rewarm gently in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of extra chicken broth or water to keep it from drying out.\n*   **To Freeze**. Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating. \n\nMeal Prep Tip\n-------------\n\nBrown the sausage up to 1 day in advance. Refrigerate it in an airtight storage container.\n\nWhat to Serve with Butternut Squash Gnocchi\n-------------------------------------------\n\n![Italian sausage butternut squash gnocchi in a Dutch oven](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Italian-Sausage-Gnocchi-with-Butternut-Squash-Spinach-1.jpg)\n\n*   **[Dutch Oven](https://amzn.to/2R0QluK)**.

The ideal tool for cutting the butternut squash.\n\nI am so excited for you to try this butternut squash gnocchi recipe! If you do give it a go, please let me know how it turned out in the comments section below.\n\nHearing from you makes my day even more than a second helping of this gnocchi did (and you know how strongly I feel about it by now?).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**What is Gnocchi?**\n\nGnocchi is a soft, pillowy, Italian-style dumpling that’s made from potatoes. It’s typically eaten like pasta with a sauce.\n\nFor this recipe, I recommend using premade, shelf-stable gnocchi, which you can find near the pasta in your grocery store.\n\n**Can I Use a Different Type of Italian Sausage?**\n\nI prefer to use Italian turkey or chicken sausage because they have less fat. However, you can certainly use Italian pork sausage if you prefer.\n\n**Can I Use Pre-Cut Butternut Squash Cubes?**\n\nYes, you can cut a butternut squash yourself or use pre-cut butternut squash cubes. Depending upon the size they are cut, you may need to adjust the saute time accordingly.\n\nemail me the recipe!\n--------------------\n\nEnter your email below to save this recipe to your free Well Plated recipe box.\n\nFrom time to time, we’ll send you the best of Well Plated.

Once the butter is melted, add the sausage. Cook, breaking apart the meat, until it is browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a plate.\n    \n*   Reduce the skillet heat to medium. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Once melted, add the squash and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender and golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic, salt, pepper, rubbed sage (if using fresh sage, wait to add it until the end), and nutmeg. Continue cooking until the garlic is softened and fragrant, about 1 additional minute.\n    \n*   Add 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and gnocchi to the skillet. Increase the heat to medium high. Stir to coat the gnocchi, then cover the pan. Cook, covered, until the gnocchi is just tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover and stir in the sausage. Stir in the spinach a few handfuls at a time, allowing it to wilt. If you’d like a looser sauce, add a bit more chicken broth. Sprinkle with Parmesan and season to taste with additional salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Enjoy hot.\n    \n\n*   **TO STORE**: Refrigerate gnocchi in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days. \n*   **TO REHEAT**: Rewarm gently in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of extra chicken broth or water to keep it from drying out.\n*   **TO FREEZE**: Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months.

This scrumptious Summer salad is fun, fruity, and flavorful, and topped with the most amazing homemade blueberry balsamic dressing._\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070.jpg)\n\nWhile I’m no stranger to [dumping blueberries into my salads](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/08/blueberry-broccoli-spinach-salad.html), I’ve never once considered blending them into a dressing. Well not until a berry dressing finally knocked my socks off, that is. There’s a sweet raspberry dressing at a local lunch spot here that has totally changed my mind about fruity dressings and holy cow I’ve been missing out!\n\nSince I suspect their berry dressing is laced with enough sugar to classify it as liquid candy, I figured I had two choices: embrace dessert salads and give up donuts in favor of sugar-laden greens \\*OR\\* make my own healthy berry salad dressing at home.\n\nObviously I chose the latter.\n\n_No way am I giving up donuts!_\n\nRaspberries don’t last long in this house, as my [pint-sized sidekick](https://peasandcrayons.com/chickpea), can clear out a carton in a sitting, so I decided to tackle the bucket of farm-fresh blueberries we picked the week prior.\n\nI blended a cup of berries into my go-to [balsamic dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2017/03/strawberry-steak-salad-with-homemade-balsamic-dressing.html) and had to talk myself down from polishing off the entire jar right then and there. I really am kicking myself for not jumping on the fruity dressing bandwagon when it first became a thing. It’s totally legit!\n\nBring on the berries!\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad topped with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peas-and-crayons-2.jpg)\n\n:: vegetarian :: gluten-free :: dairy-free :: paleo :: clean eating ::\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Spring Mix Salad with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 1 heaping cup blueberries\n*   ▢ 1 4-5 oz bag spring mix salad greens\n*   ▢ ½ English cucumber, chopped\n*   ▢ ½ cup mandarin orange segments\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [dried cranberries](https://amzn.to/2xfMnEi)\n*   ▢ 2-4 TBSP roasted unsalted sunflower seeds\n\n#### BLUEBERRY BALSAMIC DRESSING:\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup blueberries\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup [balsamic vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qdt4WJ)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP [red wine vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qgx73B)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 1 TBSP  honey\n*   ▢ 1 tsp salt I use sea salt\n*   ▢ ⅛ tsp black pepper\n*   ▢ ½ cup [avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2fyn7A) olive oil works too\n\n*   First make your dressing: In a [food processor](http://amzn.to/2re4Boz) or [blender](http://amzn.to/2rdX09u), combine all dressing ingredients except for the avocado oil. Blend until blueberries are completely pureed, then use the little top cut-out to drizzle in the avocado oil at the end. Once dressing is emulsified you're good to go!\n    \n*   Wash + dry your greens. \n    \n*   Combine with cucumber and blueberries, then toss with a drizzle or two of dressing. Add extra as desired.\n    \n*   Top with mandarin orange segments, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds and serve!\n    \n\nMaking this salad in advance? Go for it! Mix together everything minus the orange and dressing then combine when ready to serve!\n\nNOTE: This recipe makes a bottle's worth of dressing which will keep great in the fridge for future salads. Only want a little? Feel free to halve the recipe!\n\nRecipe yields 2 large salads or 4 side salads.\n\n_Nutrition Facts below are estimated using an online recipe nutrition calculator.

It's also the star in my [Mango Black Bean Quinoa Salad](https://greensnchocolate.com/mango-black-bean-quinoa-salad/).\n\n**Onion** - white or yellow onion both work in this recipe.\n\n**Garlic** - fresh garlic adds delicious flavor.\n\n**Fresh Sage** - I love adding fresh sage to fall dishes for an earthy flavor. I also love it in my [Garlic Herb Mayonnaise Roasted Turkey](https://greensnchocolate.com/garlic-herb-mayonnaise-roasted-turkey/) recipe!\n\n**Maple Syrup** - this is part of the very light sauce that adds some sweetness and warm flavor to the dish. It's not only used in sweet dishes like [Maple Muffins](https://greensnchocolate.com/maple-donut-muffins/)!\n\n**Dried Cherries** - cherries add a hint of sweetness and tartness. I love the texture they add, too.\n\n**Goat Cheese** - crumbles of creamy goat cheese make every bite a mouthful of flavor!\n\nSee recipe card for complete list of ingredients and quantities.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nThis recipe is absolutely delicious as is, but here are some variations.\n\n**Different greens** - If you prefer spinach, chard, or another type of green, you can easily swap out the kale.\n\n**Different squash** - You could use diced acorn squash, diced delicata squash, or diced sweet potato instead of butternut squash.\n\n**Different grain** - if you aren't a fan of quinoa or have something else on hand, feel free to swap it. Other ideas include wheat berries, brown rice, couscous, barley, and farro.\n\n**Different cheese** \\- you could use Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, or blue cheese instead of goat cheese.\n\n**Swap the fruit.** Instead of dried cherries, you can use dried cranberries or pomegranate arils. I think diced apples would also be delicious!\n\nRecipe Step by Step Instructions\n--------------------------------\n\n![](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blank-1200-x-600-52.png.webp)\n\n1.

A satisfying, veggie-filled and tasty breakfast.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-7-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### You may be wondering, what is a hash anyway?\n\nA hash is a dish of diced, ground or chopped meat and often times vegetables sautéed in a frying pan. We think it’s the perfect way to start the day when you’re in search of something savory, warm, satisfying, and hearty. Thanks to the well-balanced nature of this dish, it will keep your blood sugars stable all morning long, leaving you satisfied and ready to tackle the day.\n\nMaking a hash is also the perfect opportunity to ‘clean out the fridge’ and use up what you have on hand. But if you’re looking for more guidance we have some additional hash recipes for you to try including [Sweet Potato Hash with Bacon](https://therealfooddietitians.com/sweet-potato-hash-recipe/), [Tex Mex Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/tex-mex-sweet-potato-hash/), [Chicken Apple Sausage Sweet Potato Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/chicken-apple-sausage-sweet-potato-hash/), and [Brussels Sprouts Sweet Potato Sausage Hash](https://therealfooddietitians.com/brussels-sprouts-sweet-potato-sausage-hash/).\n\n#### Serve as an egg-free breakfast or if you wish, top with a fried egg.\n\nImagine your breakfast plate filled with tender butternut squash cubes, sweet apples and savory homemade sausage. While this Butternut Squash and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a satisfyingly scrumptious egg-free breakfast, a fried egg or two makes a nice addition for extra protein and staying power. Whatever you choose, we know you’re going to love this recipe! \n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-5-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Meal prep-friendly.\n\n[**Butternut Squash**](https://therealfooddietitians.com/butternut-squash-noodles-with-sausage-and-kale/) and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a great recipe for your weekend meal prep. It’s quick to make and reheats ever so nicely. Preparing this dish ahead of time, either from start to finish or simply pre-chopping your vegetables and cooking the sausage means you’ll spend less time in the kitchen during the busy work week.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-6-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Making your own sausage comes with benefits.\n\nUsing ground turkey (or chicken or pork) and a few dried spices from the pantry in place of store-bought breakfast sausage saves you money and means you’ll be getting less sodium and no preservatives. You know exactly what goes into the sausage when you make your own. The sausage is freezer-friendly so if you wish, you could double or triple the sausage portion of the recipe so that you can stock your freezer with some for future meals and recipes.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-8-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Not a kale lover? No problem.\n\nReplace the kale with spinach or chard or leave it out. It’s still incredibly delicious.\n\nGive this Butternut Squash and Apple Hash with Sausage a try! It makes for a much better option as compared to those high-sugar breakfasts we might be familiar with. Better yet, add it to this weekends meal prep so that you’ll have a healthy breakfast, lunch or dinner ready for reheating and eating. \n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1½ Tbsp.

You’ve just invited friends and family to a cookout at your place next weekend, but now you’ve found yourself at a bit of a loss for what to feed them! Hamburgers and hotdogs? Been there, done that. The routine BBQ Chicken that always seems to get scorched on the outside while it’s undercooked on the inside. Umm…maybe not.\n\nHow about adding a surprising gourmet touch that will make you famous for your skills at the grill, but it’s so simple you won’t even break a sweat? Sound good? If so, our Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers are the perfect option!\n\nThese skewers are everything you’re looking for in a backyard-friendly grilling dish. Our recipe offers a blend of enticing flavors, clean eating ingredients, and an unexpected taste that will have your guests asking, “What’s in this?” Well, the answer is healthy flavor– and _a lot of it._ \n\n**What Ingredients Do I Need?**\n-------------------------------\n\n![These flavorful chipotle honey chicken skewers will be the star of your cookout!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-6-e1629296144774.jpg)\n\nFirst, you’ll need some chicken! We suggest using boneless, skinless chicken breasts for their low fat and high protein content. Then, whisk together some honey for natural sweetness, tomato paste and apple cider vinegar for a tangy bite, chipotle chili powder for some heat, and garlic for a rich, savory finish. Each ingredient is healthy, and when combined in a sauce, the flavors complement one another perfectly. Oh, and did we mention it’s EASY?\n\n**Making These Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![Grill up some chicken skewers instead of plain old hamburgers and hotdogs. ](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-5-e1629296192708.jpg)\n\nThe preparation process for these honey chipotle chicken skewers is incredibly simple. So simple, in fact, that they can be on the table in less than 30 minutes! Start by slicing your chicken breasts into very thin strips using your sharpest knife. Once all of the slices are ready, begin threading them, accordion-style, onto the wooden skewers that you’ve soaked in some water beforehand (so they don’t burn through). This recipe is for eight skewers, so you should aim to get about four ounces of uncooked chicken onto each one.\n\n[![](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Skinny-Ms-Graphics-Horizontal-728-x-450-px-2.png)](https://bundles.skinnyms.com/?utm_source=skinnyms&utm_medium=inpostbanner)\n\nSet your skewered chicken to the side while you make the chipotle honey sauce. Grab a small bowl and whisk together the honey, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, chipotle chili powder, chopped garlic, and optional salt. Spoon the sauce evenly over the skewers. Alternatively, you can make the sauce in advance and marinate your sliced chicken in it for 30 minutes or longer before threading the strips on your skewers. Either way, make sure to save some of the sauce for basting during the grilling process.\n\nYour uncooked chicken skewers can rest in the fridge (covered with plastic or foil) while you’re preparing your side dishes. That way, you can throw them on the grill right before dinner time so they’re fresh and hot off the grill! When you’re ready, add the skewers to a hot grill for 10 to 12 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. Throughout the grilling process, baste the chicken with sauce, turning the skewers every 2 to 3 minutes. This will ensure the chicken is evenly cooked.\n\nIf the rain clouds come out and you’re forced to move inside, away from the grill, you’ll be glad to know that this recipe can also be prepared in the oven. Preheat it to 400 degrees. Cook them for 16-18 minutes or until fully cooked, rotating and basting every 5 or 6 minutes. If you like a little crisp on your sauced chicken, turn the broiler on and broil them for a minute or two once they are cooked, but be careful not to burn!\n\n**What Side Dishes Go With These Chicken Skewers?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Our quick and easy southwest cucumber avocado salad is a must-make this Summer!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Quick-and-Easy-Southwest-Cucumber-Avocado-Salad-8-e1606794206790.jpg)](https://skinnyms.com/quick-and-easy-southwest-cucumber-avocado-salad/)\n\nOur honey chipotle chicken skewers will no doubt be the star of the dinner plate, but every star needs a supporting actor (or two!).

A Thanksgiving dinner (or really any dinner) side dish winner!\n\n![A bowl of sautéed maple bacon Brussels sprouts on a marble table.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-1.jpg)\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Ingredients](#ingredients)\n*   [How to Cut Brussels Sprouts](#how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts)\n*   [How to Make Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts](#how-to-make-maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts)\n*   [Chef’s Tips](#chefs-tips)\n*   [What’s the Easiest Way to Cut Bacon?](#whats-the-easiest-way-to-cut-bacon)\n*   [Can I Make This Recipe in Advance?](#can-i-make-this-recipe-in-advance)\n*   [Recipe](#recipe)\n\nBacon and brussels sprouts and maple syrup and bourbon, oh my!\n\nThese are most definitely a few of my favorite things. And if you’re reading this post, they’re probably some of yours too, which means we can totally be friends. A friend who shares her bacon is a friend for life. BFFs = Bacon. Friends. _Forevah_.\n\nBrussels sprouts are sort of a culinary line in the sand, right? If you love them, you really _really_ love ’em. You love crispy [Brussels sprouts in the air fryer](https://oursaltykitchen.com/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts/) and [shredded Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/shredded-brussels-sprouts/) in the oven. You love them raw in a salad, and you definitely wouldn’t turn your nose up at [Christmas Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/pan-roasted-brussels-sprouts-cranberries-pistachios/) with pistachios and cranberries.\n\nAnd if you don’t? Well, **you just might need bacon and bourbon to make ’em palatable**. And you’re in luck!\n\nMaple bacon Brussels sprouts are both sweet and savory; crunchy and tender; and oh so very pretty to look at. The best part? This recipe is really easy to make – even for beginners!\n\n![The ingredients for maple bacon Brussels sprouts arranged on a marble table - brussels sprouts, diced bacon, chopped pecans, bourbon, mustard powder, and maple syrup.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-4.jpeg)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   **Brussels Sprouts:** choose the freshest sprouts you can find. In their peak season, you can often find Brussels sprouts still attached to the stalk. Those are great! But they’re not essential. For the freshest Brussels sprouts, look for bright green sprouts with firmly packed leaves that aren’t yellow or withering. Avoid sprouts that are cracked or have too many black spots.\n*   **Bacon:** both regular and thick cut bacon work.\n*   **Pecans:** use raw, unsalted pecans. Coarsely chop them, or buy “pecan pieces”. If you don’t like pecans, walnuts are a nice substitute.\n*   **Ground (Dry) Mustard:** dry mustard is just ground up mustard seeds. On its own, it’s essentially flavorless, but once it’s “activated” by a liquid (in this recipe, bourbon) it bring a pleasant pungency and a bit of acidity to the dish.\n*   **Bourbon:** bourbon is used to deglaze the pan, and lends a smoky flavor. But more importantly, bourbon is slightly acidic! This is important, as the acidity will neutralize the sulfuric odors released during the cooking process (those orders, and resulting flavor, are why some find Brussels sprouts so off-putting. Neutralize it for clean, rich flavor!).\n*   **Maple Syrup:** our sweet foil! Opposites attract, and here we have a few. Maple syrup will balance out the saltiness in the bacon, the pungency of the mustard, and the acidity of the bourbon. It’s a must, so don’t skip!\n\n**BOURBON SUBSTITUTION:** If you don’t consume alcohol, or don’t want to use bourbon, replace it with two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.\n\nHow to Cut Brussels Sprouts\n---------------------------\n\nBefore you even get started, be sure to use sprouts that are (roughly) the same size – this way they’ll cook evenly, at the same rate! The only thing worse than a mushy sprout is an undercooked sprout, and uniformity from the start will make the job that much easier. \n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the ends trimmed.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-1.jpg)\n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the outer leaves peeled off.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n![Side view, trimmed and peeled Brussels sprouts sliced in half on a cutting board.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-3.jpg)\n\n1.  Use sharp paring knife to **trim off the root end** of each sprout.\n2.  **Peel away any withered or yellowed leaves.** If your Brussels sprouts are very fresh you should only need to remove the outer layer.\n3.  **Slice each sprout in half lengthwise**, from top to bottom. This cut allows the densely packed leaves to cook through all the way to the center.\n\nHow to Make Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts\n----------------------------------------\n\nWith maple syrup, bacon, and pecans, this Brussels sprouts recipe has a little something for everyone. Start by blanching the Brussels sprouts in salted water, then finish them on the stove – this method creates tender interiors and crisp edges. The bourbon is optional, but recommended. You can substitute for apple cider vinegar if you don’t cook with alcohol.\n\n![Side view, bacon Brussels sprouts tossed with maple syrup and pecans in a white bowl with a wood spoon.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n1.  **Blanch the Brussels sprouts** in salted water. Cook 4-5 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender but still bright green. They’re ready once you can easily piece the stem using the tip of a knife.\n2.  **Strain the sprouts**, then run them under **cool running water or plunge into an ice bath** to stop the cooking process. Shake well, **then air dry** on a kitchen towel to remove any clinging water droplets.\n3.  **Cook the bacon in a 12″ skillet** over medium heat until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, then **remove the bacon pieces** using a slotted spoon.\n4.  Increase the heat to medium high and **add the Brussels sprouts and pecans** to the rendered bacon fat; **saute** until the edges of the sprouts are crisp, about 5 minutes.\n5.  **Sprinkle the ground mustard** over the sprouts and pecans and cook 1-2 minutes more.\n6.  **Deglaze the pan with the bourbon**, stirring constantly until its completely absorbed.\n7.  **Pour in the maple syrup** and cook 1 minute more, or until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve right away. Enjoy!\n\nChef’s Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Use **real maple syrup**, not pancake syrup, for pure maple flavor.\n*   **Swap pecans for walnuts**, or simply omit them.\n*   **Don’t overcook the Brussels sprouts when blanching!** Drain them when they’re still bright green, after 4-5 minutes.\n*   Season the water with **plenty of kosher salt** – about a tablespoon; it will infuse the Brussels sprouts with flavor from the inside out.\n*   Use a **large, 12″ skillet.** This allows the Brussels sprouts to make lots of contact with the surface for crispier edges.\n*   **Wait to season with salt and pepper** until the end – you may need just a pinch of salt, or none at all.\n\nWhat’s the Easiest Way to Cut Bacon?\n------------------------------------\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to slice bacon with a chef’s knife, it’s sort of a cumbersome process. Use kitchen shears instead! It makes for quick, efficient work.\n\nCan I Make This Recipe in Advance?\n----------------------------------\n\nYes, maple bacon Brussels sprouts are partially make ahead friendly!\n\nBlanch the Brussels sprouts, then plunge them into an ice bath. Drain, then store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Cook in the skillet as directed 15-20 minutes before you’re ready to serve.\n\n![A bowl of maple bacon Brussels sprouts on a marble table with a wood spoon and cream linen napkin to the side.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-3.jpeg)\n\n**Did you make these Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts?

Bring the water to a boil and season with the kosher salt. Add the brussels sprouts to the boil water and give them a good stir. Boil 4-5 minutes, until the sprouts are tender but still bright green in color. Drain in a colander, run under cold water to stop the cooking process, then lay on a kitchen towel to dry.\n    \n*   Place the bacon in a 12\" skillet and heat over medium heat. Saute, stirring occassionally, until the fat renders and bacon is crisp, 7-8 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and place onto a paper-towel lined plate to drain.\n    \n*   Increase the heat to medium high, then add the blanched Brussels sprouts and pecans to the rendered bacon fat. Saute over high heat, stirring frequently, until the sprouts are crisp, 4-5 minutes.\n    \n*   Sprinkle the mustard powder over the sprouts and pecans, then stir constantly for 1 minute. Pour the bourbon (or cider vinegar) into the pan to deglaze; stir and scrape constantly until any browned bits have been scraped up and the bourbon is completely absorbed, 2-3 minutes.\n    \n*   Add the bacon back to the pan, then pour in the maple syrup. Give everything a good toss, then cook 1 minute more, until the syrup is slightly thickened. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper if needed. Serve right away, and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Make Ahead Instructions**\n\nAfter you’ve blanched the Brussels sprouts, drain them well, then spread onto a paper towel or kitchen towel to thoroughly dry. Place them into a sealed container or ziplock bag and place into the fridge, where they’ll keep for about 24 hours. When you’re ready to serve, start with Step 2. The blanched Brussels sprouts can go straight from the fridge to the pan.\n\nServing: 4oz, Calories: 175kcal (9%), Carbohydrates: 18g (6%), Protein: 6g (12%), Fat: 8g (12%), Saturated Fat: 1g (5%), Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g, Monounsaturated Fat: 1g, Trans Fat: 0g, Cholesterol: 5mg (2%), Sodium: 318mg (13%), Potassium: 389mg (11%), Fiber: 3g (12%), Sugar: 2g (2%), Vitamin A: 18% (18%), Vitamin C: 117% (117%), Calcium: 7% (7%), Iron: 8% (8%)\n\n_**Disclaimer:** This post and the recipe card may contain affiliate links, which means we receive a small commission (at no cost to you!) if you make a purchase using these links.

Potato ‘french’ fries are a staple pretty much everywhere, and with good reason, with that crispy outside and silky smooth inside, they are simply irresistible! Sweet potato fries are becoming more popular these days and carrot fries are just as good! Carrots are pretty easy to turn into fries, you just need to get some large ones, peel them and slice them into sticks before frying them! Of course you can deep fry them, and they are amazing deep fried, but you can also roast them, which keeps them a little lighter. When I roast carrot fries I like to season them with salt and pepper and hit of parmesan cheese adds a huge amount of flavour! In addition to just tasting amazing, the parmesan also melts onto the carrot fries and caramelizes getting all nice and crispy and good making the fries even crispier! Carrots are sweet so I like to serve them with a spicy dipping sauce like chipotle mayo or a gochujang ketchup and they are the perfect side for pretty much any meal, especially an Easter dinner!\n\n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004604-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004614-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004566-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004592-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")  \n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004603-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")\n\n![Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries](https://www.closetcooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ParmesanRoastedCarrotFrieswithChipotleMayo8004575-min.jpg \"Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\")\n\n#### Parmesan Roasted Carrot Fries\n\n**Prep Time**: 10 minutes **Cook Time**: 20 minutes **Total Time**: 30 minutes **Servings**: 6\n\nSweet roasted carrot fries covered with crispy parmesan cheese!\n\n##### ingredients\n\n*   2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4 in thick ‘fries’\n*   1 tablespoon oil\n*   salt and pepper to taste\n*   1/2 cup parmigiano reggiano (parmesan cheese), grated\n\n##### directions\n\n1.

But, if you’re a fan of a creamy pasta salad, or an ultra easy-to-make pasta salad that’s loaded with healthier goodness (plus bacon!), this avocado and bacon pasta salad is for you.\n\nOnce the garden tomatoes come into harvest, BLT sandwiches are a staple at our house. And the only thing that makes them even better is adding avocado for them to become BLATs. Bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato sandwiches that are now a BBQ pasta salad staple.\n\nSo when my daughter requested I make a pasta salad that included her beloved bacon in the BLT mix, avocado was an obvious addition to make.\n\n[![BLT pasta salad ingredients in glass bowl](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1.jpg)\n\nBLT Pasta Salad Ingredients\n---------------------------\n\nI’m sure you can already guess the key ingredients in this BLT pasta salad recipe, but I added in a few more veggies to add extra pops of flavor. Instead of lettuce, I used peppery arugula, which pairs beautifully with the ranch pasta salad dressing. And I prefer using cherry tomatoes in this BLT pasta salad because they’re so juicy and hold their shape nicely.\n\nThe other ingredients you’ll need for this potluck side dish are:\n\n*   Pasta\n*   Bacon\n*   Cherry tomatoes\n*   Arugula\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Greek yogurt\n*   Mayonnaise\n*   White vinegar\n*   Chives\n*   Parsley\n*   Garlic powder\n*   Salt and pepper\n\nThe pasta salad dressing is a little healthier, because I used Greek yogurt instead of full flavored mayonnaise and sour cream. But thanks to the fresh herbs it has a totally fresh and delicious flavor.\n\nAs with any cold pasta salad, taste the dressing after you’ve whisked it together to see if it needs more salt or pepper. It’s much easier to season the dressing before it’s been tossed with the pasta!\n\n[![container of greek yogurt next to sliced red onion on counter](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002.jpg)\n\nHow to Make BLT Pasta Salad\n---------------------------\n\nTo make this homemade pasta salad, you’ll first need to cook the pasta noodles according to the package’s instructions. I tend to undercook my pasta just a bit for pasta salads so it doesn’t turn to mush as it absorbs the salad dressing.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, dice the bacon and cook it until it reaches your desired level of crispness. Note that you won’t have to oil the pan before cooking the bacon in it as the bacon will release a good amount of fat as it cooks.\n\nOnce the pasta has cooled slightly and the bacon and veggies have been prepped, add everything to a large bowl and toss to combine.\n\nNext up is the dressing. This pasta salad dressing is so easy to make, and is an easier rendition of [my homemade Ranch dressing](https://www.foodiecrush.com/homemade-ranch-dressing-recipe/) for saucing this easy pasta salad. In a separate bowl, whisk together the homemade ranch dressing. Pour the dressing over the BLT pasta salad and gently stir to distribute it.\n\n[![Homemade Ranch Dressing Recipe | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)\n\nCan I Use Fat-Free Greek Yogurt?\n--------------------------------\n\nPersonally, I would steer clear of using fat-free yogurt in this homemade pasta salad. Fat-free yogurts are often loaded with additives to make up for their flavor, and have a tendency to separate. Stick to low-fat or whole milk plain Greek yogurt for this recipe.\n\nThe Best Pastas for Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nI like this pasta salad best with a short pasta noodle, and like in my [Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/)  I use my favorite shell noodle. But, there are quite a few other types you can try, like:\n\n*   Farfalle (bowtie or butterflies)\n*   Gemelli (twists)\n*   Fusilli (springs)\n*   Campanelle (flowers)\n*   Penne (tubes)\n*   Orichette (ears)\n\nAlways cook your pasta in water that’s been generously salted. I always prefer kosher salt to regular table or iodized salt because it’s not as harsh due to its larger, flakier crystals.\n\n[![BLT Pasta Salad with Avocado | foodiecrush.com #pasta #salad #BLT #bacon #tomato #avocado #recipes](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013.jpg)\n\nCan I Prep This Pasta Salad in Advance?\n---------------------------------------\n\nI actually prefer my pasta salads to be served chilled, so yes, you can definitely prep this bacon pasta salad in advance. Just note that the longer the bacon sits in the dressing, the less crisp it will be when you serve this pasta salad.\n\nWith that said, this BLT pasta salad will be fine if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to serving it. This will give the flavors time to come together.\n\nCan I Double This BLT Pasta Salad Recipe?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re making this pasta salad for a backyard BBQ or potluck party, you can easily double the recipe if you’ll be feeding a _lot_ of people. One pound of pasta makes a lot of pasta salad, and the salad as-is serves 12 or more, but will stretch further if you’re serving other salads or side dishes along with it.\n\n[![close up of avocado and bacon pasta salad](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009.jpg)\n\nTips for Making BLT Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you’re out of ingredients or out of time to make the easy homemade dressing, feel free to use a quality bottled ranch dressing instead.\n\nWe prefer using classic pork bacon to make this BLT pasta salad, but you’re welcome to use any type of bacon you’d like.\n\nOne final note: the sliced avocado will brown as it sits in this BLT pasta salad. Personally, I don’t mind eating brown avocado (it’s perfectly safe to eat!), but if that’s something you’re worried about you can wait to stir it in until just before you serve this homemade pasta salad.\n\nMore Pasta Salad Ideas to Try\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Classic Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/) (this one always gets raves)\n*   [Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto](https://www.foodiecrush.com/craving-5-recipes-for-creamy-macaroni-salad/ \"Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto\")\n*   [Easy Italian Spaghetti Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/easy-italian-spaghetti-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Creamy Tuscan Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/tuscan-pasta-salad/)\n*   [How to Make Classic Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-classic-macaroni-salad/) (because classics always win!)\n*   [Kale Caesar Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/kale-caesar-pasta-salad/ \"Kale Caesar Pasta Salad\")\n*   [Greek Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/greek-pasta-salad-cucumbers-artichoke-hearts/)\n\n**If you mak****e this recipe, please let me know!

    "markdown": "# Spicy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls - Jessica Gavin\n_For a satisfying meal try these healthy chicken tomatillo quinoa bowls loaded with wholesome ingredients! Tender chicken is tossed in a spicy and creamy roasted tomatillo sauce for a flavor kick!_\n\n![Healthy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wholesome-chicken-tomatillo-and-quinoa-black-bean-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhen you go to your favorite Mexican restaurant are you a red sauce or green sauce fan? I used to be all about the earthy creamy red sauce poured on top of burritos, enchiladas or stewed meat. Then one day I had a change of heart when I had the most incredible plate of pork Chile Verde. I’ve been itching to learn how to make tomatillo sauce that could I use for just about any meal.\n\nToday I’m sharing a healthy chicken tomatillo bowl! You will learn how to make the sauce from scratch paired with a creamy, and spicy chicken topped on a bed of [cooked quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/). I will leave the rest of the extra toppings up to you, but at least you’ll have the essential recipe.\n\n![a sheet pan filled with green tomatillos](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fresh-tomatillos-onions-pasilla-chilis-garlic-for-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhat are Tomatillos?\n--------------------\n\nYou may have seen them hanging out next to the hot peppers in the produce aisle, but have you dared to cook with them? To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first, but I gave it a shot. Here are the basics of using tomatillos in cooking.\n\n*   Tomatillos are a member of the nightshade family. They are wrapped in a wrinkly paper husk, and once you remove the outer layer a gorgeous candy-apple green colored fruit appears. You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.\n*   Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.\n*   To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.\n\n![making green salsa with peppers and onions](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/oven-roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nThe base for the tomatillo sauce is, of course, the green fruit to add it’s characteristic tangy flavor, jalapeno, and pasilla (or poblano) peppers for heat, caramelized purple onions for sweetness and buttery roasted garlic for earthiness.\n\nCheck out how all of the fruit, vegetables, and aromatics just melt together in the pan after roasting. So many incredible flavors in one place, divine!\n\n![side by side before and after photos of sauce ingredients from solid to puree](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-before-and-after-blending-600x450.jpg)\n\nNow it’s time to bring the sauce components together! Chicken broth and fresh parsley are added to the roasted ingredients, then pureed in my Vitamix Blender until smooth.\n\nSo the first taste I took off the tomatillo salsa, it was SPICY! If you want more of a mild sauce, remove the seeds and inner membranes of the jalapenos and pasilla peppers before roasting. Or even add just one jalapeno instead of two. However once I added some yogurt to the sauce, that helped bring down the heat. This recipe makes a lot of sauce so that you can use it for another meal like [enchiladas](https://www.jessicagavin.com/chicken-enchiladas-with-pumpkin-sauce/), or even as a salsa with some crunchy chips!\n\n![chicken breasts being seared in a pan](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/spiced-sauteed-chicken-breast-600x900.jpg)\n\nLet’s talk POLLO. For the shredded chicken, I like to add a generous amount of spices for flavor, and a short [saute](https://www.jessicagavin.com/sauteing/) so that the chicken stays nice and juicy. You can bake, or poach the chicken, but I like the flavors developed on the surface from the sear with the sauteed chicken. If you are in a pinch for time, grab a roasted chicken from the store and shred away.\n\n![spoon mixing green sauce with shredded chicken](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/creamy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-1-600x900.jpg)\n\nOh yea, check out this creamy green goodness! The spicy tomatillo sauce gets combined with just a touch of plain Greek yogurt to add a creamy texture to each bite. The yogurt also helps to back the heat a bit, but it’s still got a nice kick! The sauce and the chicken get tossed together, and it’s ready for bowl customization.\n\n![top down view of two bowls of chicken tomatillo served on top of quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healthy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-bowls-with-quinoa-600x900.jpg)\n\nIt’s topping time! I like a balance of textures and making sure I get a variety of colors for extra nutritional benefits. I add sliced radishes, limes, chopped red onions, black beans, diced avocado and tomatoes to the bowl. The additional protein, fiber, and phytonutrients make this a healthy meal that you will crave!\n\n![close of up a chicken quinoa bowl](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-tomatillo-chicken-and-quinoa-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nGrab a fork and let’s dig in! If you are having guests over you can create a build-your-own chicken bowl bar and put out different toppings and even have brown rice or vegetable noodles to fill. What other tasty dishes would you add the tomatillo sauce? I would love to hear so I can try!\n\nHow do you pick ripe tomatillos?\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen tomatillos are ripe, they are juicy, firm and tart. A few guidelines when you are at the market to pick ripe tomatillos are go for smaller sizes. They tend to be a little sweeter. Slightly peel back the husk and look for bright green colored fruit. This will yield a more tangy fruit which is what you want in your dish. Pale yellow or light green tomatillo will be overripe but less tart. Touch the outside of the husk and look for it to be sticky and not dry and the fruit should fill most of the husk. Pick firm tomatillos, if it’s too soft, it’s past it’s prime.\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   ▢ 20 tomatillos\n*   ▢ 2 jalapeño peppers, stems removed\n*   ▢ 3 pasilla chilies, or poblanos, stems removed\n*   ▢ ½ red onion, cut in half\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole\n*   ▢ 1 cup unsalted chicken broth, or stock\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, packed\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons nonfat plain Greek yogurt, or lowfat sour cream\n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup quinoa\n*   ▢ 2 cups water\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to ¾-inch thick\n*   ▢ black pepper\n*   ▢ [paprika](https://www.jessicagavin.com/what-is-paprika/)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 425°F. Remove the paper off of the tomatillos and place them on a large baking pan. Add jalapeño peppers, pasilla chilies and cut red onion to the same pan.\n    \n*   Drizzle the chilies with one tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n    \n*   Place the peeled garlic in foil, lightly drizzle with oil and wrap into a packet that is open from the top, place on the corner of the baking pan. Roast chilies, onion, and garlic for 40 minutes stirring chilies after 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa and chicken.\n    \n*   Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.\n    \n*   Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.\n    \n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   Add 1 cup quinoa to a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse well with running water. Transfer to a pot with lid. Add 2 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt.\n    \n*   Bring to a boil, put a lid on then reduce to a simmer, over medium-low heat. Allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until water is absorbed, then turn off the heat. Allow it to sit with the lid on for at least 5 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork when ready to serve.\n    \n*   Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side, or until chicken is no longer pink. Transfer to a clean plate.\n    \n*   Once slightly cooled shred chicken into smaller pieces. Transfer to the saute pan that has 2 cups of tomatillo sauce. Turn heat to medium and warm chicken and sauce until hot. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons yogurt. Taste season with more salt and pepper as desired.\n    \n*   Assemble bowls with quinoa, add tomatillo chicken and other desired toppings.\n    \n\n*   **Additional Topping Suggestions**: Sliced limes, radishes, cilantro, diced onion, tomatoes, black beans, sour cream, and avocado.\n\nCalories 320kcal (16%)Carbohydrates 29g (10%)Protein 27g (54%)Fat 12g (18%)Saturated Fat 2g (10%)Polyunsaturated Fat 2gMonounsaturated Fat 7gCholesterol 71mg (24%)Sodium 1122mg (47%)Potassium 542mg (15%)Fiber 4g (16%)Sugar 5g (6%)Vitamin A 250IU (5%)Vitamin C 37.1mg (45%)Calcium 30mg (3%)Iron 3.4mg (19%)\n\nPercent Daily Values are based on a 2000-calorie diet.

And with strawberry season here and gone so quickly, we must take advantage!\n\nHere in the Midwest, summertime is a constant reminder to truly take things in. To enjoy the days as they are. To accept both the hot (often humid here) weather and the thunderstorms. To take advantage of the long days and spend more time with one another. To get outside and enjoy nature and the blue skies before it gets cold and gray again.\n\nEven though the days are longer, these months do not last long, and I’m finding that summer teaches us to be more present. To appreciate what we have when we have it. It is all about perspective.

Here, I’ve included the method used by restaurants to get that ideal, slightly dried-out rice without having to wait a day. The YouTube channel [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChineseCookingDemystified/) is one of my favorite places to go for all my Chinese culinary questions. The method that its hosts Steph and Chris use to par-boil then steam the rice is borderline miraculous in the results you get. The Delish kitchen team was floored at the consistent texture you get with the rice, and I for one will not be cooking my rice any other way going forward.  \n• **Oil:** Choose an oil with a high-smoke point, and don’t be afraid to use a lot of oil—this is fried rice after all.  \n• **Eggs**: I use 3 large eggs in this recipe. I prefer to have some white streaks in my eggs, so I barely beat them together.  \n• **Garlic:** I like my fried rice super garlicky, so I use 5 cloves. You can take it back if you want, but honestly, I don’t suggest it—the more garlic, the better.  \n• **Ginger:** About an inch of ginger, minced very small, goes with the garlic before adding in our veggies.  \n• **Scallions:** When chopping your scallions, separate the whites and the greens. The green we’ll use as a garnish, and the white we’ll cook with.  \n• **Soy Sauce:** The first thing you’ll notice about this recipe is that soy sauce is included. While to some, this might not be super-traditional in fried rice, a lot of American eaters (and Delish taste testers) prefer it! Because there is no meat or seafood in this fried rice, after some testing, I felt it added some extra body and umami to the rice that is totally delicious. I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce so you can control the salt amount.  \n• **Sugar:** I believe that all savory dishes should be finished off with a bit of sugar if there isn’t a natural source of sweetness in it. It helps to round out the dish and provide a more complex flavor.  \n• **White Pepper:** White pepper is underutilized outside of fancier kitchens, but it’s worth buying if you can. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite things about this recipe; at home, I’ll add even more. It’s earthy, and has less of a kick than black pepper.  \n• **MSG:** MSG adds the perfect sweet-salty boost to fried rice. It’s a widely misunderstood ingredient—checkout this article all about [MSG](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35119070/msg-monosodium-glutamate/) if you’re looking to learn more.  \n• **Peas:** I personally love peas in fried rice, and find it’s a common addition in many American versions. Don’t worry about using frozen peas, they won’t emit too much moisture to the rice.  \n• **Butter:** Using butter is a bit controversial, but it adds a wonderful richness, and a little bit goes a long way. If you really don’t want to use it, you can omit it.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nLeftover rice works perfectly for fried rice, so if you have some hanging out in your fridge, use it here. But, if you don’t have any, never fear: I’ve found a 2-step technique to make freshly cooked rice absolutely perfect for fried rice. The first step of making any rice dish is to adequately clean your rice. Some people like to do this in the pot they’re going to cook their rice in, but I like to use a mesh strainer. Rinse the rice—moving around the grains frequently—until the water comes out clean.\n\nOnce your rice is ready, you’re going to par-boil the rice for just a few minutes. This will help to jumpstart the cooking process, breaking down the outsides of the grains of rice.\n\nOnce you strain the rice, we’re ready to make an impromptu steamer with a pot and a strainer that fits inside of it. First, add some water to the bottom of the pot, then put the strainer filled with your rinsed rice in it. Next, you’re going to want to create some holes in the rice with chopsticks to allow steam to circulate.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9983579638752053xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter making your holes, cover the pot with tin foil; it doesn’t have to be totally snug, but it should be well-tented. Then, cover with the pot lid and let it steam. Steaming the rice is a gentler cooking process that keeps the grains pretty dry and adds less moisture to the rice, which is what we’re looking for.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, check on your rice: It should almost taste al-dente. What I mean by this is that it should be fully cooked through, but should taste drier than normal steamed rice. Once it’s ready, I like to spread my rice on a sheet pan. This is a bit of overkill, but it will help your rice to cool down more quickly (which means fried rice faster!).\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNow that our rice is ready, let’s focus on bringing everything together. A wok is the most traditional way to cook fried rice, and it does work especially well. The movement and centralized heat are very helpful, and its size holds a large amount of rice . But if you don’t have one, don’t let that stop you: I’ve made incredible fried rice in a cast iron skillet.\n\nBarely beat the eggs together (if you prefer some whites in your egg) before adding to your wok. Once you add to the wok, move your eggs around quickly, pressing in with a spatula to make those perfect fried rice egg squiggles. Once they’re ready, take them out, and give your wok a quick wipe down. I recommend pre-cooking your eggs because if they sit in the fried rice for awhile, they will get overcooked.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNext, it’s time to add your oil. Don’t be shy here: This is fried rice after all, so add enough to coat all of the grains in the oil. Add in your ginger and garlic: This will help flavor the oil which will transfer to your entire dish. Then, add the green onions and cook until softened, flipping and stirring frequently to prevent any burning.\n\nAdd all of your rice, tossing and stirring it constantly (I mean it!). You should see the grains start to become individual, which is the tell-tale sign of a well-done fried rice. Once you see that the rice is separating, it’s time to add your seasonings and soy sauce.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nOnce your rice is perfectly seasoned and separated, it’s time to add in your eggs and peas.

They’re just the wonderful result of what happens when you take the basics and then add a twist here and a switcheroo there, all depending on what’s fresh and seasonal and hanging out in the fridge. This chicken spinach salad is exactly one of those recipes and finds itself as my lucky lunch at least once a week.\n\nIt’s loaded with heart healthy baby spinach, sliced sweet strawberries, creamy avocado, and a simple dressing that does double duty as the chicken marinate. Cook the chicken on the stove top or on the grill and you have a salad made for filling lunches or easy dinners.\n\nIsn’t that the perfect reason to share?\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-012.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-012.jpg)\n\nWhat’s in This Strawberry Spinach Salad?\n----------------------------------------\n\nTo make this avocado, spinach, and strawberry chicken salad, you’ll need:\n\n*   Extra virgin olive oil\n*   Golden balsamic vinegar\n*   Sugar\n*   Fresh tarragon\n*   Kosher salt and pepper\n*   Chicken breasts\n*   Fresh spinach\n*   Strawberries\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Feta cheese\n*   Sliced almonds\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-020.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-020.jpg)\n\nHow to Make a Spinach and Strawberry Salad\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhisk together the balsamic dressing and pour half over the chicken. Set the chicken aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes.\n\nOnce the chicken has had time to soak up some flavor, grill until done. Then, it’s just a matter of assembling the strawberry spinach salad and digging in!\n\nCan I Use Another Leafy Green?\n------------------------------\n\nI always have fresh spinach in the fridge, where it finds its way into everything from my [breakfast fritattas](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-and-mushroom-egg-white-frittata/), to my lightened up [sweet green smoothies](https://www.foodiecrush.com/immune-booster-sweet-green-smoothie/) and [spinach lasagna](https://www.foodiecrush.com/spinach-lasagna-roll-ups/).  So it’s a natural base for this hearty salad, that works for lunch or dinner even.\n\nBut if you have kale, arugula, romaine, butter or even spring mix mingling in the crisper, by all means, use it up!\n\nCan I Use Another Berry?\n------------------------\n\nThe ying and yang of sweet strawberries with red onion and avocado is one of my favorite combos ever. However, you can always swap out raspberries or blueberries for the strawberries and instead of feta, give goat cheese a try. I have and likely will again.\n\n[![Strawberry and Avocado Spinach Salad with Chicken | #spinach #recipe #balsamic #chicken #healthy foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strawberry-and-Avocado-Spinach-Salad-with-Chicken-foodiecrush.com-022.jpg)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTips for Making Strawberry Spinach Salad\n----------------------------------------\n\n**I like to cook a few chicken breasts on Sunday or Monday** to eat during the week in salads like this.

We have spent it almost entirely doing wall prep (3 days!!) and painting (1 day) our guest bedroom and we were dead people walking at the end of yesterday. When we ventured out for dinner last night, we were so tired that we were barely able to keep our eyes open.\n\nIt was really hard work, but it paid off – the room already looks ten times better and it’s not even finished yet. We are nearly done with the ceiling and the walls (the 3rd and final coat of paint goes on tomorrow), but the skirting boards and the radiator will need to wait until our guests leave, as we don’t want to poison them with paint fumes. My brother and his partner are visiting us this Friday and, especially after the weekend we’ve had, we are really looking forward to spending some relaxing time with them. We have not seen each other for ages and they recently returned from some exciting travels, so we cannot wait to catch up and hear all they’ve been up to.\n\nWhile Duncan and myself are more into sweet kind of breakfasts, I know that my brother especially prefers a savoury brekkie. So I’ve been thinking about what I could make for him and this simple vegan breakfast bowl is what I came up with. It’s a dish that marries a lot of leftovers together and it isn’t worse for it.\n\nI used already cooked and cooled potatoes, which I pan-fried in a little olive oil. I charred some cherry toms under a hot grill until they split open and became jammy and delicious (beware as they stay dangerously hot for ages!!). I wilted some spinach that wasn’t fresh enough to put in a salad anymore and finally made vegan scrambled eggs from some silken tofu, flavoured with aromatics and magical black salt, which due to its high sulphur content, makes tofu taste like eggs.\n\nIt may sound very niche and fancy, but it’s a staple of Indian cuisine, so if you live in the UK, a well-stocked Indian-run corner store is a great place to get it. While it’s called black salt (or [kala namak](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak)), it is dusty pink when ground up fine, so keep your eyes open for that. This dish is filling, full of contrasting textures and flavours and super quick to put together. It will make an awesome savoury breakfast or brunch and I am hoping that it will make our non-vegan guests happy.\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl ingredients](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-ingredients.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl potatoes](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-potatoes.jpg)\n\n![vegan breakfast bowl portion](https://cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-breakfast-bowl-portion-800x1200.jpg)\n\n*   olive oil\n*   a bunch of cherry tomatoes on the vine\n*   250 g / 9 oz cooked and cooled small potatoes, halved\n*   salt to taste\n*   black pepper, to taste\n*   100 g / 3.5 oz baby spinach\n*   1 large shallot, finely diced\n*   1 garlic clove, finely diced\n*   300 g / 10.5 oz silken firm tofu (I use [Clearspring](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/silken-tofu))\n*   ¼ tsp turmeric, adjust to taste\n*   ¼ tsp [black salt](https://amzn.lazycatkitchen.com/kala-namak) (has eggy taste), adjust to taste\n*   ½ ripe avocado, cut in half\n\nMETHOD\n\n1.  Brush tomatoes with a little oil (keeping them on the vine if you can) and place them on a small baking tray. Stick them under a grill / broiler for 5-10 minutes, until their skins burst and the tops char a little. Season and set aside.\n2.  Heat up 2 tsp of olive oil on a small frying pan. Place cold potatoes, cut side down on the hot oil and allow them to fry gently until nicely browned. Season with salt and pepper.\n3.  Place spinach on another pan with a splash of water. Allow the spinach to wilt using gentle heat. Move it around the pan with a pair of tongs. Season and lift wilted spinach out of the pan, draining any excess water away.\n4.  Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan (I reused the one I used to wilt the spinach) and fry diced shallot and garlic on a very gentle heat.\n5.  Once shallot is translucent and garlic fragrant (but not browned), add the drained tofu. Smash it a little with the back of a spoon. Season with turmeric, black salt (it will give it eggy taste) and pepper.\n6.  Divide all the elements (including the avocado) between two bowls and drizzle with extra olive oil if needed."

Avoid spaghetti and long pasta such as tagliatelle. Rotini, bow tie, penne, and macaroni are all good alternatives for this **chicken pasta salad recipe**.\n\n![Pasta Salad](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pasta-Salad.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nWhy you’ll love this pasta salad recipe\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   This chicken pasta salad recipe is easy to make and requires minimal cooking, making it perfect for a quick and simple meal.\n*   Combining fresh vegetables, flavorful herbs, and protein-packed chicken creates a delicious and nutritious dish.\n*   The homemade dressing adds a burst of tangy and herby flavors that perfectly compliments the other ingredients, taking this chicken pasta salad to the next level.

Our pasta salad dressing has only five ingredients, including salt and pepper.\n\nTo make the pasta salad dressing, whisk white wine vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, Italian seasoning, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This dressing is pretty simple, but when mixed with pasta, chicken, tomato, avocado, and other ingredients, the flavor is amazing!\n\nTo customize your pasta salad dressing, add a tablespoon of Greek yogurt, or use apple cider vinegar for a milder taste.\n\n![chicken salad dressing recipe](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chicken-salad-dressing-recipe.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![pasta salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pasta-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\n![best salad recipe for lunch](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-salad-recipe-for-lunch.jpg)Photo credit: © Eatwell101.com\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n**How to make chicken pasta salad:**\n\n**1.** Add the shredded chicken, pasta, onion, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and basil in a large bowl.\n\n**2.** In a jar, combine the ingredients for the dressing: vinegar, Italian seasoning, Olive oil, salt and pepper.\n\n**3.** Drizzle your chicken pasta salad with the dressing.

It will act as an antioxidant.\n*   Being a **cold chicken pasta salad** makes it perfect for summer, picnics or potlucks. You can make it up to a day in advance, leaving the avocado and tomato until you are ready to serve the chicken pasta salad to keep the ingredients as fresh as possible.\n\n### Can I grill chicken instead of using rotisserie chicken?\n\nYes, of course, you can **grill chicken for this salad**. Make sure to grill chicken breasts or pan-sear on medium-low heat, so chicken doesn’t burn while undercooked in the inside. When out of fresh chicken, we like to use a bag of frozen grilled organic chicken breasts that we heat up in a skillet and use for the salad.\n\n### How to Store the Chicken Pasta Salad?\n\nThis chicken pasta salad keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days if stored in an air-tight container. Don’t keep it for more than that because the avocado will turn brown. You may have to toss the chicken pasta salad leftovers to redistribute the dressing before serving. If you want to make it ahead of time, omit the avocado, you’ll add them at the very last minute.\n\n### What other readers say about this chicken pasta salad\n\n“This was so good and the perfect lunch. Changes: I added black olives, cucumber and matchstick carrots. I forgot to add the basil and it was fine without it.” – Maureen\n\n“Just made this chicken pasta salad for our dinner. Will definitely make it again. Perfect for summer. Added some fire roasted corn and served the dressing on the side with croutons.” – Nancy\n\n“Delicious! Husband loved it!

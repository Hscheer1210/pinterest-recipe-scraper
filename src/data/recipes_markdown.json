The 5 ingredient vinaigrette is both sweet and tangy and marries all of the salad ingredients together. It's tender, easy to prep, and the most perfect beginning or side dish for any meal.\n\n![roasted delicata squash salad on a platter with pomegranates and feta cheese](https://themovementmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Roasted-Delicata-Squash-Salad-3.jpg)\n\nWhat's inside this delicata squash salad?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis beautiful salad comes together pretty quickly. The delicata squash is the star, and the rest of the ingredients do a really wonderful job highlighting it and letting it shine.\n\nYou only need 5 ingredients to make the salad and the vinaigrette, so your entire shopping list is going to be short and sweet. Here's what you need to grab:\n\n*   Delicata Squash\n*   Arugula\n*   Feta cheese\n*   Pomegranate arils/seeds\n*   Pistachios\n\nThe maple vinaigrette is made with:\n\n*   Extra virgin olive oil\n*   Rice vinegar\n*   Coconut aminos\n*   Maple syrup\n*   Dijon mustard\n\n![bowl of cut up delicata squash half moons](https://themovementmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Roasted-Delicata-Squash-Salad-6.jpg)\n\nI cannot wait to serve up this salad on Thanksgiving at our house this year. I am going to have a full spread with plenty of salad, side dishes, and most likely a roasted ham.\n\nWe've been making some form of delicata squash salad for years and years, but I've never sat down and written out the recipe.\n\nThis delicata squash salad can be enjoyed as is or you can kick things up several notches.\n\n*   **Add protein**: If you'd like to make this a full meal, feel free to add grilled shrimp or chicken.\n*   **Change the temperature**: Feel free to eat this salad cold. It will totally change the taste and feeling this dish gives you.\n*   **Add extra vegetables**: You can add onions, shaved brussels sprouts, radicchio, etc.\n*   **Add extra fruit**: Add dried cherries, raisins or cranberries for some extra fruity flavors.\n\n![delicata squash salad on a large platter with a serving spoon](https://themovementmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Roasted-Delicata-Squash-Salad-.jpg)\n\nTips and Tricks\n---------------\n\n*   You can prep this salad 1-2 days in advance and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n*   Store the dressing on the side or the entire salad will become limp and soggy.\n*   Use your favorite nut. This salad would taste delicious with chopped pecans as well.\n*   If you aren't into feta cheese, feel free to use goat or omit the cheese altogether.\n\n![ingredients for delicata squash salad in a large bowl ](https://themovementmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Roasted-Delicata-Squash-Salad-5.jpg)\n\nHow to make roasted delicata squash salad\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, and adjust the oven rack to the middle position.** Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.\n\n**Combine all of the maple vinaigrette ingredients together in a small bowl until creamy throughout and set aside.**\n\n**Cut delicata squash in half, length wise and trim off the ends.** Scoop out all of the seeds and stringy bits. Cut into ½\" thick half moons and transfer to a large bowl.\n\n**Add oil and salt to the bowl with delicata squash and mix thoroughly until everything is evenly coated.** Transfer to prepared baking sheets in a single layer, leaving room in between each piece to allow them to crisp up slightly.\n\n**Bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through.** If you'd like them a bit more well done, turn the oven to a low broil for 4-5 minutes afterwards. Set aside to slightly cool.\n\n**Combine the rest of the salad ingredients together on a platter or in a large serving bowl.** Add delicata squash and stir to combine. Top off with maple vinaigrette or serve on the side. Taste for additional salt and pepper.\n\n![delicata squash salad on a plate with a fork on the side and pomegranates](https://themovementmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Roasted-Delicata-Squash-Salad.jpg)\n\nI'd recommend pouring half of the dressing over the salad to start. Give it a nice massage, and add a little more to taste.\n\nYou may end up using it all, but I don't recommend dumping it all at once.\n\nMy favorite part of this salad (besides the delicata squash) is definitely the pomegranate arils.\n\nYou can eat this salad for breakfast or serve it as a side dish to your favorite meal. That's what I am doing this year.\n\nIt will be the first dish on our table for Thanksgiving, and I cannot wait to wow my whole family with this deliciousness.\n\n![roasted delicata squash salad on a serving platter with pistachios, pomegranates, and feta cheese](https://themovementmenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Roasted-Delicata-Squash-Salad-2.jpg)\n\nMore easy and healthy salad recipes like this:\n----------------------------------------------\n\n[Paleo Pesto Chicken Salad](https://themovementmenu.com/paleo-pesto-chicken-salad/)\n\n[Whole30 Greek Salad](https://themovementmenu.com/whole30-greek-salad/)\n\n[Roasted Butternut Squash Salad with Kale](https://themovementmenu.com/roasted-butternut-squash-salad/)\n\n[Buffalo Paleo Potato Salad](https://themovementmenu.com/buffalo-paleo-potato-salad-whole30/)\n\n[Paleo Strawberry Avocado Salad](https://themovementmenu.com/paleo-strawberry-avocado-salad/)\n\n#### Salad\n\n*   ▢ 2 medium delicata squash, about 1 ½ pounds\n*   ▢ 1 ½ tablespoons [avocado oil](https://amzn.to/3VvD2nB)\n*   ▢ kosher salt to taste\n*   ▢ ½ pound arugula\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup pistachios\n*   ▢ 4 ounces feta cheese\n*   ▢ ½ cup pomegranate arils\n*   ▢ salt to taste\n*   ▢ black pepper to taste\n\n[Add to Shopping List](https://themovementmenu.com/shopping-list/)\n\n*   Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, and adjust the oven rack to the middle position.

Perfect for summer bbq’s and picnics!_ \n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nHey y’all! Guess I’m a Texan now, cause that just rolls off the tongue a little too easy 🙂 As some of you know, I’m a meal planning crazy. It comes in handy most of the time, but is also a curse at moments. Like, for instance, when Kev wants to wrap his scrambled eggs in a tortilla for breakfast and I practically fall out of my chair in protest because those were so specifically reserved for quesadillas and enchiladas this week. Or like when I have an itch to get creative in the kitchen, but I literally have no ingredients that aren’t already promised to another dish.\n\nI’m a big fan of getting my meals organized at the beginning of the week because it takes so much stress out of the day to day, but I’m also trying to teach myself about flexibility and adaptability when things don’t go as planned.\n\nThis week when I was trying to plan my meals, my brain froze trying trying to piece all the days together. I was struggling trying to figure out what I was going to make for our small group and how I could tie that in with the blog and the recipes I need to test for my contribution to Pressure Cooking Today, and on top of that figuring out if we have enough for lunch and dinners for the week! It can be a lot, and I know many of you are also having a hard time trying to figure out this whole meal planning thing.\n\nI’ve found that in these busy summer months, it’s most simple to have a rotating schedule of recipes that are my go to’s for the nights at home, and then when we have special occasions or bbq’s to attend, those are the times that I’ll add a fun new recipe into the rotation. That way all I have to figure out for the week is which of my stand by recipes I need to make for dinner and then add any extra ingredients to the shopping list for outside engagements.\n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-4.jpg)\n\nThis Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad is one of my favorite recipes to throw together with minimal labor, minimal cost, and it’s something that almost everyone loves! I tend to go simple with pasta salad because why overcomplicate something that’s so good already with only a couple of ingredients?\n\nIn the time it takes the pasta to cook, I can get my dressing whisked together and my veggies chopped and ready, only leaving me to combine the pasta with the rest of the goodies! I love the [balsamic](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9123169-13305110?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthrivemarket.com%2Fp%2Fkitchen-love-balsamic-vinegar-of-modena-premium&cjsku=728119099486) and lemon combination because it adds a zing to the crisp veggies and pairs well with the bright flavor of the fresh parsley.\n\nI prefer my Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad cold, but if you like it slightly warm, you can assemble your veggies and dressing, stir with the warm pasta right out of the pot, and serve immediately!\n\nBon Appetit!\n\n![Colorful pasta salad on a blue napkin.](https://www.kitschencat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Balsamic-Pasta-Salad-3.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://www.kitschencat.com/lemon-balsamic-summer-pasta-salad/print/6406/)\n\n### Description\n\n_Lemon Balsamic Summer Pasta Salad is a light and fresh mix of pasta and your favorite veggies.

    "markdown": "# Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash - Dishing Out Health\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

In the recipe card below, you’ll find a go-to dough recipe that I use for all types of flatbread and pizza recipes. In fact, I even used this same dough recipe in my [**_Wrapped Asparagus Spears_**](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wrapped-asparagus-spears-with-garlic-butter-and-parmesan/) recipe. It’s a completely versatile and adaptable dough.\n\nThere are several types of bread that can fall into the flatbread category. Some of them have yeast and some don’t. I tend to like a little bit of yeast in my flatbread and pizza dough. Not so much that it puffs up a lot, just enough so that it’s more substantial.\n\nMake your own online recipe box!\n--------------------------------\n\n**Click the in the lower right corner of your screen  \n& follow the quick and easy instructions!**\n\n### FLATBREAD OPTIONS\n\nIf you’re not feeling up to making your own dough at home, you can certainly buy pre-made flatbread and still make a great-tasting dinner. I have often purchased flatbread at the grocer and topped it with sauce, cheese, and our favourite toppings. It’s a great way to whip up dinner in a hurry. And, it’s a lot cheaper than pizza delivery!\n\nThis recipe will work perfectly with focaccia, even though it’s a very thick type of flatbread. Naan works very well! Roti will work well too, especially if you’re looking for unleavened bread. (Unleavened is a term that applies to breads that do not include an ingredient such as yeast which makes the bread rise and proof. Most flat types of bread and unleavened breads.)\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

I had made up a double batch of the dough a little while ago and decided to make a **_[Traditional Newfoundland Pizza](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/homemade-newfoundland-pizza/)_** for myself and McKenna. I knew John.e wouldn’t eat it, because Newfie pizza is a far cry from being vegetarian.\n\nArmed with black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta, I decided to make a Mediterranean-style flatbread for him. If you’ve been a reader of this blog for any serious amount of time, you would have known that this flatbread wasn’t for me as soon as you looked at the photographs.\n\nI refuse to eat black olives, but John.e loves them. To date, there are over 500 recipes here at Lord Byron’s Kitchen, and this is only the second recipe that features black olives. My [**_Warm Farro Salad_**](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/warm-farro-salad/) has black olives in it too. I can’t make _all_ of the recipes for myself. I have to be nice and make a recipe or two with ingredients that I don’t really care for, right?\n\n### CHANGE IT UP; MAKE IT YOUR OWN!\n\nNow, just because this particular flatbread is modelled after common Mediterranean ingredients, that doesn’t mean you are stuck making your version the exact same way. You can add any toppings you like to your flatbread. You can even make one very large flatbread or two smaller ones like I made.\n\nMost kids are picky eaters, so you might want to change up the black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta. I’ve used this same technique described in the recipe card and added just cheese and pepperoni on many occasions. The recipe is very forgiving and completely adaptable.\n\nIf by chance you or your family cannot finish the flatbread – no worries! Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread can be saved and reheated later. Let the flatbread completely cool and then refrigerate. When ready to reheat, wrap loosely in aluminum foil and bake for 5-7 minutes in a 350-degree preheated oven.\n\nThe aluminum foil should not touch the top of the pizza but should cover it. This will prevent the toppings from burning, and will also prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil. If you freeze the leftovers, allow the flatbread to thaw completely at room temperature before attempting to reheat.\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

For exact amounts and measurements, refer to the printable recipe card located near the bottom of this post.\n\n#### FOR THE DOUGH:\n\n*   **_Active Dry Yeast_** – Do not confuse this with Instant Yeast. Active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water before using, while instant yeast can be mixed right into dry ingredients.\n*   **_Olive Oil_** – You can also use vegetable, canola, avocado oil, etc.\n*   **_Sugar_** – This might seem odd, but the sugar makes for a tastier dough, plus, it gives the yeast something to feed on which promotes proofing or rising.\n*   **_Flour_** – I only ever used all-purpose unbleached flour in my dough. I have not experimented with other flour options at this point.\n*   **_Warm Water_** – The water should be as close to 110 degrees F as possible. Too hot and you will kill the yeast; too cold and it won’t activate properly.\n*   **_Salt_**\n\n#### Lord Byron’s Notes\n\nActive Dry Yeast and Instant Yeast are essentially the same thing and both of them will give you the same result in the end. The difference is that active dry yeast works more slowly than instant yeast and is often used in recipes where water is mixed with the yeast to activate it before the dry ingredients are added to prepare the dough. In contrast, instant yeast works much faster and does not need to be activated by water. It is almost always mixed right into the dry ingredients.\n\n**Scroll down to the comment section and write me a message.**\n\n_I will personally respond as soon as possible!_\n\n#### FOR THE TOPPINGS:\n\nThese toppings are just suggestions. You can change it up and make a flatbread that suits your personal tastes.\n\n*   **_Mozzarella_** – Use fresh mozzarella and slice it about 1/4 inch thick.\n*   **_Sun Dried Tomatoes_** – Use the ones packed in oil. They have better flavour.\n*   **_Black Olives_** – I do not like olives at all, but I made this flatbread for John.e and he loves them. You can use green or none at all if that’s what pleases you.\n*   **_Feta_** – I love crumbled feta on flatbread, especially when it is a Mediterranean-inspired flatbread!\n*   **_Dried Herbs_** – Basil and oregano are perfect on this one!\n*   **_Parsley_** – Used for garnish and is optional.\n*   **_Egg_** – Beat with a little bit of water, this is used to brush the outside of the dough. It helps to brown the dough so that it looks better. You can skip this too if you wish.\n*   **_Non-stick Cooking Spray_**\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes! Simply change the toppings to suit your preferences! #flatbread #pizza #Mediterranean #homemade #recipe](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Homemade-Mediterranean-Flatbread-b-532x800.jpg)\n\n### HOW TO MAKE FLATBREAD:\n\n#### Let’s make the dough first!\n\nLet’s start with preparing the dough. If you have purchased dough from the grocer, follow the instructions on the package. Otherwise, make the dough from scratch by following these simple instructions.\n\nFill a mixing bowl with hot tap water. This will temper the bowl which is important to yeast activation and growth. Measure out 3/4 cup of water that’s 110 degrees F. Pour the water out of the bowl. Place one teaspoon of sugar into the bottom of the bowl and pour over the 3/4 cup of water. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water and let sit for two minutes.\n\nNext, whisk in the olive oil. Add the flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir the flour into the water and oil. Use your hand to knead the dough until it forms a smooth ball. Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside to rise. (Be sure to keep away from drafts or an open window.)\n\n![](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-800x533.jpg)\n\n#### Now, the fun part! Let’s assemble the flatbread!\n\nOnce the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F, and lightly spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Using only half of the dough per sheet pan, place the dough onto the pan and use a rolling pin to roll it out into an oblong or rectangular shape.\n\nNext, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough. Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n\nNext, top each pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta. Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano. Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if you are using it, and slice the flatbread into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes! Simply change the toppings to suit your preferences! #flatbread #pizza #Mediterranean #homemade #recipe](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6-1-533x800.jpg)\n\n### RECIPE TIPS & TRICKS\n\nThe key to a really good flatbread is the dough. You can use the dough recipe here and create any flavour of flatbread that you want. I have made this same dough and spread sun-dried tomato pesto on it with some mozzarella and pepperoni for a make-at-home pizza. I’ve also mixed together equal parts butter and parmesan cheese with a clove of minced garlic and a little splash of olive oil. Spread it over the dough and bake until bubbly. You now have easy garlic fingers! Be sure to dip them in my **_[Donair Sauce](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/newfoundland-donair-sauce/)_**!\n\nYou can also make the dough ahead of time. Once the dough has had time to rise, transfer it to a food-safe plastic bag. Get as much air out of the bag as possible and place the dough in the refrigerator. The dough will last in the fridge for 3-5 days. Once you’re ready to make your flatbread, remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out just like the recipe instructions indicate.\n\nIf you have any leftover flatbread, you can refrigerate it for 2-3 days and reheat it later. You can microwave it, but be sure to do so on half speed/power, otherwise, the crust gets a little chewy. You can also place the flatbread on a baking sheet and toss it in the oven. Set the oven to 200 degrees F and let it go for 5 minutes.\n\n### SERVING SUGGESTIONS\n\nIf you follow my Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread recipe exactly as written, you might want to continue the theme if you are looking to feed a larger group of people. I do this simply by adding side dishes that will complement the main. In the case of this flatbread, I would serve it with this **_[Greek Potato Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/greek-potato-salad/)_** or this **_[Cucumber Walnut Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/cucumber-walnut-salad/)_** or this **_[Fire Roasted Tomato and Artichoke Bean Salad](https://www.lordbyronskitchen.com/fire-roasted-tomato-artichoke-bean-skillet/)_**!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

This will temper the bowl and help to ensure the yeast will properly activate. While you’re waiting for the bowl to warm, preheat the oven to 500 degrees – not broil, but degrees.\n    \n*   Pour the hot water out of the bowl and wipe the bowl dry. Add the warm tap water and the yeast. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the yeast into the water for no more than 5-10 seconds. Set aside and let the yeast bubble and foam for at least 3 minutes.\n    \n*   Sift together 2 cups of the flour, salt, and sugar.\n    \n*   Add the olive oil to the yeast and water mixture. Stir for a few seconds. Pour in the entire flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed.\n    \n*   Sprinkle your clean countertop with a little flour and empty the dough out. Knead the dough together for 4-5 minutes until a dough ball is formed. Place the dough back into the metal mixing bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and set the bowl on top of your preheating oven. (Don't place the bowl on a burner, just on the surface of the oven. The heat will help the dough to proof/rise.) Let the dough sit for five minutes.\n    \n\n#### For the Pizza:\n\n*   Lightly spray two small baking sheets or pizza pans with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.\n    \n*   When the dough is ready, lightly flour a flat surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a rectangular shape about the size of your pan.  Place the dough onto the baking sheet and push the dough into the corners and up to the sides. This does not need to be perfectly round or rectangular. Just be sure the dough is evenly flattened. (Repeat with the other half of the dough on a second baking sheet or pizza pan.)\n    \n*   Next, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough.\n    \n*   Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter.\n    \n*   Next, top each pizza with the sun dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta.\n    \n*   Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano.\n    \n*   Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Garnish with the chopped parsley, if using, and slice into wedges. Serve immediately.  Enjoy!\n    \n\nCalories: 662kcal | Carbohydrates: 63g | Protein: 30g | Fat: 33g | Saturated Fat: 16g | Cholesterol: 135mg | Sodium: 1315mg | Potassium: 408mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 935IU | Vitamin C: 15.3mg | Calcium: 539mg | Iron: 4.9mg\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n-------------------------\n\nUpload a photo and tag me so that I can see it!\n\n![Fast, easy, and delicious Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread-style pizza in less than thirty minutes!

In Italy, pizza Bianca is a pizza with mozzarella and/or parmesan cheese with a drizzle of olive oil and salt.\n\n*   ![Whole white pizza on the baking sheet, ricotta cheese spread and sautéed mushroom and spinach on top of the pizza](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole white pizza on the baking sheet before baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-2-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![whole white pizza after baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-3-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole mushroom spinach white pizza on the baking sheet after baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-4-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n\nConventional white pizza VS. my white pizza\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you search for white pizza recipes, you will come across many recipes with alfredo-like sauce for the pizza. The white pizza sauce is often made with butter, milk, parmesan cheese, and/or cream cheese. Mine **requires NO white sauce**. So what goes into my white pizza? Read on!\n\nIngredients in Mushroom Spinach White Pizza\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Pizza dough** - You can use store-bought dough. But I have [an easy pizza dough recipe (using a stand mixer)](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/fool-proof-easy-pizza-dough-recipe/) right here! Don't have a stand mixer? No problem! Check out my [pizza dough recipe by hand](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/easy-pizza-dough-recipe-without-a-stand-mixer-with-active-dry-yeast/) here.\n*   **Ricotta cheese** - this is an equivalent ingredient to a white sauce\n*   **Herbs** - I like to use Italian dried herbs with extra dried basil\n*   **Mushroom** - You can use any type of mushroom. I used button mushroom for this recipe. \n*   **Spinach** \\- I like to sauteed fresh baby spinach leaves.\n*   **Shredded mozzarella**  \n\n*   ![Whole white pizza with extra dollops of ricotta cheese on top, before baking in the oven](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-8-667x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Whole white pizza with extra dollops of ricotta cheese on top](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-9-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n\nHow to customize\n----------------\n\n*   You can always put **dollops of ricotta** on your pizza for extra creaminess\n*   **Experiment with other cheese** - People told me they added dollops of **goat cheese** for tanginess, **grated parmesan cheese**, and even **Mexican blend** shredded cheese\n*   **Other toppings** \\- Artichoke, tomato (sun-dried or slices), fresh basil, arugula, caramelized onions will all make great toppings\n*   **Elevate your pizza crust** by brush with garlic butter or stuff it with mozzarella or leftover ricotta cheese mixture\n\nHow to reheat the pizza\n-----------------------\n\nThere are several ways to reheat your pizza. \n\n1.  **Microwave** - it is the most convenient way to reheat the pizza but it will make your pizza very chewy, especially the crust part. \n2.  **On a stovetop** - You can reheat your pizza on **a skillet with a lid on top**. This will reheat your pizza nicely with your cheese all gooey and melty without changing the texture of the crust. \n3.  **Toaster oven/oven** - This is another convenient way but I like the toaster oven option (350F for 5-6 minutes) better since I don't have to preheat the oven. However, it takes a longer time to reheat. \n4.  **Air fryer** - This is my recently discovered way! You can place the pizza slices in the air fryer basket and cook between 320F to 330F for 2-4 minutes. It's a speedy and delicious way to reheat your leftover pizza.\n\n*   ![Two slices of white pizza on a white plate with the glass of rose in the background](http://www.myeclecticbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/30-inutes-Mushroom-Spinach-White-Pizza-18-683x1024.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Two slices of white pizza with dollops of extra ricotta cheese on top.

Takes less than 30 minutes to make this deliciousness!\n\n*   **Prep Time:** 15 minutes\n*   **Cook Time:** 30 minutes\n*   **Total Time:** 45 minutes\n*   **Yield:** 2 large pizzas 1x\n*   **Category:** Main course\n*   **Method:** Bake\n*   **Cuisine:** Italian-Inspired\n*   **Diet:** Vegetarian\n\n*   1.5 lb of pizza dough of your choice (or half of either [this recipe (using a stand mixer](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/fool-proof-easy-pizza-dough-recipe/)) or this [pizza dough recipe by hand](https://www.myeclecticbites.com/easy-pizza-dough-recipe-without-a-stand-mixer-with-active-dry-yeast/)), divide in half\n    \n*   1 cup ricotta cheese, (plus 2\\-3 tablespoons, optional)\n*   ½ teaspoon salt\n*   ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning\n    \n*   ½ teaspoon dried basil\n    \n*   1 package button mushroom, sliced\n    \n*   1 teaspoon butter\n    \n*   ¼ teaspoon dried thyme\n    \n*   2-3 cups baby spinach leaves\n    \n*   1 teaspoon oil\n    \n*   ½ teaspoon garlic powder \n    \n*   ⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n    \n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n    \n*   ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)\n    \n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n1.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\n2.  On a medium-size non-stick skillet, add the sliced mushroom and cook on high heat for a couple of minutes. The water from the mushroom will start to extract and evaporate.\n3.  Once the water from the mushroom started to evaporate and the mushroom turns slightly brown, add the butter and dried thyme to the mushroom. Stir frequently and cook for an additional minute or two. Take them off the skillet and set them aside.\n4.  On the same skillet, add the oil and spinach leaves. Sprinkle garlic powder and pinch of salt to the spinach and cook until all the spinach leaves are wilted, about 3-5 minutes. \n5.  When the spinach is wilted, take it off from the heat and set it aside.\n6.  In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup of ricotta cheese, ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and ½ teaspoon of dried basil. \n7.  Divide the pizza dough in half.\n8.  Flour the working surface and start stretching the dough flat. Do the same for the other dough.\n9.  Spread the ricotta mixture to each of the stretched pizza dough evenly and thinly. \n10.  Add the cooked mushroom and spinach to both pizzas.\n11.  Add ⅓ cup of shredded mozzarella cheese (each) on top of the pizzas.\n12.  Sprinkle red pepper flakes if you like spicy pizza. If not, skip this step.\n13.  Sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top.\n14.  Place the pizzas in the oven and cook for 11-12 minutes. \n15.  Take them out of the oven and enjoy them right away.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   Red pepper flakes are totally optional. If you don't like spicy food, please skip this ingredient altogether. \n*   If you like creamy pizza, dollops of ricotta will totally give you that creaminess.\n*   Other great topping options are grated parmesan cheese and/or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. \n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------"

    "markdown": "# Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Arugula and Feta - Peas and Crayons\n_This Mediterranean Pasta Salad is tossed with tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, arugula, and feta then tossed with a tasty homemade lemon dressing! Bringing it to a party or picnic? It can easily be made in advance the day before!_\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Arugula and Feta](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-4.jpg)\n\nBeing a food blogger means I’m often playing a never-ending game of Chopped in which I have to use up all the random ingredients I buy for one recipe up by creating other recipes with the leftovers.\n\nIf I purchase a big bunch of cilantro just to use a few sprigs as a garnish, you bet your booty I’ll be putting cilantro in my next 2-3 recipes until I’ve used it all up. (I mean is this not the tastiest problem to have? haha!)\n\nToday’s recipe was inspired by a surplus of arugula in my fridge.\n\nThis peppery leafy green was the \\*perfect\\* not-so-secret ingredient for this tasty Mediterranean pasta salad!\n\nI paired it with a fresh lemon dressing (lemon and arugula are a match made in heaven!) and a whole lot of veggies! A little feta here… a sprinkle of cracked black pepper there… and I am in LOVE!\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Lemon Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-2.jpg)\n\ncan I add extra veggies?\n------------------------\n\nYes! Yes! 1000x yes! This Mediterranean pasta salad would be the perfect base for all your favorite veggies.\n\nFeel free to raid you pantry for artichoke hearts or olives or empty your crisper drawer! You can add fresh basil, spinach, onion, bell pepper, and more.\n\nFor the noodles, I used bowtie (farfalle) pasta but there are a ton of varieties that work great here! You can use ditalini, orzo, elbow noodles, rotini, or even tortellini!\n\npasta salad dressing\n--------------------\n\nI’m a big fan of homemade salad dressing because 1. They’re CRAZY quick + easy to make and 2. I pretty much always have all the ingredients I need lying around.\n\nI paired this pretty pasta salad with a fresh [lemon dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2019/03/lemon-dressing.html) but there are a few others that would also work positively fantastic here. No fresh lemons on hand? Try it with my easy homemade [Greek Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/12/easy-homemade-greek-dressing-recipe.html) or [Italian Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2015/06/easy-homemade-italian-dressing.html), both of which pair oh so perfectly with pasta and veggies.\n\nMake a little… or a lot! This pasta salad yields 8-10 side dish sized servings.\n\nThe leftovers are oh so tasty (my husband and I are all about meal prepping cold pasta salad for the week) but if you’d like a smaller batch, feel free to halve it. Need to serve a crowd at a party or barbecue? Simply double or triple the recipe below and you’re good to go!\n\n![Mediterranean Pasta Salad with Arugula and Feta](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/healthy-mediterranean-pasta-salad-lemon-dressing-4-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 8 oz farfalle (bowtie) pasta\n*   ▢ 3 cups chopped fresh arugula\n*   ▢ 1/2-3/4 English cucumber\n*   ▢ 1 cup diced tomato\n*   ▢ 1 avocado\n*   ▢ ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP fresh chopped parsley (optional)\n\n#### LEMON DRESSING\\*\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2fyn7A)\n*   ▢ ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (via 1-2 large lemons)\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp lemon zest plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP plain dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 2 cloves garlic, freshly. minced\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp dried oregano leaves\n*   ▢ ¼ tsp salt\n*   ▢ ⅛ tsp black pepper\n\n*   First let's make the dressing! Zest 1 lemon and set aside. Juice your lemons to yield 1/4 cup of juice and add to a small/medium mason jar. Add lemon zest and remaining dressing ingredients and close lid tightly. Shake to emulsify the dressing.\n    \n*   Next cook pasta via package instructions. For farfalle you'll boil the pasta in water for approx. 12-14 minutes.\n    \n*   Chop arugula, cucumber, tomato and optional parsley and add to a large bowl. Save the avocado for just before serving.\n    \n*   Once your pasta is perfectly al dente, strain in a colander and run cold water to halt the cooking process and chill the pasta slightly. Then add the drained pasta to your veggies an toss together. \n    \n*   Shake once more if needed and add your dressing to the salad. Toss well to coat. Lastly add avocado and feta on top and gently fold into the salad. Add extra salt and pepper if desired and enjoy!\n    \n\n\\* If leftover dressing is desired (hello meal prep!) or if you're making this salad in advance, simply double the dressing recipe. When it chills in the fridge, the pasta soaks up much of the dressing. Simply refresh with an extra drizzle or so of dressing before serving, or let guests add extra to taste. Enjoy!\n\nNo bowtie pasta? No problem! Try it with ditalini, orzo, elbow, rotini, or even tortellini!\n\nSee post for a list of tasty extras and swaps.\n\n_Nutrition Facts below are estimated using an online recipe nutrition calculator. Adjust as needed based on extras added and enjoy!_\n\nCalories: 245kcal, Carbohydrates: 26g, Protein: 6g, Fat: 13g, Saturated Fat: 2g, Cholesterol: 8mg, Sodium: 229mg, Potassium: 320mg, Fiber: 3g, Sugar: 2g, Vitamin A: 390IU, Vitamin C: 11.4mg, Calcium: 84mg, Iron: 1.1mg\n\nNeed to make a vegan version? Simply skip the feta and this salad is gloriously vegan. The creamy feta cuts a bit of the acidity of the lemon dressing so if you find it super tart, feel free to add a tsp or so of sugar or maple syrup to the dressing to taste.\n\nIf you get a chance to try this quick and easy Mediterranean Pasta Salad, let me know! Leave some love in the comment form below or tag your photos with @peasandcrayons on Instagram so I can happy dance over your creation!

It's helped people lose weight, and in [one study](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y), it helped [reduce symptoms of depression](https://www.purewow.com/food/mood-boost-mediterranean-diet). Beyond that, the core ingredients of the diet also make for plenty of easy, nutritious snacks. So toss aside that bag of chips—here are 30 Mediterranean diet snacks (like [veggie sushi](https://www.purewow.com/recipes/Veggie-Sushi) and [pizza trail mix](https://www.purewow.com/recipes/pizza-trail-mix)) that are as satisfying, easy to make and portable as they are good for you.\n\nWhat Is the Mediterranean Diet?\n-------------------------------\n\nAs the name suggests, the [Mediterranean diet](https://www.purewow.com/food/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan) focuses on foods that are found in the Mediterranean (that includes palces like Greece, Italy and the Middle East). No food groups are off the table: You can eat everything from [chickpeas](https://www.purewow.com/food/recipes-to-make-with-chickpeas), quinoa, feta cheese, grapes, olive oil, Greek yogurt, [fish](https://www.purewow.com/food/easy-fish-recipes) and the like.\n\nWhat’s more, this diet is plant-focused but includes animal-sourced protein, seafood and dairy in small quantities, plus grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruits, veggies, olive oil and even wine in moderation, so it’s great for all people. Because it’s not restrictive, this is a diet with no risks, but it is particularly suited for those with heart disease, high blood pressure, depression and dementia, according to the [Harvard T.H.

    "markdown": "# Easy Mediterranean Diet Recipes\nFor the sixth year in a row, the Mediterranean diet has been named the [No. 1 diet by U.S. News & World Report](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021106/best-and-worst-diets-2023-us-news-world-report/). From breakfast to dinner, these easy Mediterranean diet recipes are packed with ingredients like fresh vegetables, whole grains and lean protein like fish and chicken. Plus, this eating pattern is intentionally flexible so it can be customized for any flavor preferences and dietary needs. Nutritious recipes like our Garlic Roasted Salmon & Brussels Sprouts and our Berry Chia Pudding are healthy, delicious meals that will help you follow the eating pattern with ease.\n\nSheet-Pan Chicken Thighs with Brussels Sprouts & Gnocchi\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this healthy dinner recipe, chicken thighs, Brussels sprouts, cherry tomatoes and packaged gnocchi are all roasted on the same sheet pan for a complete meal that couldn't be easier to make. And though it's simple, this dish gets tons of flavor from seasonings, including garlic, oregano and red-wine vinegar. It all adds up to a dish that's ready to go into heavy weeknight rotation in your house.\n\nEgg Sandwiches with Rosemary, Tomato & Feta\n-------------------------------------------\n\nPhotographer /Antonis Achilleos, Prop Stylist / Kay Clarke, Food Stylist / Emily Nabors Hall\n\nThese hearty breakfast sandwiches are packed with ingredients popular in the Mediterranean diet, including feta, tomato and spinach.\n\nMushroom & Tofu Stir-Fry\n------------------------\n\nThis tofu veggie stir-fry is quick and easy, making it a great go-to weeknight meal. Baked tofu has a firm, toothsome texture that crisps well in a hot pan. You can find it in flavors like teriyaki and sesame, both of which are delicious here. Or opt for a smoked version, which has the same texture with a more robust flavor. Serve over brown rice.\n\nChickpea & Quinoa Bowl with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nQuinoa and chickpeas pack this vegetarian grain bowl with plenty of plant-based protein. Whip up a batch of these flavorful grain bowls and pack them in lidded containers to stash in the fridge for easy, healthy grab-and-go lunches all week long.\n\nGarlic Roasted Salmon & Brussels Sprouts\n----------------------------------------\n\nRoasting salmon on top of Brussels sprouts and garlic, flavored with wine and fresh oregano, is simple enough for a weeknight meal yet sophisticated enough to serve to company. Serve with whole-wheat couscous.\n\nOne-Pot Spinach, Chicken Sausage & Feta Pasta\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA little bit of Sunday meal prep goes a long way in this one-dish pasta recipe. The pasta is cooked ahead of time and stored in the fridge to use for meals all week, but any leftover cooked pasta you have on hand will do. Chicken sausage with feta is especially good in this recipe.\n\nSalmon Pita Sandwich\n--------------------\n\nThis quick lunch recipe is loaded with heart-healthy omega-3s, thanks to the canned sockeye salmon. If you're bringing this sandwich for lunch, keep the salmon salad separate and stuff the pita just before eating.\n\nQuinoa & Chia Oatmeal Mix\n-------------------------\n\nMake your own hot cereal mix with this healthy recipe. Keep it on hand and just cook up the amount you need when you're ready for a hot breakfast. One serving of the warm cereal contains 6 grams of fiber—almost a quarter of your daily quota.\n\nSkillet Lemon Chicken & Potatoes with Kale\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis easy one-pan skillet-roasted lemon chicken is perfect for weeknight dinners. Juicy chicken thighs are cooked in the same pan as baby potatoes and kale for a satisfying meal with the added bonus of minimal cleanup.\n\nCharred Shrimp, Pesto & Quinoa Bowls\n------------------------------------\n\nThese shrimp, pesto and quinoa bowls are delicious, healthy, pretty and take less than 30 minutes to prep. In other words, they're basically the ultimate easy weeknight dinner. Feel free to add additional vegetables and swap the shrimp for chicken, steak, tofu or edamame.\n\nSpinach Ravioli with Artichokes & Olives\n----------------------------------------\n\nStore-bought spinach ravioli and a handful of basic pantry items are all you need to get a healthy dinner on the table in 15 minutes. Ingredients like oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, briny Kalamata olives and toasty pine nuts help to build big flavor fast. If you can't find frozen artichokes, swap in a 15-ounce can (just be sure to drain and rinse them well).\n\nBerry Chia Pudding\n------------------\n\nChia seeds are a good source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids, plus they have fiber, iron and calcium. Here they're mixed with a fruity base and refrigerated until the chia seeds expand to form a thick, creamy texture similar to tapioca. Pudding for breakfast? We're in.\n\nChickpea & Roasted Red Pepper Lettuce Wraps with Tahini Dressing\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA tangy, nutty tahini dressing brings together no-cook ingredients like canned chickpeas and roasted red peppers for these easy meal-prep lettuce wraps. Make these wraps ahead of time for a grab-and-go lunch or dinner. A few wedges of warm pita finish off the meal perfectly.\n\nKung Pao Tofu\n-------------\n\nLaura Kanya; Breana Killeen (Food Styling)\n\nKung pao sauce is typically made with dark soy sauce and sugar—we lightened it up in calories but still kept the dark color by swapping in a touch of molasses. Cooking the tofu and vegetables over high heat means they get crisp on the outside but stay tender in the center.\n\nShrimp, Avocado & Feta Wrap\n---------------------------\n\nThis easy wrap makes a great healthy lunch to pack for work. Buy cooked shrimp in the seafood department at most supermarkets and grocery stores, or check the freezer section for tailed and deveined shrimp that are easy to thaw and steam. Salty feta and chopped fresh vegetables keep this easy lunchtime wrap flavorful and satisfying.\n\nSheet-Pan Roasted Salmon & Vegetables\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis dish is packed with flavor and fits perfectly into a Mediterranean diet.\n\nCucumber Salad, Hummus & Pita Bento Box Lunch\n---------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy this refreshing bento box idea on your lunch break. It combines cucumber salad, hummus, pita and more for a satisfying work lunch.\n\nChicken with Tomato-Balsamic Pan Sauce\n--------------------------------------\n\nFennel seeds give this tomato and balsamic sauce an extra kick, but if you don't have them on hand, try using cumin or coriander seeds, or 1 teaspoon of a ground herb or spice. Serve this easy chicken breast recipe with whole-wheat spaghetti or crusty bread to sop up the sauce.\n\nSpinach & Egg Scramble with Raspberries\n---------------------------------------\n\nJen Causey\n\nThis quick egg scramble with hearty bread is one of the best breakfasts for weight loss. It combines protein-packed eggs and superfood raspberries with filling whole-grain toast and nutrient-rich spinach. The protein and fiber help fill you up and keep you going through the morning.\n\nOne-Pot Tomato Basil Pasta\n--------------------------\n\nThis one-pot pasta with tangy tomato-basil sauce is a simple, fast and easy weeknight dinner. All of your ingredients go into one pot, and with a bit of stirring and about 25 minutes of cook time, you'll have a healthy dinner the whole family will enjoy.\n\nSlow-Cooker Chicken & Chickpea Soup\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe only things better than healthy dinner ideas are easy healthy dinner ideas.

Stuffed pumpkins like this are basically like a healthier versions of a bread bowl (one of my personal favorite indulgences). The filling in the pumpkin bowls, with a mix of Gruyère cheese, stale bread, sautéed vegetables and ground turkey, is like a savory bread pudding.\n\nAs you eat the stuffed pumpkins, scrape the sweet flesh from the sides of the roasted pumpkin shell and devour each bite of the filling for an all-in-one twist on thanksgiving dinner. This version of Thanksgiving food is perfect for smaller holiday gatherings where roasting a whole turkey may not make sense. You still get all the holiday flavors in this dish throughout the stuffed pumpkin recipe without the day-long prep.\n\nGround Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffed Pumpkins\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n### Table of contents\n\n*   [Ground Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffing Filled Roasted Mini Pumpkins](#h-ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins)\n    *   [Key Ingredients in This Recipe](#h-key-ingredients-in-this-recipe)\n    *   [How to Make Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffing Filled Roast Pumpkins](#h-how-to-make-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roast-pumpkins)\n    *   [Tips and Tricks for This Recipe](#h-tips-and-tricks-for-this-recipe)\n    *   [Other Recipes to Try](#h-other-recipes-to-try)\n\n[![small sugar pie pumpkin baguette celery sage and yellow onions](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_6039524d4b1cf.jpg)](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/2017-ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins/ground-turkey-brown-butter-sage-stuffing-filled-roasted-mini-pumpkins-ingredients-shot/)\n\n### Key Ingredients in This Recipe\n\n*   **Pumpkin –** “Sugar”, “sugar pie” or “pie pumpkins” are the best types of pumpkins to use for baking. Larger varieties used for carving often have a much tougher texture and lack the sweetness of the smaller pumpkins. It acts as both the vessel and additional vegetables.\n*   **Turkey –** Ground turkey is typically made from both light and dark meat. The ground turkey in this stuffed pumpkin recipe can be swapped with ground chicken or pork though it’s not as seasonal.\n*   **Mirepoix –** A combination of carrots, celery and onion are sautéed to create the flavorful base of stuffing. This combination is referred to as sofrito in Italian and is often called a mirepoix in French cooking.\n*   **Sage –** The chopped fresh sage leaves are fried in butter to add a nutty and more complex flavor to the filling.\n*   **Gruyère cheese** – Gruyère is a hard cheese with a nutty, sweet flavor from Switzerland. The fact that it melts well (due to a high water to oil ratio) mixed with t’s distinct flavor makes it the perfect addition to anything from sandwiches to mac and cheese or fondue. If you can’t find Gruyère, I recommend substituting with another Swiss cheese like Emmental.\n\n### How to Make Turkey & Brown Butter Sage Stuffed Pumpkins\n\n![cut open sugar pie pumpkins with seeds scooped out](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-4-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 1: Cut pumpkins.\n\nPreheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Turn each pumpkin on its side, and use a sharp knife to slice the top, including the stem, off the pumpkin, about 1-inch down. Use a spoon to remove the seeds and discard or reserve for another use.\n\n##### Step 2: Roast pumpkins. \n\nRub the inside of the pumpkins with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper then arrange the pumpkins and cut off tops on a baking sheet. Roast until the meat is soft, about 35 minutes.

Add the carrots, onion and celery and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes.\n\n##### Step 4: Cook the turkey. \n\nAdd the ground turkey to the pan and sauté, stirring occasionally and using a wooden spoon to break up any large pieces, until the meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper then remove the turkey mixture to a large mixing bowl and toss with the bread.\n\n![sautéed vegetables and ground turkey](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-13-683x1024.webp)\n\n![fried chopped sage in brown butter ](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-15-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 5: Make sage butter. \n\nLower the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).Return the pan to medium-low heat, add the butter and allow to melt. Add the sage to the pan and cook until the butter is nutty and fragrant, about 4 minutes.\n\n##### Step 6: Combine filling. \n\nAdd the sage butter to the turkey mixture. Pour the chicken stock over top, tossing to combine until all the bread is moistened then add 1 cup of the Gruyère cheese and toss to combine.\n\n![ground turkey and vegetable filling with gruyere and cubed stale baguette](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-16-683x1024.webp)\n\n![filled roasted mini pumpkins with the stuffing mixture topped with gruyere cheese](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ground-Turkey-and-Brown-Butter-Stuffed-Pumpkins-22-683x1024.webp)\n\n##### Step 7: Stuff pumpkins and bake. \n\nFill the roasted pumpkins with the stuffing mixture until packed and almost overflowing.

This recipe combines sweet, spicy, and smoky flavors to create a seriously flavorful chicken bowl! The chipotle chicken marinade is quick and easy to make and goes beautifully with the sweet corn salsa and buttery avocados.\n\n![honey chipotle chicken bowls with brown rice, avocados, and corn salsa](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-1-710x1065.jpg)\n\nThat is some serious flavor right there!\n\nWe’re talking about chicken marinated in a honey chipotle mixture that’s slightly sweet, smoky, with a hint of spice, and nothing short of flavorful. It also happens to be one of the best things you can meal prep because it tastes better as it sits.\n\nWe’ll start by marinating the chicken and letting it hang out. This recipe is perfect to make on an outdoor grill in the summertime and equally delicious made on an indoor grill pan when you’re living in a tundra in the middle of winter. The marinade for this recipe is inspired by Chipotle’s vinaigrette recipe. We’ve just played around with the quantities to create a marinade rather than a dressing.\n\nThe sweet corn salsa is also inspired by Chipotle’s corn, which is totally a fiesta in your mouth. I start charring off a poblano pepper – totally optional. I know some people don’t mind the skin, but if I’m going to make this thing, I’m going to do it right. And then, we add in a squeeze of lemon juice, lime juice, a minced jalapeño, and lots of red onions. You can scoop it up with a tortilla chip, or you can serve it on top of this bowl; either way – it’s fantastic.\n\nServe it all up on a bed of your favorite rice, quinoa, or grains with slices of buttery avocados. And if you’re about to ask, doesn’t it need a sauce? You could totally do one, but honestly, it’s so flavorful that nope, we actually didn’t need one!\n\nA flavor explosion is coming at you in 3..2…1\n\n![honey chipotle diced chicken over rice](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-3-710x1065.jpg)\n\nIngredients for honey chipotle chicken bowls\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Chicken:** I used boneless skinless chicken thighs for this recipe because that’s what I had on hand. But usually, I prefer to use chicken breasts for my bowls. Needless to say, thighs, breasts, and tenders – any protein cut works for this bowl.\n*   **Chipotle Peppers:** I use a can of chipotles that are packed in adobo sauce. You’ll need 1-2 peppers for this recipe, depending on how much heat you want the recipe to have. We usually veer on the side of caution and go with one chipotle pepper, and it’s perfect that way. You’ll also want 1 tablespoons adobo sauce.\n*   **Olive oil:** You’ll need a bit of olive oil to add to the marinade. Since the marinade contains plenty of oil, I usually don’t spray my grill pan before cooking the chicken.\n*   **Red Wine Vinegar:** Goes into the chipotle marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Honey:** Adds a hint of sweetness to the marinade.\n*   **Seasonings:** You’ll need onion powder, oregano, salt, and peppers. Most of these will go into the marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Corn:** I like to use a bag of frozen corn that I’ll just zap in the microwave. Fresh corn that you char on the grill would be a dream if you’re making this during the summer. It’s one of my favorite additons to this [salad](https://littlespicejar.com/charred-corn-avocado-salad/).\n*   **Onions and Garlic:** Red onions go into the corn salsa, and the garlic is for the marinade for the chicken.\n*   **Peppers and cilantro:** I use a couple of different kinds of peppers. You’ll need a small poblano pepper and a jalapeño pepper. I usually remove all the ribs and seeds from the jalapeño before mincing it up. You’ll also want to char your poblano and remove the skin. This is optional, but I do think it gives the salsa a smokey, delicious flavor! You’ll also need a handful of cilantro to add to the corn salsa.\n*   **Lemon and Limes:** You’ll need both lemons and limes to add to the corn salsa.\n*   **Base and Toppings:** You’ll need cooked rice, quinoa, or your favorite grains to make the bowl. You’ll also need ripe avocados that are diced or sliced. I used regular fluffed brown rice, but you could also make this with [cilantro lime rice](https://littlespicejar.com/cilantro-lime-rice/) or [Mexican rice](https://littlespicejar.com/mexican-rice/) for more flavor!\n\n![chicken in marinade and grilled chicken](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-2-710x532.jpg)\n\n![corn salsa in bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\nHow to make honey chipotle chicken bowls\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Start with the marinade.** Add the minced chipotle peppers, adobo, vinegar, honey, oil, garlic, onion powder, oregano, salt, and pepper to a jar and shake or whisk it to combine. Pour the marinade over the chicken and let sit for at little as 30 minutes and, ideally, around 4 hours.\n2.  **Char the peppers.** While the chicken is marinating, you’ll want to cook the rice or grains; you’ll also want to char the peppers and prepare the corn salsa. Place the poblano over an open flame on the stove and keep a close eye on it. You’ll hear the pepper start to pop. The heat blisters the skin, chars, and loosens it. Keep cooking until charred all over. Then place it in a bowl and cover with a lid for 10 minutes before you peel it with a spoon. Then mince the pepper.\n3.  **Make corn salsa.** Add the defrosted corn, minced poblano, jalapeño, cilantro, red onions, lemon, and lime juice to a bowl. Stir to combine and season with a pinch of salt. Cover and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve the bowls.\n4.  **Cook the chicken.** Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook them for 8-10 minutes, flipping the chicken in the skillet around the halfway mark. When the chicken is done, remove it to a cutting board and let it rest for several minutes before you slice or dice it.\n5.  **Assemble and serve.** Serve up the fluffy rice, tender quinoa, or grains in a bowl topped with diced chicken, a scoop of corn salsa, and slices of avocado. And feel free to top it with chopped tomatoes, hot sauce, [pickled onions](https://littlespicejar.com/quick-pickled-onions/), or other fresh veggies!\n\n![chipotle chicken, rice avocados and corn salsa in bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-8-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### FAQs about this recipe\n\n****Are honey chipotle chicken bowls a good recipe for meal prep?**​**\n\nYes! The chicken is uber-flavorful and will easily last in the refrigerator for 4 days. I recommend placing the chicken and rice in [containers](https://amzn.to/3vFwJA6) and keeping the corn salsa separate. Add the corn salsa and the avocado to each bowl right before serving.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Honey Harissa Chicken Bowls](https://littlespicejar.com/honey-harissa-chicken-bowls/)\n*   [Steak Fajita Bowls with Garlic Lime Rice](https://littlespicejar.com/steak-fajita-bowls/)\n*   [​Beef Birria de Res](https://littlespicejar.com/birria-de-res/)\n*   [Mexican Street Corn Chicken Tacos](https://littlespicejar.com/mexican-street-corn-chicken-tacos/)\n*   [Creamy Mexican Corn Dip](https://littlespicejar.com/creamy-mexican-corn-dip-elotes-dip/)\n\n![hand holding bowl with chicken and toppings](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-9-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![honey chipotle chicken bowls with brown rice, avocados, and corn salsa](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Bowls-1-735x1103.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Bowls:\n\n*   1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken (thighs/breasts/tenders)\n*   1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (plus 1 tbsp adobo)\n*   1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar\n*   1 tablespoon honey\n*   3 tablespoons olive oil\n*   2 small garlic cloves, minced\n*   ½ teaspoon EACH: onion powder AND dried oregano\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   ¼ teaspoon pepper\n*   2 ½ cups prepared rice, quinoa, or grains\n*   Lime wedges and cilantro, for serving\n*   Slices avocados, for serving\n\n#### Corn Salsa:\n\n*   1 (16-ounce) bag frozen corn\n*   ⅓ cup red onion, finely chopped\n*   1 large poblano pepper, charred, peeled and finely chopped\n*   1 jalapeño pepper, finely minced\n*   ¼ cup cilantro, chopped\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon juice AND lime juice\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **COMBINE:** Mince the chipotle peppers finely and add to a mason jar.

With plenty of mini pumpkins already on hand, I thought about what delicious combination of flavors to stuff inside them. Sausage, sweet onion, mushrooms, pecans, cranberries, kale, Parmigiano-Reggiano, seasonal spices, and of course, rice came together for a flavor combination that’s quintessentially fall.\n\n![Sausage, Rice, and Cranberry Mini Stuffed Pumpkins | inspiredbycharm.com](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rice-Sausage-Cranberry-Stuffed-Mini-Pumpkins-681x1024.jpg)\n\nNow stuff all of that goodness into a mini pumpkin, and what’s not to love?\n\nWhile combining all of these flavors is bound to be delicious, this dish also wins on presentation.

With sweetness from the cranberries, crunch from the pecans, green color from the kale, and seasonal spices such as thyme and nutmeg, it’s the perfect savory complement to an autumn meal.\n\n![Sausage, Rice, and Cranberry Mini Stuffed Pumpkins | inspiredbycharm.com](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sausage-and-Rice-Stuffed-Mini-Pumpkin-Recipe-697x1024.jpg)\n\n![Sausage, Rice, and Cranberry Mini Stuffed Pumpkins | inspiredbycharm.com](https://inspiredbycharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fall-pumpkin-side-dish-1024x661.jpg)\n\nAnd don’t forget the pumpkin; you can eat that too.

Try this parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower! It’s got lots of flavor from the pesto and a nice salty bite from the parmesan cheese. Plus, you only need four ingredients to make it!_\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a plate with a bowl of pesto.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-photos.jpg)\n\n_This recipe and photos have been updated since the original post on 2/22/2017_\n\nThere’s about a 50/50 chance you’ll get a side dish with dinner at our house. If we have company there’s a good chance you’ll get one, but if it’s just me and my husband not so much. \n\nI have been trying to be better about it. My go-to side dish is generally some kind of roasted vegetable, like these [chili honey lime roasted brussels sprouts](https://reciperunner.com/chili-honey-lime-roasted-brussels-sprouts/) or this [sweet and spicy roasted butternut squash](https://reciperunner.com/sweet-spicy-roasted-butternut-squash/).\n\nWhatever side dish I’m making it has to be easy and something that will taste good the next day so I can repurpose it with another meal. This parmesan pesto roasted cauliflower checks both of those boxes and the flavor is next level!\n\n ![ingredients for Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-ingredients-photo.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients For Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Cauliflower\n*   Pesto\n*   Parmesan cheese\n*   Lemon\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower with a bowl of pesto with a spoon in it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-photographs.jpg)\n\nThis side dish couldn’t be easier to make. Start by preheating your oven to 400° F. Rinse and dry the head of cauliflower and then cut out the core. Break it down into florets and put them on a rimmed sheet pan.\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with any cleanup, line your sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Lay the cauliflower florets onto the sheet pan. \n\nDollop on 3 or 4 tablespoons of pesto depending on how large your head of cauliflower was. Sprinkle with salt and pepper as well. \n\nUse clean hands to toss the cauliflower until all the florets are coated with pesto. Spread them out into a single layer and make sure there is some space in between them. This will allow them to brown and caramelize rather than steam.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a sheet pan](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-process-photo.jpg)\n\nRoast the pesto cauliflower for 10 minutes and then remove it from the oven. Use a spatula to toss it around and then sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Roast for another another 12-15 minutes or until it’s tender and caramelized.\n\nRemove it from the oven and squeeze the juice of half of a lemon all over it. Put it on a serving platter or in a bowl. I like to scrape up any of the crispy parmesan cheese that’s stuck to the pan and add it in. \n\nDollop on additional pesto and sprinkle on extra parmesan cheese if you’d like. \n\n ![spoon drizzling pesto on top of Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/parmesan-pesto-roasted-cauliflower-picture.jpg)\n\n**Tips For Roasting Cauliflower**\n---------------------------------\n\n*   Roast the cauliflower at a high heat. I like to roast mine at 400° F., but you can also roast at 425° F. Just keep an eye on it as it likely won’t take as long to roast.\n*   Slice the cauliflower so that there are plenty of flat edges. Make sure the flat edges are in contact with the bottom of the pan. This will ensure that they get golden brown and caramelized on that side.\n*   Don’t overcrowd the pan. If the cauliflower is too close together or on top of each other it will steam and won’t get any of the crisp edges or caramelization.\n*   Be sure the cauliflower is completely coated in oil or in this case pesto. Pesto contains olive oil which is why I didn’t add any additional oil to this recipe. \n*   Flip the florets over with a spatula halfway through the cooking time. This will help to caramelize more surface area of the florets.\n\n ![Parmesan Pesto Roasted Cauliflower on a gray plate with a bowl of pesto.

    "markdown": "# Strawberry Salad - Strawberry Crunch Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette\nSay hello to the most delicious summery strawberry salad!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-9.jpg)\n\nThis strawberry crunch salad is going to be theeeee most made salad in my kitchen this year. I think. I mean, I have a lot of salads that I love, and even more coming to you this season. But if you’re a strawberry freak like I am, you will adorrrrreee this bowl. \n\nIt’s fresh, savory, creamy and crunchy. Ideal for what I require in a salad!\n\n![strawberries](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/strawberry-trifle-10.jpg)\n\nRemember [my blueberry (crunch) salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) that I shared last year? It was such a huge hit all summer and I knew I had to make a strawberry salad version. Where that one is a bit simpler, this one has more substance and could totally be a lunch salad because it’s incredibly satisfying.\n\nOn the same note, it’s still a salad that you could serve as a starter to dinner. It definitely works! \n\n![strawberry crunch salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-3.jpg)\n\nIf I’ve rambled about anything (everything?) on this blog, it’s that I.love.texture. Not even that I love texture, but I NEED texture. Especially in my salads. I can’t tell you how often I google “crunchy things for salads” when throwing together a house salad for dinner. It’s imperative for my mental and emotional and physical eating state.\n\n### Very important, clearly.\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-7.jpg)\n\nSo because of that, I like to use two varieties of nuts here. First, we’re making the sugared almonds from [the blueberry salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) because they are so fantastic. I highly suggest you don’t leave these out. They MAKE the dish. And they are easy too. You have to keep an eye on them but you can also prep them ahead of time. You can see me make them on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/howsweeteats/) today!\n\nThen on the flip side, I like to use roasted, salted pistachios. A sweet nut and a savory nut. Pistachios are one of my favorites – so buttery and rich. Having both nuts in the salad adds such a wonderful layer of crunch and flavor.\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-14.jpg)\n\nNext, the creamy avocado and goat cheese! I love using both of these too – the avocado is mild and the goat cheese is tangy. You can also sub in feta or leave out the cheese entirely if you don’t like goat. \n\nI love how the goat cheese melts into the whole salad when it’s tossed. It’s always my favorite part of goat cheese in a salad!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-15.jpg)\n\n### Finally, the strawberries!\n\nLeave them in halves or quarter them – or chop. Whatever you wish. I love that we are entering full blown strawberry season where they taste like actual candy. I’m also wondering how old that makes me sound, because when adults used to tell me that strawberries taste like candy when I was a kid, I’d look at them like they had ten heads.\n\nOf course, I’ve said this to Max and Emilia recently and while strawberries probably rank as one of their favorite foods, they do NOT think they are candy. Ha.\n\nI love to use a champagne vinaigrette on this salad because it’s still tangy and briney, but mild at the same time. It’s not quite as strong as red wine or apple cider vinegar. It adds a nice savory contrast to the salad, but still lets the other ingredients shine. The best dressing, in my opinion! Of course, feel free to use another one that you love here. The [creamy balsamic from my blueberry salad](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/06/blueberry-summer-salad/) would also be incredible. \n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-11.jpg)\n\nCan’t get enough of this beauty!\n\n![strawberry crunch salad with champagne vinaigrette](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-5.jpg)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStrawberry Saladwith Champagne Vinaigrette\n------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://www.howsweeteats.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/strawberry-crunch-salad-9-250x250.jpg)\n\nStrawberry Crunch Salad\n-----------------------\n\nYield: 4 people\n\nPrep Time: 25 minutes\n\nCook Time: 5 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 30 minutes\n\nThis strawberry salad is the best spring and summer meal! Super crunchy and textured with avocado and goat cheese. Absolutely delicious.\n\n#### salad\n\n*   ⅔ cup sliced or slivered almonds\n*   3 tablespoons [sugar](https://www.target.com/p/granulated-sugar-4lbs-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-78471310?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab)\n*   10 ounces arugula greens\n*   8 ounces [strawberries,](https://www.target.com/p/organic-strawberries-16oz/-/A-85762475?aflt=plt) hulled and quartered or chopped\n*   1 [avocado](https://www.target.com/p/hass-avocados-4ct-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-81957708?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab) chopped\n*   2 ounces crumbled goat cheese,\n*   ⅓ cup roasted salted pistachios, chopped\n\n*   Place the almonds in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and cook, stirring often, until the sugar melts and is caramely, coating all of the almonds - about 6 to 8 minutes. Don’t take your eyes off of this as they can burn quickly! Transfer the almonds to a piece of parchment paper to let them cool. Break them into pieces if they are clumped.\n    \n*   Toss the arugula with a pinch of salt and pepper in a large bowl.

    "markdown": "# Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - Homemade Home\n_**Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute** is a gorgeous and super simple appetizer for a get-together. This baked brie recipe is made in puff pastry and baked! You can bet this won’t go unnoticed!_\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-2-e1638987884244.jpg)\n\nWell, _none_ of this week’s “How Big Is The Kid?!” baking experiment is unfortunate. It’s cheese wrapped in carbs. And then baked until molten and golden brown.\n\nPraise the sugar gods for keeping my numbers in cheese, because I admit that I ate about half of this wheel of cheese while shooting it. Huck, the dog, also got his fair share when I wasn’t looking…\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-3-e1638987896658.jpg)\n\nLike mother like son. And the human son was also quite pleased with how this turned out, if his kicks to my lungs were any indication.\n\nAccording to my pregnancy app (I use Ovia Pregnancy for anyone curious), they say at 30 weeks he was the size of a brie en croute.\n\nI can only assume that they meant a much larger wheel of brie than the mini 8 ounce version I baked up for this – but let’s be honest, I probably didn’t need a full one pound wheel baked in puff pastry just laying around the house… Need is different than want.\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-4-e1638987905677.jpg)\n\nI sure as hell WANTED a full wheel just laying around the house. But such is life.  \n\nSummer is in full swing in Seattle – with over 40 days of NO RAIN. Two good things are coming out of that, one being that my tomatoes are absolutely thriving, and two that our blackberries are finally getting the clue that it is time to ripen.\n\nAnd they are really taking that clue seriously.\n\nOur little street is packed with berries, some ripe and ready to pick, and others still green so I will have a good rotation of berries to pick the rest of summer.\n\nHuck is a champion blackberry picker and gets his own low hanging berries right from the prickly vines. In 20 minutes we cleaned house, picking some of the most delicious, warm blackberries for this recipe (and a pie I promised Ben). Only one brush with stinging nettles stymied me – which is a victory in itself since I was out there in shorts and a tank top ambling through the brambles. \\*Slow clap\\*.\n\nWhat is this Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute recipe best served with?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI like to use crackers or bread crisps! Anything sturdy to scoop and eat!\n\nYou can serve baked brie with sturdy crackers, bread crisps, or as part of a fruit and veggie tray as well.\n\nCan I take the thyme out of this Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute recipe?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute - An EASY and stunning appetizer for any occasion!](https://homemadehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blackberry-Thyme-Baked-Brie-En-Croute-e1638987923603.jpg)\n\nThe thyme was a lovely savory component to the sweetness of the berries. And I 11/10 recommend. But if you want a sweet baked brie, you can omit it from this Blackberry Thyme Baked Brie En Croute and it is still divine.  \n\nNeed to catch up on our progress for this kiddo?

Everything gets tossed in a creamy maple tahini dressing and every bite is just magical. Here’s what you’ll need to make the salad:\n\n*   **Carrots:** you’ll start by grilling a few halved, large carrots so that they have those pretty grill marks. You’ll need some avocado or [olive oil](https://amzn.to/3nATNf7), salt and pepper.\n*   **Arugula:** the base of this salad is zippy, deliciously peppery arugula. It helps to balance all of the other mix-ins and the dressing.\n*   **Mix-ins:** we’re adding [dried fig halves](https://amzn.to/3yE6RqA) for sweetness, [walnut halves](https://amzn.to/3R21GId) for crunch, goat cheese for a little tang and savory flavor, and avocado for that amazing creaminess.\n*   **For the dressing:** tie the whole salad together with a dressing made with [tahini](https://amzn.to/3xJk6Ip), lemon juice, [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/3nygTD9), a little [dijon mustard](https://amzn.to/3ydAuNT), [garlic powder](https://amzn.to/3IeEWAM), salt & pepper.

Here’s what I can recommend:\n\n*   **Choose your mix-ins:** feel free to pick whatever mix-ins sound good to you like dried cranberries or dates, pecan halves, and feta cheese.\n*   **Add a boost of protein:** make the salad even more filling with 1/2 cup roasted chickpeas, grilled chicken or shrimp.\n*   **Pick your base:** I love the combo of carrots and arugula, but you could also grill sliced sweet potatoes and/or use a mixed green or spinach base.\n*   **Make it dairy free, vegan and/or paleo:** simply leave off the goat cheese! The salad will still be delicious.\n\n![drizzling a grilled carrot salad with tahini dressing](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Grilled-Carrot-Avocado-Fig-Arugula-Salad-2.jpg \"Beautiful grilled carrot arugula salad with sweet dried figs, tangy goat cheese, creamy avocado and crunchy walnuts.

Use tongs or clean hands to coat the carrots with the oil.\n    \n*   Preheat the grill to medium high heat (about 400 degrees F) and grill the carrots for 15-25 minutes total or until slightly tender, flipping halfway through. Please note, if you don’t want to grill your carrots, you can roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n    \n*   Toast walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n    \n*   While the carrots are cooking you can make your dressing: in a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, dijon, garlic powder, water (1 tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency) and salt and pepper. Set aside.\n    \n*   Add arugula to a large platter (or you can keep it in a large bowl) and then layer with the toppings: grilled carrots, dried fig halves, toasted walnuts, goat cheese crumbles, avocado slices, and roasted chickpeas (if using).\n    \n*   Drizzle tahini dressing all over the top and season with freshly ground salt and pepper. Divide into bowls and enjoy! Salad keeps well for 2-4 days. Serves 4 as a main and 6 as a side salad.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**To roast the carrots:** add the carrots to a [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3yG7xM9) lined with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/3ukfbZK) and roast them at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until tender.\n\nIf you’re not into a tahini dressing, I suggest my simple light maple apple cider vinaigrette for this salad. You can toss it with the arugula first or simply place it on the side and have guests drizzle over their salad before serving: 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey and freshly ground salt and pepper to taste.\n\nSee the full post for delicious & easy ways to customize your salad!\n\n### Nutrition\n\nServing: 1serving (based on 4)Calories: 421calCarbohydrates: 32.8gProtein: 11.7gFat: 28.7gSaturated Fat: 6gFiber: 5.9gSugar: 20.5g\n\nRecipe by: Monique Volz // Ambitious Kitchen | Photography by: [Eat Love Eats](https://eatloveeats.com/)\n\n_This post was originally published on July 5th, 2022, and republished on March 13th, 2024._"

Temp in the 60's and sunshiny every day? Right. Absoltely no complaints here that the chilly, rainy days are back and Spring is on hiatus. Honestly, couldn't be happier.\n\n![Bell Pepper Avocado Tomato](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bell-pepper-avocado-tomato.jpg)![Romaine and Baby Spring Mix](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/romaine-and-baby-spring-mix.jpg)\n\nHowever, this salad is a reminder of more warm and sunny days to come. What better way to say hello to the sun than with a southwestern style chipotle salad? And with easy, homemade tortilla strips? (the BEST part I might add).\n\n![Southwestern Salad Mix](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/southwestern-salad-mix.jpg)\n\n![Southwest Chipotle Salad Close Up](https://www.aberdeenskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/southwest-chipotle-salad-close-up.jpg)\n\nQuick, delicious, and refreshing after months of root veggies and stews! Fresh spring lettuces, black beans, yellow corn, ripe grape tomatoes, bright bell peppers, chunks of creamy avocado, topped with cilantro, queso fresco, those crunchy tortilla strips and drizzled with chipotle dressing?

The tortilla strips are SO GOOD! I find myself munching on them while I toss the rest of the ingredients together.

    "markdown": "# Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps. - Half Baked Harvest\nThis post may contain affiliate links, please see our [privacy policy](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/privacy-policy/) for details.\n\nThis Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wrap is the perfect wrap to enjoy for lunch or dinner. Grilled chicken wrapped up with Caesar salad tossed greens, avocado, bacon, and basil pesto. This colorful grilled chicken wrap is simple to make, wholesome, and delicious. Use leftover grilled chicken or make my spicy black pepper chicken on the grill. The wraps are great either way and yummy served warmed or chilled.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-1.jpg)\n\nCan you believe this is basically the first wrap recipe I’ve ever shared? I’ve avoided things like wraps and burritos for the longest time. And for the silliest reason…they’re hard for me to photograph. I know, how dumb, but we all have our hang-ups in life.\n\nBut I’m moving beyond and embracing wraps this summer. They feel new and exciting to me and that’s just what I need. New, fun, and exciting.\n\nI made these the very last day before heading off to LA the other week. I wasn’t planning on being able to get these done in time. But I really wanted to try so that I’d be able to share them ahead of Memorial Day weekend. And I am so glad I did! They’re perfect for using up any leftover chicken or for grilling up on Memorial Day.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-2.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients for the wraps\n\n*   4 large tortillas or gluten free tortillas\n*   grilled chicken or rotisserie chicken\n*   shredded lettuce or spinach\n*   sliced or diced avocado\n*   fresh basil (consider an herb garden on your front steps or side yard for fresh herbs year round)\n*   basil pesto\n*   cooked bacon\n*   crumbled blue cheese or shredded cheddar\n*   (If you want to add more to your wrap, red onion, cucumbers, and tomatoes would be delicious)\n\n### Here are the quick details\n\nThe recipe calls for already cooked chicken. You can use whatever you have on hand. Or make the black pepper chicken I often grill during the warm weather months.\n\nIt’s simply chicken tenders, tossed with olive oil, either cajun seasoning or fajita seasoning, and black pepper. Literally just three ingredients, but this mix is a go-to for me. I gave you the recipe in the notes section, so you can use that, or as I said, use leftover chicken.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-3.jpg)\n\nThe reason I really wanted to make these? I wanted another recipe to use [my homemade tortillas](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/homemade-flour-tortillas/) with. If you guys haven’t made these yet, please make them soon! They are far superior to anything you might find at the store.\n\nVery soft, but with deliciously charred pockets and so much flavor. They’re perfect for this style of wrap because you can really taste the tortillas.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-4.jpg)\n\n### The salad\n\nFor the salad, I made a short-cut Caesar dressing and tossed it with some shredded romaine lettuce, cubed avocado, and fresh basil.\n\nThe dressing is obviously key, it adds creaminess plus flavor to each wrap.\n\nWhen you have the salad tossed, all that’s left is to roll the wraps. As I mentioned, I used my homemade tortillas, then layered on some basil pesto, the Caesar salad, grilled chicken, bacon, and some blue cheese. If you don’t enjoy blue cheese, you can use shredded cheddar or even just crumbled feta.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-5.jpg)\n\nThen, wrap and roll burrito style.\n\nSince I used fresh grilled chicken and warm tortillas off the skillet, I didn’t feel the need to warm my wraps. But if you like, you can cook them in a skillet with a little olive oil until warmed. Or serve them chilled – either way is honestly so delicious.\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-6.jpg)\n\nThese would be really nice for your Memorial Day picnics…and any other summer outings to follow.\n\nI know Creighton wishes he had his own wrap will sitting here by the pool!\n\n![Pesto Chicken and Avocado Bacon Salad Wraps | halfbakedharvest.com](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pesto-Chicken-and-Avocado-Bacon-Salad-Wraps-7.jpg)\n\n_Looking for other picnic-style sandwich recipes?

Looking through the photos of recipes you all have made is my favorite!\n\n**What does basil pesto consist of?**\n\nTraditional pesto is a blend of fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, extra-virgin olive oil, and Parmesan cheese (you can hold on the cheese for a vegan variety). Use a food processor to easily mix up your pesto! It was traditionally made by mixing the ingredients with a mortar and pestle.\n\n**Is pesto healthy?**\n\nYes! All of the ingredients in pesto have health benefits and the fat source is considered unsaturated.\n\n**Where did pesto originate?**\n\nThe bright green, herby sauce originated in Genoa, Italy.\n\n**How else can I use pesto?**\n\nAdd a dollop of pesto to pasta, spread on sandwich bread, or add to poultry and vegetables. It’s a versatile spread that is delicious when used a number of ways!\n\nPrep Time 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time 20 minutes\n\nServings: 4 wraps\n\nCalories Per Serving: 792 kcal\n\nNutritional information is only an estimate.

I mean, who doesn’t love throwing everything into a pot that cooks itself? SIGN ME UP.\n\nA solid slow cooker recipe is what all of us need in our hip pockets. Especially one that is as crazy tasty as this!\n\nSo why do you need this Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl? Let me count the ways…\n\n*   Oh so easy! Let the slow cooker do ALL the hard work\n*   Great flavors – chicken is cooked in tomatoes, jalapeño, cilantro, lime…not lacking in the flavor department over here!\n*   Lots of textures – i.e. corn, beans, avocado, cilantro…\n*   So versatile – mix and match to create the Chicken Burrito Bowl of your dreams\n*   Leftovers! This recipe makes at least 6 servings (depending on how hungry you are) and will probably give you lunch and dinner for another day or two!\n\n![Bowl filled with chicken, corn, black beans, shredded cheese, avocados, cilantro and la wedge of lime](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-1.jpg)\n\nAnd yes, it tastes as dreamy as it looks….\n\nCooking chicken in slow cooker or crockpot\n------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, let’s talk about how to make the chicken. Think of this as a slow cooker (or some call it crockpot) chicken recipe inspired by yummy Mexican flavors, so you will find all the good stuff such as jalapeños, cumin, chili powder, and cilantro involved.\n\nThe best part is, with a crockpot and all the delicious spices/sauces we are adding, making the chicken flavorful, tender and delicious requires almost zero efforts.\n\nWell, maybe a little effort. 😉 As little as combining all the ingredients into the slow cooker.\n\nThese ingredients are:\n\n*   chicken – I used chicken breast, but chicken thighs work as well\n*   chicken broth\n*   salsa (I like to use chunky salsa, but pick your favorite!)\n*   smoked paprika\n*   cumin\n*   chili powder\n*   BRIANNAS Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nJust dump it all in the slow cooker, cover, and let it do its thing for 4 hours on high.\n\nI do want to pause and take a moment to reflect on how much I’m loving BRIANNAS salad dressings. I recently discovered that they are not just amazing salad dressings, they actually have multiple super powers.\n\n![Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing in the background](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-5.jpg)\n\nSuper power #1: makes salads taste amazing. But we know that already.\n\nSuper power #2: it’s an INCREDIBLE marinade. And works like magic in the crockpot!\n\nThat is right. Made out of quality ingredients, they make amazing marinades for your favorite protein. Like mind-blowing, over-the-fence, cannot-get-enough kind of incredible.\n\nHere’s the best part: you can search for BRIANNAS dressings near you [HERE](https://www.briannas.com/where-to-buy/) and join in the fun!\n\nThis Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing has yummy flavors of jalapeño, cilantro and lime in it, and it takes the flavors of our slow cooker chicken to the next level. In addition (because why stop there?), it also gives the sauce a slightly thicker, creamier texture.\n\nTranslation: I love this dressing; I love this Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl. Lots of love going around.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooked on high for 4 hours, shred it. You will find that the chicken will easily fall apart.\n\n![Shredding chicken in a crockpot using a pair of tongs](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-7.jpg)\n\nShredded Chicken in the crockpot\n\nNext, let the shredded chicken sit for about 10 minutes so it soaks in the yummy juices. Yum yum yum.\n\n**All the ways to serve Chicken Burrito Bowl!**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSomething else I love – the versatility of Chicken Burrito Bowl.\n\nServe the chicken with some (or all) of these yummy ingredients. Mix and match to your heart’s content. Make the Chicken Burrito Bowl of your dream.\n\nBest of all, these ingredients take little to no time to prepare:\n\n*   Rice – white or brown rice, or grab a box of Spanish rice or Mexican rice!\n*   Beans\n*   Corn\n*   Avocado\n*   Cheese\n*   Tortilla Chips\n*   Tomatoes\n*   Pico de Gallo\n*   My [Quick 15 Minutes Queso](https://www.joyousapron.com/easy-15-minute-queso-cheese-dip/)\n*   My [Homemade Guacamole](https://www.joyousapron.com/homemade-chunky-guacamole/)\n*   Jalapeños, if you like it spicy!\n\nSqueeze some lime juice onto the bowl, drizzle it with more BRIANNAS’ Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing.\n\nDIG IN and enjoy that lovely Chicken Burrito Bowl that you just tailor made for yourself!\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl with BRIANNAS dressing on the side](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-3.jpg)\n\nFlavorful, so much texture, pretty healthy, and so much going on in a simple bowl. I adore this delicious Chicken Burrito Bowl made in the slow cooker, and I have a suspicion that you would too!\n\nTips and Tricks\n---------------\n\nHere are some additional tips and tricks when making Chicken Burrito Bowl using the crockpot:\n\n*   When shredding the chicken, use a pair of tongs and fork to shred it. It should come apart really easily!\n*   Taste the chicken after you shred it, and if needed add salt to open up the flavors. I did not add salt, but whether salt is needed will depend on the chicken broth and/or salsa used.\n\n![A bowl of Slow Cooker Chicken Burrito Bowl](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Burrito-Bowl-Pic-4.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can you freeze Slow Cooker Chicken?**\n\nAbsolutely! Store in an airtight container in either the refrigerator or freezer. If you are storing it in the refrigerator, consume within 5 days. They store really well and make great leftovers and meal prep! Store ingredients separately and tailor make your Chicken Burrito Bowl when ready to eat!\n\n**How do I make the chicken in the Instant pot?**\n\nPressure cook on high for 15 minutes in the Instant Pot.\n\n**How do I make this low carb?**\n\nUse cauliflower rice instead of white or brown rice.\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS RECIPE?

    "markdown": "# Crockpot Chicken Fajitas + VIDEO - Fit Slow Cooker Queen\nThis **slow cooker chicken fajitas** recipe only has 5 ingredients: chicken, onions, bell peppers, diced tomatoes, and fajita seasoning. Quick and tasty, you can serve this healthy (low-carb, paleo, Whole30) fajita dish with your favorite accompaniments. Instructions to make this simple fajita recipe in the Instant Pot are also included. \n\n![side view shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-2.jpg)\n\nIngredients For Chicken Fajitas (ONLY 5)\n----------------------------------------\n\nThere are only 5 ingredients in the easy fajita recipe! \n\n1.  **Chicken:** Boneless, skinless breasts (or thighs).\n2.  **Fajita Seasoning:** My homemade fajita blend is included in the recipe box. If you have your own, feel free to use it. \n3.  **Bell Peppers:** 3 large bell peppers. I used green, red, and orange so it would be colorful. 3 bell peppers of the same color works just fine. \n4.  **Onions:** 1 large onion or 2 small onions. Don’t slice them too thin. \n5.  **Tomatoes:** 14.5-ounce can of diced tomatoes or your favorite salsa\n\n![collage of the chicken fajita ingredients](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-6.jpg)\n\nHow To Make Chicken Fajitas In The Crock-Pot\n--------------------------------------------\n\nMaking chicken fajitas is very easy, especially when you use your slow cooker (Crock-Pot) or pressure cooker (Instant Pot). \n\n[**Slow Cooker**](https://amzn.to/2OuNJ7r)\n\n1.  Season the chicken with salt & pepper. Add the chicken & all the other ingredients to the slow cooker. Stir to mix well.\n2.  Cook HIGH 2-3 hours or LOW 4-6.\n\n**[Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2OriB8u)** \n\n1.  Turn the Instant Pot to sauté. Once hot, add the oil, onion, and bell pepper and cook 3-5 minutes until soft.\n2.  Season the chicken with salt & pepper. Add the seasoned chicken, diced tomatoes, and all the other  seasonings to the pot. Stir to mix well. Close lid and seal valve. Set **high pressure** and cook **8 minutes**. When cooking time is complete, quick release pressure.\n\n![](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-10.jpg)\n\nbefore (slow cooker)\n\nChicken Breasts or Chicken Thighs?\n----------------------------------\n\nNormally my go-to cut of chicken when I use my slow cooker is chicken thighs. I used chicken breasts here. I prefer to use breasts in particular with fajitas. You can also make these with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. If you do, add an additional 30 minutes to an hour of cook time for the slow cooker and 1 minutes for the pressure cooker. You need to do this because dark meat takes longer to cook than white meat. Since this recipe uses chicken breasts, it’s not a recipe that can sit on the WARM setting. This will overcook the chicken and dry out the meat. When the food is done cooking, turn off the appliance. \n\n![](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-3.jpg)\n\nafter (slow cooker)\n\nHomemade Fajita Seasoning\n-------------------------\n\nIn the recipe box you will find my go-to homemade fajita seasoning. If you use it (which I hop you do) then technically this is recipe is more than 5 ingredients.  Hopefully you already have these spices in your pantry already. My fajita spice blend makes about 1/3 cup of seasonings. Personally, I make a big batch and keep it in my pantry.\n\n![overhead shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-4.jpg)\n\nHow To Serve The Fajitas\n------------------------\n\nTraditionally fajitas are served in corn or flour tortillas. I believe you should serve these fajitas according to your dietary restrictions. My go-to is lettuce wraps. Other suggestions are tortillas or over rice (regular, brown, or riced cauliflower). You can also use this as filling for burritos or even enchiladas. Popular garnishes for fajitas include cheese, guacamole, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, etc. \n\n![side view shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-7.jpg)\n\nFAQs & Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Store leftover fajitas in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. \n*   I used a [6-quart slow cooker](https://amzn.to/2O382Kj) or [Instant Pot.](https://amzn.to/2OzHIH6)\n\n**Mexican Inspired Recipes**\n----------------------------\n\n*   [**Steak Fajitas**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-steak-fajitas/)\n*   [**Salsa Verde Chicken**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken/)\n*   **[Cilantro-Lime Beef](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-carne-asada/)** \n*   **[Enchilada Tri-Tip](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/slow-cooker-mexican-tri-tip-paleo-whole30/)**\n*   [**Salsa Verde Beef**](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/video-slow-cooker-instant-pot-salsa-verde-beef-low-carb-paleo-whole30/)\n\n[Print](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/video-slow-cooker-instant-pot-chicken-fajitas-low-carb-paleo-whole30/print/11014/)\n\n![overhead shot of slow cooker chicken fajitas on a white plate garnished with cilantro, avocado, and limes](https://fitslowcookerqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Fajitas-VIDEO-8.jpg)\n\n*   2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips\n*   3 large bell peppers, sliced\n*   1 large onion or 2 small onions, sliced\n*   15 ounces diced tomatoes or salsa\n*   1/3 cup fajita seasonings (see below for homemade blend)\n*   Salt & pepper to season the chicken\n*   3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth (for Instant Pot only)\n\n**Homemade Fajita Seasoning**\n\n*   2 tablespoons chili powder\n*   1 tablespoon cumin\n*   1 1/2 teaspoons salt (or more)\n*   1 1/2 teaspoon oregano\n*   1 teaspoon paprika\n*   1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   1 teaspoon onion powder\n*   1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n[**Slow Cooker**](https://amzn.to/2OuNJ7r)\n\n1.

Just like my awesome [15-Minute Queso (Cheese Dip)](https://www.joyousapron.com/easy-15-minute-queso-cheese-dip/) recipe, which seem like a complete different food item, but in many ways it is not, chicken broth brings another dimension of flavor to the creamy sauce and elevates it.\n*   Creamy but not crazy heavy – this is a creamy and thick potato dish, but not so much that the cream overpower the potatoes. I like to think that the creaminess and cheese enhances the scalloped potatoes, and not overtake it completely.\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nHere is the full ingredient list to make cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n*   potatoes – My favorite potatoes to use for cheesy scalloped potatoes are Yukon gold potatoes, russets or Idaho. Basically middle to high starch potatoes are perfect for this.\n*   garlic – use fresh garlic because garlic powder is just not as flavorful if you really want the garlic flavors to come through.\n*   cheese – using three cheeses in this cheesy scalloped potatoes: mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan. You can opt for other cheeses as well.\n*   butter\n*   onion – sweet, yellow or white onions\n*   flour – used to thicken the sauce\n*   milk – i typically use 2% milk.\n*   chicken broth – important ingredient for another layer of flavor\n*   thyme – dried or fresh thyme works fine. Fresh will be more flavorful but it’s not necessary\n\n![A casserole of Cheesy Garlic Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-3.jpg)\n\nHow to make Garlic Scalloped Potatoes\n-------------------------------------\n\nNext, I’m going to show you how easy it is to make these cheesy scalloped potatoes!\n\n### Prepare Potatoes\n\nFirst, we are going to prepare the potatoes by slicing them into thin slices. Make sure they are nice and thin (~ 1/8 inch in thickness) so that they cook easily and soften quickly.\n\nHere are two reasons why it’s so easy to make garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n*   no boiling potatoes beforehand\n*   no peeling potatoes\n\nJust make sure you slice those potatoes super thinly and that’s all there is to it when it comes to preparing your potatoes.\n\n![Potatoes sliced thinly](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cheesy-scalloped-potatoes-683x1024.jpg)\n\n_Thinly sliced potatoes_\n\n### Prepare Cheese Sauce\n\nNext we make that delicious garlic cheese sauce, another essential part of our cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes. Gosh I love it so much.\n\nHeat a medium pot to medium heat and add butter.\n\nOnce butter is melted, add diced onions and minced garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until they are soft and fragrant.\n\nAdd flour and stir to combine. Once combined, add milk, chicken broth, thyme and salt. Whisk mixture continuously as it comes to a boil. It’s important to whisk it so that the flour clumps will dissolve.\n\nContinue stirring and cook for a few minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly.\n\nTurn off heat and add shredded cheddar, shredded mozzarella and parmesan. Stir to combine. \n\n![Making cheese sauce in a pot on stove](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cheesy-Scalloped-Potatoes-Process-Shots-1024x439.jpg)\n\nRemove from heat promptly and set aside.\n\nNext we will be layering the potatoes and cheese sauce to form a casserole dish full of cheesy scalloped potatoes.\n\n### Layer Casserole\n\nHere’s how we layer the cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes:\n\n1.  place 1/3 of the potatoes in [a 9″ x 13″ casserole dish](https://www.joyousapron.com/recommends/baking-dish-rectangular/ \"Baking Dish Rectangular\")\n2.  add 1/3 of the cheese sauce\n3.  repeat 1) and 2) until everything is gone.\n\n![Adding cheese sauce to potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-1.jpg)\n\nTip: As you layer the potatoes, make sure to spread them out and cover each of them well with sauce to ensure all your cheesy scalloped potatoes are fully cooked. Potatoes not covered with sauce are more difficult to cook through and will not be as soft.\n\n### Bake casserole\n\nOnce you have three layers of potatoes and cheese sauce, send your cheesy scalloped potatoes to the oven to bake!\n\nWhen cheesy scalloped potatoes are done, they should be bubbly with a slightly golden brown top. Potatoes should be soft and coated in that rich and creamy cheese sauce.\n\n![A rectangular casserole of Cheesy Garlic Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-2.jpg)\n\nCheese. Potatoes. Cheese. Potatoes.\n\nWith garlic flavored goodness all around it.\n\nMy heart is full. My stomach is full.\n\nThe cheese on the top will be slightly brown and crusty. Dig a spoon into it, and the creamy, velvety cheese will ooze out, along with the now tender and soft slices of potatoes.\n\nOkay YUUUUMMMM.\n\nThis lovely cheesy garlic scalloped potatoes makes the best side to any main dishes. If you truly must, it can also be consumed by itself.\n\nStorage and Reheat\n------------------\n\nCheesy garlic scalloped potatoes are the perfect dish to make ahead. Storage it covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\nTo reheat, simply cover and bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes at 350℉.\n\n![Scooping out some cheesy potatoes](https://www.joyousapron.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Cheesy-Garlic-Scalloped-Potatoes-Pic-5.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can I use other cheeses?**\n\nYes! Colby jack, Monterey jack, or any of your favorite blends work great! Make sure out of the cheeses you use, some of them melts easily (soft cheeses).\n\n**Can I freeze cooked scalloped potatoes?**\n\nYes! When ready to reheat, bring it to the refrigerator the night before so that it defrost completely. Then follow the reheating instructions to reheat.\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS RECIPE?

The long and slow cooking time makes all the flavors meld well. This is in addition to the rich combination of spices included in the marinade, make this dish irresistible.\n\nMy family and I discovered this dish while visiting India years ago, and we all loved it. Of course, I had to try and make it. And if I do say so myself, the results are even better than the one we tried! The trick to this recipe is the slow cooker. Letting it do all the work for you while you go on your day is awesome, and you get to return to a delicious meal at the end of the day!\n\nI start by marinating my chicken the night before. Just leave it in the fridge to soak up all the flavors. Then, before I leave for the day, I sauté it and put it in the slow cooker with the sauce to cook while I am out. If you need your chicken sooner, you can cook it on high for three to four hours. However, for the best flavor and most tender chicken, I recommend cooking on low for six to seven hours.\n\nWhy you will love this recipe\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **It is so easy:** Marinate the chicken the night before. Then sauté the chicken and toss it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients before enjoying your day. Then, you can come back to a delicious but easy meal.\n*   **Authentic flavor:** If your goal is to serve an authentic Indian meal, this one you should definitely try.\n*   **Leftovers taste incredible:** Some recipes taste better the next day. This crockpot butter chicken is one of them. Save some for lunch or dinner tomorrow.\n*   **Make it your way:** Although I prefer this dish just the way it is, sometimes I like to mix it up by adding or removing some of the ingredients. For example, when I have people sensitive to spicy foods, I leave out chili powder and garam masala.\n\n![a wooden spoon with creamy Indian butter chicken](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals3-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nWhat you’ll need to make slow cooker butter chicken\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Special items:\n\n*   **Slow cooker** – Whether you have a slow cooker or crockpot, the directions are the same.\n*   **Large skillet** – For sautéing the chicken. \n*   **Wooden spoon –** I prefer wooden utensils because they do not scratch the ceramic in my slow cooker.\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n*   **Chicken –** I use skinless boneless chicken thighs because they are easy to prepare, and my family prefers white meat. Whatever meat you use, just cut it into two-inch cubes.\n*   **Yogurt**—Plain Greek yogurt is my preference for this marinade. It adds a nice, mellow acid with a mild, creamy flavor.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Garlic powder**—I put garlic powder in just about everything, and it is perfect for marinating chicken because it is concentrated and will add more garlic taste.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Turmeric –** A popular curry spice, turmeric adds an earthy background with hints of pepper, ginger, and sweetness. Some say it tastes similar to mustard. It can also be somewhat bitter if you use too much.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red chili powder and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your marinade a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer to use sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n\n### For the sauce:\n\n*   **Olive oil –** I always use extra virgin olive oil because it is light and has a mild flavor**.** In this recipe, it is used to sauté the chicken.\n*   **Butter**—Because butter is the star of this dish, I only use the highest-quality butter without salt. If your butter has salt, remove it from the sauce ingredients.\n*   **Onion –** Minced and sauteed to add a fresh onion flavor without any bitterness that the powder has.\n*   **Garlic –** Also minced and sauteed, fresh garlic gives your sauce a deep, rich garlic taste.\n*   **Tomato sauce**—Another important ingredient. I prefer to use organic tomatoes to make my own, but you can use your favorite brand.\n*   **Evaporated milk –** Any kind of evaporated milk will do, but the better the quality, the better the flavor.\n*   **Heavy cream**—Do not substitute this ingredient unless you really have to because it gives your sauce the creaminess it needs to taste authentic.\n*   **Garam masala –** My favorite blend is mace, nutmeg, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Some blends also have mustard seeds, fennel, and bay leaves. Use what you like.\n*   **Ginger –** Freshly minced ginger is a bit spicy, but I prefer it to the powdered stuff for its bold flavor.\n*   **Cumin –** Although in the garam masala, I add a little extra for the warm, sweet flavor.\n*   **Red chili powder**—If you have never used it, the difference between red and regular chili powder is that the chiles are soaked in vinegar and water. Red chili powder adds an extra kick of tanginess to anything it touches.\n*   **Paprika –** Gives your sauce a subtly sweet and peppery taste. I like to use smoked paprika for its smoky flavor, but you can also use sweet or regular.\n*   **Salt**—I prefer sea salt because it is less processed than regular salt and has a fresher flavor.\n*   **Black pepper –** Grind your own from fresh peppercorns for the best taste.\n*   **Sugar –** I use granulated white sugar for sweetness, but you could use honey or maple syrup.\n\nHow to make slow cooker butter chicken?\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** The night before (or at least 30 minutes before), mix all of the marinade ingredients in a heavy-duty zipper baggie and add chicken. Put it in the fridge to marinate.\n2.  **Sauté the chicken:** When ready to begin, heat a large skillet with oil over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add chicken in batches so you don’t crowd the pan. Cook for about three to five minutes, or until it is brown on each side. Set it aside on a plate and cover with foil.\n3.  **Make the sauce:** Now, add the butter to the pan and let it melt before adding the garlic, onion, and ginger. Continue to stir and cook for two minutes. Add the paprika, sugar, red chili powder, garam masala, and cumin, and cook for another minute.\n4.  **Transfer to the pot:** Next, pour the sauce into your slow cooker and stir in the chicken. Add the evaporated milk and tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste.\n5.  **Cook the chicken:** Turn your pot to low and cook for six to seven hours or on high for three to four hours. About 30 minutes before the cooking time is up, stir in the heavy cream.\n6.  **Serve:** Finally, serve your butter chicken with whatever side dishes you like.\n\nExpert tip\n----------\n\n### Finding your own garam masala\n\nBecause there are many different garam masala blends, it is good to find your favorite before you cook with it. The most common variety is made with black peppercorns, green and black cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and mace. Some other types have fennel seeds, bay leaves, coriander, and chili powder. Others have only pepper, cloves, cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom.\n\nAll varieties and blends of garam masala are considered authentic Indian spices, so it is up to you to decide which mixture you prefer. Kosher garam masala has organic pepper, coriander, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom. Each spice, such as cardamom and fennel, can be ground into a powder or left as whole seeds or pods.\n\nBiryani masala is another variety of spices made with caraway seeds and anise. Another kind you may see on the market is chaat masala, which has dried mango powder added for a bit of sweet tanginess. You can also make your own, so you only get the spices you like and the right amounts.\n\n![slow cooker butter chicken served with rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals5-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nRecipe variations and add-ins:\n------------------------------\n\n*   **Different cuts:** Instead of skinless boneless chicken breast, you could also use thighs. Dark meat has a more robust flavor and is always juicy.\n*   **Different meat:** If your butcher does not have fresh organic chicken, you could use a different meat. I have tried pork, turkey. They are all truly delicious in their way.\n*   **Cheesy butter chicken:** Another way to change this recipe is to add some shredded cheese. I have tried cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan.\n*   **Make it spicy:** Even with the garam masala and chili powder, this dish is not that spicy. If you want to add some heat, add red pepper flakes to the marinade and toss chopped jalapenos into the sauce.\n\nServing suggestions:\n--------------------\n\nSlow-cooker butter chicken goes great with all sorts of side dishes. Here are some ideas my family loves:\n\n*   To make this a whole meal in one pot, add some baby red potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.\n*   I like to serve my saucy butter chicken on top of some [perfect fluffy rice](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/how-to-cook-perfect-rice-in-the-instant-pot/) and garlic naan on the side.\n*   Any kind of side dish would pair nicely with this dish, but for an Indian theme, try it with chutney, chana masala, naan, or [grilled eggplant](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-eggplant-recipe/).\n*   Add a light salad on the side, like this [strawberry broccoli salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/strawberry-broccoli-salad-recipe/) or [grilled zucchini salad](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/grilled-zucchini-salad-recipe/).\n*   To help soak that delicious sauce, serve with some crusty French bread or rolls like my [Amish potato dinner rolls](https://urls.grow.me/https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/amish-potato-dinner-rolls-recipe/%23growSource=search&growReferrer=true).\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Why is my slow cooker butter chicken watery?\n\nFirst, the most common reason for watery butter chicken is too much liquid. That may be the obvious thing, but many people overlook it. Keep an eye on your measuring to make sure the amounts are all correct. Another problem could be that you added the cream and butter too soon. Try waiting for the sauce to cool before adding them. Thicken up your sauce with a bit of cornstarch slurry.\n\n### How long do I cook chicken in a slow cooker?\n\nThe time to cook chicken in a slow cooker depends on the cut of meat and how large it is. If you are cooking a whole chicken, you may have to let it cook for six hours on low or up to nine hours on high. Chicken breasts can be finished in six or seven hours on low or three to four on high. Chopped chicken, like in this dish, can cook even faster, so make sure you check the internal temp early. Once it reaches 160 degrees F, you can shut off the crockpot, which will continue to cook, reaching 165 degrees F quickly.\n\n### How do I make my butter chicken tender?\n\nNo chicken should be chewy or rubbery, but it happens sometimes. It can happen if your chicken was not cooked long enough or when it is cooked too long. You have to get it to the correct temperature for eating, which is 165 degrees F, without going over that number. Using the marinade in this recipe should keep your chicken from drying out, especially since you are cooking it low and slow in a creamy sauce.\n\n### Why did my butter chicken sauce crack?\n\nGetting the sauce perfect can be difficult if you do not follow the directions carefully. If you overcook it after adding the butter, it will separate. If it simmers too long, the water can evaporate, and the sauce will dry and crack. Another thing to be careful of is to add the yogurt while it is not too hot, or it will curdle. The same goes for the cream. Do not mix the cream in until the last step so it will blend seamlessly. \n\n![crockpot butter chicken with a wooden spoon into the mixture](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals2-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\nHow to store:\n-------------\n\n*   **Refrigerate:** After cooled to room temperature, put your crockpot butter chicken in a sealed container. It will stay fresh for up to 10 days. \n*   **Freezing:** If you want to keep it longer, you must freeze it. Once it has cooled, pour it into a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, and it can stay frozen for four to six months. \n*   **Defrost:** Remove your frozen leftovers from the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you plan to serve them.\n*   **Reheating:** Heat in a saucepan on the stove for 10 minutes or in the microwave for one or two minutes. \n\nRecipe tips:\n------------\n\n*   To easily remove cardamom pods after cooking, use a needle and thread to tie them together. Then, before serving, lift the thread out to remove all the pods at once.\n*   If your chicken is too thin, add some cornstarch slurry and heat it a little longer. You can make a slurry by mixing one tablespoon of cornstarch with one cup of warm water.\n*   If it has an acid taste, add another tablespoon of sugar or honey.\n*   I usually double the sauce recipe because I like to use it when reheating. It also tastes great on tacos, pasta, and bread.\n*   When freezing, put your leftovers in small freezer-safe containers to take out just what you need when you need it.\n\nSlow Cooker Butter Chicken is made with tender, perfectly seasoned chicken and a rich curry sauce made with tomato and cream. This combination is nothing short of mouthwateringly delicious and so easy to make—the slow cooker does all the work. \n\n![image of slow cooker butter chicken](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/slow-cooker-butter-chicken-SweetAndSavoryMeals1-680x1020.jpg)\n\n[](https://sweetandsavorymeals.com/slow-cooker-butter-chicken/)\n\n### Chicken Marinade:\n\n*   ▢ 2 lbs chicken breasts or thighs cut into 2-inch cubes\n*   ▢ 1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon fresh minced ginger\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon garam masala\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon turmeric\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon of salt\n\n### Sauce:\n\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons butter\n*   ▢ 1 large onion diced\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic minced\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon ginger minced\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garam masala\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon paprika\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon sugar\n*   ▢ 14 oz tomato sauce\n*   ▢ 1 1/4 teaspoons salt or to taste\n*   ▢ 1 cup evaporated milk\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup heavy cream\n\n### Chicken Marinade:\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    In a bowl or large ziplock bag, combine chicken pieces with all of the MARINADE ingredients, cover with plastic wrap, and let marinate for 30 minutes or overnight in the fridge.\n    \n\n### Saute the Chicken:\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    Place a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Thankfully, Butternut Squash Risotto happens to be one of those dishes that I could eat for every meal and never grow tired of.\n\nRisotto in general is a dish that many associate with class and elegance.

First is the rice, Arborio rice. [Arborio rice](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/ingredient/arborio/) is an Italian short grain rice that is named after the town it hails from, Arborio, in the Po Valley. However, present day, it is grown all over, including in the United States.\n\nThe plump, short body makes it unique in its ability to soak up loads of liquid and release starches that result in the creaminess that so many people associate with risotto.\n\nIn fact, while many risotto recipes do contain cream or cheese, many do not and people are often baffled by the creaminess level.\n\n![Butternut Squash Risotto is an easy side dish or entrée made with Arborio rice, crisp white cooking wine, sweet roasted butternut squash and fresh thyme. #risottorecipes #butternutsquash www.savoryexperiments.com ](https://www.savoryexperiments.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Butternut-Squash-Risotto-7.jpg)\n\nThese unique little pods provide a blank slate for flavor, therefore being mindful of what liquid you add is crucial.\n\nTo give my risotto a rich and robust taste, I use Holland House White Cooking Wine.

    "markdown": "# Blueberry Peach Feta Salad - Recipe Runner\n[Jump to Recipe](#mv-creation-1013-jtr)\n\n_Blueberry Peach Feta Salad has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, and fresh flavors! Tossed in a lemon basil vinaigrette, it’s an easy and delicious salad to serve this summer!_\n\n![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad in a white serving bowl with two spoons and a bowl of the vinaigrette behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-pic-680x1018.jpg)\n\nIn the middle of summer it can be hard to find the motivation to cook, especially on a hot day. On days like those I gravitate towards using the grill to make my favorite [chipotle maple grilled salmon](https://reciperunner.com/chipotle-maple-grilled-salmon/) or [grilled pesto chicken skewers](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-pesto-chicken-skewers/).\n\nI always have to have some sort of refreshing salad to go with whatever I grill. During peach season, especially Colorado peach season, I love to make this Blueberry Peach Feta Salad. It’s sweet from the peaches and blueberries, a little salty from the feta and has a fresh crisp crunch from the Persian cucumbers.\n\nThe salad is tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette and is an absolute dream to eat on a hot summer day! It goes great with pretty much any grilled protein and is a wonderful side dish to bring to a barbecue.\n\n ![Ingredients used to make blueberry peach feta salad on a sheet pan.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-ingredients-photo-680x972.jpg)\n\nIngredients For Blueberry Peach Feta Salad\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   blueberries\n*   peaches\n*   Persian cucumbers or an English cucumber\n*   feta\n*   lemon\n*   dijon mustard\n*   honey\n*   fresh basil\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl. Serving spoons are next to the salad and a bowl of the vinaigrette is behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photo-680x967.jpg)\n\nHow To Make Blueberry Peach Feta Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nMaking this salad is as easy as making a simple everyday lettuce salad. Dice the peaches, slice the cucumbers, and add them to a serving bowl along with the blueberries.\n\nWhenever I make a recipe with feta, I prefer to use block feta and crumble it myself. I feel that the flavor is better, it isn’t as dry and it doesn’t have any of the anti-caking agent in it that pre-crumbled and pre-shredded cheeses contain. For this salad recipe you can crumble or cube the feta cheese.\n\n ![A gray bowl filled with lemon basil vinaigrette.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-picture-680x974.jpg)\n\nThe final step is to make the lemon vinaigrette. Combine the lemon juice, dijon, honey, olive oil, salt and pepper in a jar. Thinly slice the fresh basil, otherwise known as chiffonade and add it into the mix. Screw on the lid and shake it until it’s well combined. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad and gently toss everything together. You can eat the salad immediately or refrigerate it until you’re ready to serve.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photographs-680x1008.jpg)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**Can I make the salad vegan?**\n\nYes. Simply omit the feta and substitute the honey in the lemon vinaigrette with maple syrup. You can also add a can of chickpeas to the salad to make it heartier.\n\n**How long will the salad keep?**\n\nThe salad keeps for a couple days in the refrigerator. You will notice that the peaches will get softer and the feta will start to break down the longer it’s in the fridge, but it still taste great.\n\n**Can I make the salad ahead of time?**\n\nParts of the salad can be made ahead of time. You can cut the peaches and combine them with the cucumbers and blueberries a day ahead of time. The vinaigrette can be made several days ahead of time. I would wait until the day you plan to eat the salad to add in the fresh basil, feta and toss the salad in the vinaigrette.\n\n ![closeup photo of Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers and basil.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photos-680x1012.jpg)\n\nIngredient Substitutions\n------------------------\n\n*   **Peaches** – If you aren’t a fan of peaches, substitute them with nectarines.\n*   **Feta** – Goat cheese is a good substitution for feta. You could also use [queso fresco](https://www.thekitchn.com/queso-fresco-the-cheesemonger-91408) or [ricotta salata](https://www.belgioioso.com/Products/Ricotta-Salata)\n*   **Persian Cucumbers** – I love to use Persian cucumbers, which may also be called snacking cucumbers, because they’re extra crunchy and you don’t have to peel them. If you can’t find these, use an English cucumber instead. You may want to scoop out the seeds if you go this route, but you won’t need to peel it.\n*   **Blueberries** – Strawberries or blackberries would be a good substitute for blueberries. As with the blueberries and peaches, make sure they are the sweetest and freshest ones you can find to have the best results with this salad. You may find that the strawberries don’t hold up as long in the salad and get soft.\n*   **Honey** – Substitute with maple syrup.\n\n ![Blueberry Peach Feta Salad with cucumbers in a white serving bowl with a bowl of lemon basil dressing behind it.](https://reciperunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blueberry-peach-feta-salad-photograph-680x971.jpg)\n\nMore Peach Salad Recipes\n------------------------\n\n*   [Peach Tomato Caprese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-caprese-salad/)\n*   [Summer Chickpea Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [Grilled Chicken, Peach, Pecan and Goat Cheese Salad](https://reciperunner.com/grilled-chicken-peach-pecan-goat-cheese-salad/)\n*   [Peach, Tomato and Corn Panzanella](https://reciperunner.com/peach-tomato-corn-panzanella/)\n*   [Summer Vegetable Orzo Salad](https://reciperunner.com/summer-vegetable-orzo-salad/)\n\n**Prep Time** 15 minutes\n\n**Total Time** 15 minutes\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 pint fresh blueberries\n*   2 peaches, diced\n*   2 Persian cucumbers, sliced\n*   1/2 cup crumbled feta\n*   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\n*   1 tablespoon dijon mustard\n*   1 tablespoon honey\n*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   1 tablespoon finely chopped basil\n*   Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.

This spinach salad with pears, pecans and goat cheese is easy to make and delicious!\n\n![A beige bowl full of spinach pear salad.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-with-goat-cheese.jpg)\n\nThis spinach pear salad isn't exactly new or ground-breaking, but it's really delicious.\n\nEven back when I didn't really enjoying eating salads, I would happily eat this one. The combination of sweet baby spinach, crunchy toasted pecans and juicy pears works together so well, you might even be able to convert the salad haters in your life!\n\n![A beige bowl with baby spinach, slices of pear, crumbled goat cheese and pecan peices.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-with-pecans.jpg)\n\n🍐 Ingredients\n--------------\n\nThis recipe is simple, but packs a ton of flavour. Here's what I used in my salad.\n\n*   Baby Spinach\n*   Pears\n*   Pecans\n*   Goat Cheese\n\nFor the dressing, I wanted a balance of sweet and tangy flavours. To achieve that, I went with a balsamic and Dijon mustard vinaigrette. Feel free to use your favourite homemade or store-bought vinaigrette instead, though.\n\n🥬 Substitutions\n----------------\n\nWhile baby spinach works best in this recipe, you can also make it with flat-leaf (also known as smooth leaf) spinach. This is a sweet type of spinach that is best served raw, and it's usually what you'll find in bags at the grocery store.\n\nI would avoid using savoy spinach (the crinkly ones), as those can be bitter and benefit from being cooked.\n\nFor the pears, you have a few options. Bartletts, [the most-common pear worldwide](https://www.ontario.ca/foodland/food/pears), have a soft juicy texture that works well in this spinach salad. If you prefer a firmer texture, a Bosc or Green Anjou pear would be good options.\n\nYou can substitute walnuts, sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds for the pecans, and blue cheese or feta for the goat cheese.\n\n![An overhead view of a beige bowl of spinach pecan salad with pears and goat cheese.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad.jpg)\n\n🥗 Making the Salad\n-------------------\n\nThis salad is super easy to prepare, even if you toast your own pecans and make the vinaigrette from scratch.\n\nIf you opt to buy pre-washed baby spinach, pre-toasted nuts and a bottled vinaigrette, you're that much closer to eating!\n\nEssentially, once you've washed your produce, all that's left to do is slice your pears, chop your pecans, and crumble your cheese. Assemble, top with your dressing, and you're ready to eat!\n\nIt's important to note that you don't have to peel the pears if you don't want to. Not only does this save time, but [the skin is also a good source of fibre](https://usapears.org/fiber/). Just be sure to give your pears a good wash before cutting them up.\n\nIf the skin on your pears is very tough (which is sometimes the case when you buy them out of season) you can go ahead and peel them. I had to do that when I took the photos for this recipe.\n\nI hope you try making this salad, and if you do let me know what you think of it in the comments below!\n\n🖨 Printable Recipe\n-------------------\n\n![A beige bowl with baby spinach, slices of pear, crumbled goat cheese and pecans.](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spinach-pear-salad-featured-image-360x360.jpg)\n\nThis delicious spinach salad gets crunch from toasted pecans, creaminess from goat cheese and sweetness from juicy ripe pears!\n\nPREP TIME: 15 minutes\n\nTOTAL TIME: 15 minutes\n\nSERVINGS: 4 Servings\n\n[PRINT RECIPE](https://insearchofyummyness.com/wprm_print/spinach-pear-salad-with-pecans-and-goat-cheese) [SAVE RECIPE](https://app.grow.me/) [RATE RECIPE](#commentform)\n\n#### For the Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ ½ cup olive oil\n*   ▢ ¼ cup balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, optional (helps to emulsify the dressing)\n*   ▢ pinch of salt and pepper\n\n#### For the Salad:\n\n*   ▢ 8 cups baby spinach, washed and dried\n*   ▢ ½ cup pecans, toasted and chopped\n*   ▢ 2 large ripe pears, washed and sliced into wedges (peeling optional)\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup plain goat cheese, crumbled\n\n#### For the Dressing:\n\n*   Place all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until combined. Alternatively, you can add the ingredients to a mason jar, screw the lid on tightly, and shake to combine.\n    \n\n#### For the Salad:\n\n*   Place spinach and pecans in a large bowl. Add a few spoonfuls of dressing, then use your hands to toss the salad to combine the ingredients. Add the pear slices to the salad, and toss again, gently.\n    \n*   Divide the salad among serving plates, and top with goat cheese and extra dressing as needed. Serve immediately.\n    \n\nIf you don't want to make the salad dressing, you can try this recipe with your favourite store-bought vinaigrette, or a simple homemade oil and vinegar vinaigrette. \n\nSubstitutions:\n\n*   Use flat-leaf (or smooth-leaf) spinach instead of baby spinach. Avoid crinkly savoy spinach, as it's best eaten cooked. \n*   Bartlett pears are great if you want a lot of juice and sweetness. Bosc or Green Anjou pears are better options if you want more crunch.\n*   Walnuts, sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds can be used instead of pecans.\n*   Blue cheese or feta can be used instead of goat cheese. \n\nPlease read the blog post for detailed tips and explanations.\n\nCourse: Salad\n\nCuisine: Canadian\n\nCalories: 453 kcal\n\nCalories: 453kcal | Carbohydrates: 20g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 40g | Saturated Fat: 7g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 6g | Monounsaturated Fat: 26g | Cholesterol: 9mg | Sodium: 136mg | Potassium: 514mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 12g | Vitamin A: 5852IU | Vitamin C: 21mg | Calcium: 108mg | Iron: 3mg\n\nNutrition Disclaimer: this nutritional information is only an estimate.

This arugula and couscous salad has done just that. We make it for dinner, eat the leftovers for lunch, and have served it to friends more times than I can count.\n\nYou’ll be itching to make it again once you try this arugula salad recipe. The salad is **simple, fast, and tastes like it came from a fancy restaurant**.

It cooks quickly and **gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself**. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, barley, or other grains — farro is excellent in salads (see our [apple, arugula, and farro salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/43230/farro-salad-with-apples/) for inspiration).\n\nAdd crisp **cucumbers**, baby **arugula** (or other tender greens), and **feta** cheese to the couscous. The lemon vinaigrette is simple — just lemon juice, olive oil, and a little honey.\n\n**Tip:** Since the dressing is so simple, it’s easy to play with. If we have it on hand, we love throwing a tablespoon of minced preserved lemon to the party. You can buy it or make your own — we shared this [recipe for preserved lemon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/5543/olives-with-lemon-confit-and-chili-flakes/) a while back if you want to take a look.\n\n![Adding lemon vinaigrette to couscous for the arugula and couscous salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Arugula-Salad-Recipe-3-1200.jpg)\n\n**The real trick to this salad is assembling it:** toss most of the dressing with the warm couscous and let it cool slightly before adding other ingredients. We take the same approach when making potato salad (we toss warm potatoes with the dressing first). By doing this, the warm ingredient has a chance to absorb all the flavor in the dressing. A game changer.\n\nThe same idea applies if you swap the couscous for pasta or another grain. Toss the still-warm pasta/grain with the dressing first, let it absorb, and cool slightly. Then, move on to adding the rest of the ingredients.\n\n**This arugula salad would go really well next to** this [Seriously Good Turkey Burger](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/34790/seriously-good-turkey-burger/), our [Easy Lemon Garlic Baked Chicken Breasts](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28703/lemon-garlic-baked-chicken-breast-recipe/) and our [Perfectly Baked Salmon](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/149/moms-oven-poached-salmon/) (inspired by my Mom).\n\n![Lemon Arugula Salad with Couscous, Cucumbers and Feta](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lemon-Arugula-Salad-1200.jpg)\n\n**For more arugula recipes**, take a look at our [Fried Goat Cheese, Strawberry and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/648/fried-goat-cheese-arugula-salad/), our [Lemony White Bean and Arugula Salad](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/42176/white-bean-salad/), this lovely [Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad Recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/12907/shaved-fennel-and-arugula-salad-recipe/) and these [Baked Chicken Thighs with Potatoes, Garlic and Arugula](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/28824/baked-chicken-thighs-with-potatoes/).\n\nLemon Arugula Salad with Couscous and Feta\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   PREP 10mins\n*   COOK 10mins\n*   TOTAL 20mins\n\nOur arugula salad, made with an easy lemon vinaigrette, pearl couscous, cucumbers, and feta, is crave-worthy. Once you make it, you’ll be itching to make it again. We particularly love pearl (often labeled Israeli couscous) for this arugula salad. It cooks quickly and gives the salad enough substance to stand on the plate by itself. You could swap the couscous for pasta, quinoa, or other cooked grains like barley or wheat berries.\n\nMakes 4 large servings\n\nWatch Us Make the Recipe\n------------------------\n\nYou Will Need\n-------------\n\nFor the Salad\n\n1 ½ cups dried pearl (Israeli) couscous, _about 3 cups cooked_\n\n3 ounces baby arugula or tender salad greens, _about 4 cups_\n\nHalf of a hothouse (seedless) cucumber, chopped\n\n2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled, _about 1/2 cup_\n\nFor the Dressing\n\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, _about 1/2 large lemon_\n\n4 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup\n\n1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon, _optional_\n\n1 teaspoon dried basil or a handful chopped fresh basil leaves, _optional_\n\nSea salt and fresh ground black pepper\n\nDirections\n----------\n\n1Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add couscous and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, then add to a large bowl.\n\n2Meanwhile, make the lemon vinaigrette. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, honey, preserved lemon, and basil until it looks thick and blended. Season to taste with salt and fresh ground black pepper (we add a generous pinch of each).\n\n3Toss the cooked and drained couscous with the dressing, then set aside for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly. Finish the salad by adding the arugula, cucumbers, and feta. Toss well, then serve.\n\nAdam and Joanne's Tips\n----------------------\n\n*   The salad will keep overnight in the fridge. As it sits, the greens may wilt slightly, but still will taste great.\n*   If you cannot find pearl (Israeli) couscous, substitute with a regular couscous, small pasta shape such as orzo or cooked grains like quinoa, wheat berries and barley.\n*   Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates. We have used the USDA database to calculate approximate values.

    "markdown": "# Best EVER Spinach Orzo Salad - Barefeet In The Kitchen\nThis Spinach Orzo Salad is filled with cranberries, creamy goat cheese, tender pasta, and plenty of fresh spinach tossed in a tangy sweet dressing. The salad can be served immediately or kept in the refrigerator for 2-3 days – making this an awesome make-ahead meal for lunch or dinner.\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese in mixing bowl](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-6-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n#### Spinach Salad with Cranberries\n\nThe recipe was inspired by the Cranberry Orzo Salad that Princess Cruises serves in their International Cafe. It’s just so good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh, and delicious.\n\nI’ve included more cruise details at the bottom of the post here for anyone who is interested. As soon as I got home from [our cruise through the British Isles](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/monets-garden/), I immediately recreated the salad for my family.\n\nAs always, I loved the salad, but my guys? The kids decided that the fresh cranberries were too tart. (Crazy kids!)\n\nSo, the next time I made the salad, I went with dried cranberries and it was a win across the board. I like this salad every bit as much with dried cranberries as I do with fresh cranberries – and that’s an even bigger win, since fresh cranberries aren’t available more than a few weeks a year.\n\n(And unless you’re lucky enough to have [cranberries stashed in the freezer for this cake](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/cranberry-christmas-cake/), you’ll be stuck waiting until the holidays to try this awesome salad.)\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with Cranberries, Almonds, and Goat Cheese - close up photo](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-2-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\nI took our salad to the next level by adding a generous portion of fresh baby spinach and warm chicken. Both the chicken and the spinach made it a heartier meal for my family.\n\nAnd as far as my guys are concerned, when I include meat that immediately elevates a pasta salad from side dish to main dish status.\n\nFor what it’s worth though, the chicken in this salad really is optional, the salad is delicious without it. I might even prefer it that way myself.\n\n![spinach salad with orzo, cranberries, and goat cheese](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-3-1-of-1-731x1024.jpg)\n\n### Spinach Orzo Salad Recipe\n\n_You’ll need the following ingredients to make this:_\n\n*   olive oil\n*   orzo pasta\n*   baby spinach\n*   sliced almonds\n*   dried cranberries\n*   crumbled goat cheese\n*   chicken, optional\n\n**Dressing Ingredients**\n\n*   olive oil\n*   white balsamic vinegar\n*   honey\n*   salt and pepper\n\n_I’ve used both plain goat cheese and a honey goat cheese for this pasta and they’re both delicious._\n\n_However, I really loved the added flavor from the hint of honey in the specialty goat cheese. If you can find it at your store, give it a try!_\n\n![Spinach Orzo Salad with almonds and cranberries](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-4-1-of-1-1024x732.jpg)\n\n### Orzo Spinach Salad\n\nTo make this salad, you’ll begin by toasting the orzo over medium heat, about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add 4 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer, and cover with a lid for 7-8 minutes. Drain any liquid, fluff with fork.\n\nPlace the spinach in a large mixing bowl. Add the cooked orzo, cranberries, almonds, and cooked chicken – if desired.\n\nIn a small bowl or large measuring cup, combine the oil, vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well to coat.\n\nTop with goat cheese and toss lightly. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\n\n![orzo salad with spinach ](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spinach-Orzo-Salad-BFK-5-1-of-1-732x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Easy Salads with Spinach\n\nFresh sweet berries, crisp greens, crunchy pecans and a drizzle of creamy poppyseed dressing all add up to one of our favorite summer berry salads. While my boys haven’t always been the biggest salad fans, when this [Berry Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/berry-salad-recipe/) and [Poppyseed Dressing](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/creamy-poppyseed-dressing-recipe/) are on the table they are very happy to eat their salads.\n\nCrisp baby spinach, spring mix lettuces, tart apples, sweet raisins, crunchy almonds, and the ultimate honey cider salad dressing are combined to create a fantastic [Spinach Apple Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/carvers-salad-with-honey-cider-dressing/).\n\n[Strawberry Spinach Salad](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/strawberry-spinach-salad/) is the perfect salad for a summer night. Packed with fresh greens and sweet strawberries, this salad is finished with sliced almonds for just the right amount of crunch.\n\nThis [Spinach Pasta Salad with Tomatoes](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/spinach-pasta-salad-recipe/) is a tangy, garlicky, peppery pasta salad that I can’t seem to stop making and eating on repeat. The combination of crisp, fresh spinach with the chewy pasta and the tangy dressing is simply irresistible.\n\nGet New Recipessent to your inbox!\n\nWe never share your information with third parties and will protect it in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/disclosure-and-privacy-policy/).\n\nServings: 6\n\n*   ▢ ½ tablespoon light olive oil\n*   ▢ 8 ounces orzo pasta\n*   ▢ 4 cups fresh baby spinach, roughly chopped\n*   ▢ ½ cup sliced almonds\n*   ▢ ½ cup Craisins or dried cranberries\n*   ▢ 2-4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\n*   ▢ Optional: 2 cups cooked chicken, chopped bite-size\n\n#### Dressing Ingredients\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup olive oil, divided\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoons white balsamic or champagne vinegar\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon honey\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n*   Toast the orzo in ½ tablespoon oil over medium heat, about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add 4 cups water, and bring to a boil.

After hearing about it so much, the next time it was available, I had to try it.\n\nIt was so very good! Tender pasta in a sweetly tangy dressing, with tart fresh cranberries and sliced almonds. Simple, fresh. and delicious.\n\nThe [International Cafe](https://www.princess.com/ships-and-experience/ships/products/dining-included/international-cafe.html) is part of the all-inclusive dining options onboard each cruise ship. The cafe is open 24 hours a day and it’s one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat each time we cruise.\n\nThe morning selections include pastries and fresh croissants, breakfast sandwiches, quiche, fresh fruit, yogurt parfaits, and more. Later in the day, you’ll find a selection of small-bite meals and other sweet and savory treats.\n\nThe selections change daily, so when you find your favorite food there, you’ll want to make the most of it.\n\nAsk me how I know this? <_cough> Nutella donuts <cough>_ I cruised 3x before I managed to snag a much-talked-about Nutella donut and it didn’t disappoint. I’ve learned now to check the selections daily.\n\nEdited to add: I cruised the Caribbean with my sister Jenny a couple of years ago and as soon as we were on the ship for our last cruise (literally, as soon as we embarked), she and I stopped by the International Cafe and picked up some of the pasta salad, along with a sandwich, and a couple of coffees to take to our room and snack on as we were getting unpacked and settled.\n\nI’m happy to tell you that Princess’s Cranberry Orzo Salad was every bit as delicious as I remembered. And fortunately, now we can all enjoy it at home too.\n\nWant to check out more of our [Medallion Class cruise](https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/ocean-medallion/) through the Caribbean?

These black beans give you a little change up and introduce a little sweet and spice thanks to the ginger.\n*   The dressing that goes along with it helps add to the simple flavors of the sautéed black beans and shallots.\n*   This bowl also happens to be **vegan, gluten-free and nut free!** It’s also pretty easy to customize to preference.\n*   **Takes less than 30 minutes to make** and is **super easy to through together** for a quick meal.\n\n**Key Ingredients**\n-------------------\n\n*   **Ginger:** We use both fresh and dried for this recipe\n*   **Garlic:** Also, both fresh and dried\n*   **Black Beans:** Canned to make this come together quickly\n*   **Soy Sauce:** For some simple umami flavors\n*   **Lime:** A bright burst of citrus flavor to complement the ginger and sriracha\n*   **Tahini:** For the creamy factor of the dressing\n*   **Sriracha:** Get a little nice spicy element to the dish\n\n**How to make this nourish bowl**\n---------------------------------\n\nStart by prepping your beans. Rinse and drain your beans really well and set aside. In a pan, start by sautéing your shallots with a little oil until mostly softened. Then add in your garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant.\n\n*   ![Pan with sauced shallots and black beans.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_1.jpg)\n    \n*   ![black beans being stirred together with spinach.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_2.jpg)\n    \n\nThrow in your beans and continue to sauté to help incorporate more of the garlic and ginger flavors with the beans. Add in spinach and a little soy sauce and allow spinach to wilt.\n\n*   ![Ginger sriracha sauce being mixed together in a jar.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_3.jpg)\n    \n*   ![Bowl of ginger black beans with rice and sliced cucumber topped with ginger sriracha sauce and cilantro.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_4.jpg)\n    \n\nPrepare the sauce by mixing all of the dressing ingredients together. Adjust consistency by adding small amounts of water at a time until desired consistency is achieved.\n\n**Tips for making the perfect bowl**\n------------------------------------\n\n*   Canned beans make this dish come together really fast. It’s important to make sure you rinse your beans really well to remove the sauce that coats them. Not only will it make it easier to sauté the beans with your shallots and ginger, but it will also remove excess starches that are responsible for excess gas in your guts.\n*   Make sure you use a good quality tahini for your dressing. Good quality tahini should not taste bitter. It should be mild and smooth, so that it has an easier time highlighting the main flavors without taking away from them. My preferred brand is by Soom Foods.\n\n**How long will the dressing keep for?**\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe dressing can be stored in an airtight container or jar for up to 4 days. Before using after refrigeration, give it a good stir and adjust consistency with additional water if needed. Make sure to use very little additional water as the dressing will loosen up a little bit more as it comes to room temperature.\n\n**What to pair with your beans in your nourish bowl**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe beans and sauce go really well with rice or quinoa. You can also add in some baked tofu for more protein if desired. Cooling vegetables like cucumber go really well with this bowl as well. Top with some fresh herbs like cilantro and some avocado on the side make for an extra enjoyable bowl.\n\n**More Nourish Bowls to Try**\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Almond Miso Chickpea Nourish Bowl](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/02/almond-miso-chickpea-nourish-bowl/)\n*   [Edamame Crunch Salad](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/03/edamame-crunch-salad-with-sesame-cashew-lime-dressing/)\n*   [Tahini Ranch Tofu Sheet Pan](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/01/tahini-ranch-tofu-sheet-pan/)\n\n![Side of the black bean nourish bowl with a spoon tucked into it.](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GBB_5.jpg)\n\n[Print](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2021/04/black-bean-nourish-bowl/print/4059/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\nThis Black Bean Nourish Bowl gives you a new and fun way to flavor your black beans by using a creamy ginger and sriracha infused dressing.

I can head over there when I have NO idea what to make and usually come away with at least three ideas in no time at all.\n\nThis time one of those ideas was [Basil Chicken in Coconut Curry Sauce](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/basil_chicken_in_coconut_curry_sauce/). It went on my must-make list immediately. Basil Chicken is good, but basil chicken curry is way, way better, especially if that curry is a coconut curry sauce!\n\nShould I Use Chicken Breasts or Chicken Thighs?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nYou can use either chicken breasts or chicken thighs for this recipe, so it's totally up to you. Though chicken breasts have fewer calories and less fat (including saturated fat) than chicken thighs ([source](https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines-and-myplate/breasts-vs-thighs-which-is-more-nutritious)) and are often more expensive than thighs, a lot of people like the flavor of thighs better.\n\nThough the original basil chicken curry recipe called for thighs, I opted for breasts and I have to tell you that this dish makes chicken breasts taste absolutely incredibly!\n\nI totally get how people often think they're dry, bland, and boring, but this recipe really makes them delicious (if you're looking for another great chicken breast recipe, try my [Panko Crusted Chicken](https://wearenotmartha.com/panko-crusted-chicken/)). That said, I'm absolutely positive thighs would be amazing, too.\n\nIf you happen to have chicken legs on hand, try these [chicken leg quarter recipes](https://www.orwhateveryoudo.com/2020/03/sweet-chili-chicken-leg-quarters.html)!\n\nWhy is There No Curry Powder in This Coconut Curry Sauce?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nA couple people have commented on this recipe and asked why there is no curry powder or garam masala listed in the recipe ingredients. That's because curry powder is really just a blend of spices and rather simply use curry powder here, we're making our own custom spice mixture.\n\nDo you have to do this? Well, no. If you don't have these spices in your pantry and prefer to keep things simple, you can use curry powder or garam masala and end up with a fairly similar recipe.\n\nHowever, I've found that the blend of spices used in this recipe makes my ideal coconut curry sauce, which is why I'm sharing it here.\n\nIn fact, you might try this recipe and decide you'd adjust the spice mixture next time due to your own personal preferences.\n\nFeel free to experiment and come up a spice mixture that appeals to you and your family best!\n\nIs the Curry Sauce Spicy?\n-------------------------\n\nThere are many different kinds of curry sauce and some are spicy and some aren't. This particular coconut curry sauce isn't very spicy (there's just a little chili powder in it), but because there are jalapeño peppers in the dish, it can get a little spicy.\n\nIf you're not a fan of spice or are serving this dish to kids, I recommend being sure to scrape the seeds out of the jalapeños before chopping. The seeds hold most of the heat, so if you just include the pepper part, you'll mainly be getting the flavor.\n\nHowever, you can always cut down on the amount of jalapeño, too.\n\nWith all that said, please don't be intimidated by the seemingly long list of ingredients in this basil chicken curry recipe. Lots of them are spices that you probably already have in your pantry (if not, you should because you'll definitely use them again!).\n\nDespite all those ingredients (spices), this basil chicken in coconut curry sauce is so, so easy.\n\nStart by mixing all those beautiful spices together in a small bowl. Then put your chicken pieces in a large bowl and sprinkle the spice mixture all over it. Let the chicken rest for about 30 minutes.\n\nHeat 1 Tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and jalapeño and cook for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and cook for one more minute.\n\nRemove the vegetables from the pan and put in a medium sized bowl and set aside.\n\n![Collage showing process for making basil chicken in coconut curry sauce, including curry spices in a white bowl, onion and jalapeño cooking in a skillet, and onion and jalapeño with garlic cooked and resting in a bowl](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-Making.jpg)\n\nUsing the same pan, add another Tbsp of oil and add half of the chicken pieces, spreading them out to make sure they're not overcrowded. Cook for a few minutes on each side to brown.\n\nWhen they're cooked through, remove from the pan and add them to the bowl of onion/jalapeño. Repeat with remaining chicken and remove that to the bowl, too.\n\n![Cubed chicken breasts covered in spice cooking in oil in a skillet](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Chicken-Cooking-2-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nNow for the coconut curry sauce! Add the coconut milk to the skillet and cook on medium-high and stir until it thickens a bit and gets bubbly.\n\nThen mix in the Worcestershire sauce.\n\nAdd the chicken and onion/jalapeño, along with basil and ginger and cook for 2 more minutes.\n\n![Overhead view of coconut curry sauce with chicken and basil cooking in it](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-Cooking-4-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nServe the basil chicken curry over rice... brown is always best! But obviously you can use whatever kind of rice you want. Or even quinoa. Or cauliflower rice.\n\nHeck, eat it right out of the skillet with a spoon if you want with nothing on the side. I won't tell.\n\nOh my goodness, this basil chicken in coconut curry sauce is so incredibly flavorful and satisfying! I didn't scrape the seeds out of my jalapeños (because we love heat in my house!), so this definitely had an extra kick to it.\n\n![Head on view of basil chicken in coconut curry sauce sitting on a bed of brown rice in a white bowl](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-9-2-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nI also decided to add more fresh basil over the top since I legit love fresh basil so much. And since this dish is called basil chicken curry and all, I figured it needed some extra!\n\nI've never actually attempted making my own curry, but this coconut curry sauce is something I'll most definitely be making again.\n\nThere are sooo many things that can be done with curry and I love it so much.\n\nThere are also so many kinds of curry and I want to make them all!\n\n![Landscape view of a white bowl filled with brown rice that's topped with basil chicken in coconut curry sauce with fresh basil on top](https://wearenotmartha.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Chicken-in-Coconut-Curry-Sauce-3-2-2-1024x683.jpg)\n\nLike I mentioned, you can definitely use chicken thighs for this recipe, but I was really happy I used chicken breasts because they ended up being so moist and flavorful when cooked in the spices and in the coconut curry sauce.\n\nSome people prefer using chicken thighs to breasts because breasts can be drier and less flavorful, but that is not the case with this recipe!\n\nMore Easy Chicken Dinner Recipes\n--------------------------------\n\nThere are so many boring chicken recipes out there, so I've made it one of my goals to only share chicken recipes that are incredibly flavorful and delicious.

For potlucks, baby showers or wedding showers, I love to serve with a [cucumber sandwich](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/cucumber-sandwiches/).\n*   **Chicken dinner:** Try it with [chicken kabobs](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/chicken-kabobs/) and some grilled potatoes.\n*   **Seafood:** [Grilled shrimp skewers](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/grilled-shrimp-skewers/) or salmon are also delicious alongside this Caprese salad.\n\n**Why is it called a Caprese salad?**\n\nThis salad is name after the island of Capri where it is said to have originated. Capri is an island in Italy and this salad is called ‘Insalata Caprese’ which translates to the salad of Capri.\n\n**Can I omit the balsamic?**\n\nIf you would like to. You can opt to season with only salt, pepper and olive oil. I find this works best when tomatoes are at their peak during the summertime. The balsamic adds additional flavor during months where tomatoes are not in season.\n\n**What kind of tomatoes are best for Caprese?**\n\nFor this chopped Caprese salad, I prefer halved cherry tomatoes although grape tomatoes work as well. If you are layering slices of the salad, heirloom tomatoes are popular.\n\n**Can I substitute the fresh mozzarella cheese?**\n\nFresh mozzarella is a key ingredient in this salad. You could try fresh burrata cheese but I would not use low moisture or part-skim mozzarella as it will change the texture of the salad and add additional salt.\n\n![Tomato basil mozzarella salad in white bowl.](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Caprese-salad-2.jpg \"This easy Caprese salad is filled with ripe tomatoes, mozzarella balls, fresh basil and then topped with a homemade balsamic glaze for the most delicious combination.

    "markdown": "# Honey Lime Basil Peach Fruit Salad | Ambitious Kitchen\nA few years ago I fell in love with peaches. Not that they weren’t good all those years before, but it wasn’t until after having some sort of [peach pie or crisp](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/gluten-free-peach-crisp-salted-coconut-milk-caramel/) that I really committed to loving them like I’ve never loved a fruit before.\n\nExcept maybe Honeycrisp apples; those sweet crunchy things lure me in every time (even if they’re $4.99/pound). I know… shame on me.\n\nToday’s **peach fruit salad** is one that I make every time I entertain during the summer months; it’s the perfect side dish to accompany [grilled chicken](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/best-chicken-marinades/), [salmon](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/firecracker-salmon-with-peach-avocado-salsa/) or veggie [kabobs](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/vegan-turmeric-pineapple-tofu-kabobs/).\n\nAnother reason I dig this peach fruit salad? Because it’s a wonderful way to get kids to really dig into some fresh, nutritious fruit. The best part of this recipe though is that it’s completely customizable, so if you feel like adding other berries or fruit, you can! Sometimes I use yellow nectarines but usually, I opt for sweet, ripe fresh yellow peaches because of their unique sweetness and texture.\n\n![ingredients for peach fruit salad on a surface](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-1.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate.

Head to the farmer’s market (or your own garden!) and grab:\n\n*   Fresh yellow peaches\n*   Blackberries\n*   Blueberries\n*   A pomegranate\n*   Fresh basil leaves\n*   Lime juice\n*   Honey\n\nThis fresh, summer produce is then drizzled with a bit of honey and a squeeze of lime juice for a sweet and tangy finish to the delicious fruit. I love how the basil brings a fresh earthiness and makes the fruit salad a bit different from what we’re used to.\n\n![summer peach fruit salad ingredients in a bowl with basil ribbons on top](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-2.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate.

Here are some of my favorites:\n\n*   Add it to the perfect, [juicy grilled chicken](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/how-to-grill-chicken-breast/ \"How to Grill Chicken Breast that’s Perfectly Juicy\")\n*   Serve it on the side of a flavorful [burger](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/cheddar-bbq-chicken-burgers/ \"Seriously Good Sweet Potato Cheddar BBQ Chicken Burgers\") (or [vegan burger](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/ultimate-black-bean-burgers-with-tahini-garlic-cream/ \"Ultimate Vegan Black Bean Burgers with Creamy Tahini Garlic Sauce\")!)\n*   It’s delicious with grilled or baked [salmon](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/firecracker-salmon-with-peach-avocado-salsa/ \"Firecracker Salmon with Peach Avocado Salsa\")\n*   Everyone will love this with my [slow cooker pulled chicken sandwiches](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/slow-cooker-pulled-chicken-sandwiches/ \"Incredible Slow Cooker Pulled Chicken Sandwiches\")\n*   Simple [sweet & spice grilled chicken](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/grilled-ginger-chicken/ \"Sticky, Sweet & Spicy Grilled Ginger Chicken\") is the perfect complement\n\n![summer peach fruit salad in a bowl with basil ribbons](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-3.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate. This summer peach fruit salad recipe is lightly tossed with honey, lime juice, and fresh basil leaves for a fresh side dish that's perfect for bbq's and parties!\")\n\nCustomize this summer peach fruit salad\n---------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to make this fruit salad your own!\n\n*   **Go vegan.** Keep it vegan by omitting the honey or use a bit of maple syrup.\n*   **Add more summer fruits.** Feel free to add strawberries, raspberries, nectarine or fresh cherries!\n*   **Choose your herbs.** Swap the basil for fresh mint.\n*   **Add a kick of heat.** Get a little wild with a sprinkle of chili powder or cayenne pepper.\n*   **Make a meal.** Add some feta or goat cheese crumbles, creamy avocado and your favorite greens like arugula or spinach to make a light lunch salad!\n\nWhat fruit is best for fruit salad?\n-----------------------------------\n\nI have found that fruit salad is best with firm berries and other fruit that doesn’t easily break down or get mushy so if you want to prep the salad a few hours ahead of time, you totally can. I suggest avoiding raspberries, watermelon and bananas, as they can easily get soggy. Make sure that when you add peaches they aren’t overly ripe and still have some firmness to them!\n\n![summer peach fruit salad on a platter with basil](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Honey-Lime-Peach-Fruit-Salad-4.jpg \"Gorgeous honey lime basil peach fruit salad made with fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries and pomegranate.

Then with the motor still running, add olive oil in a slow stream until emulsified and creamy.\n    \n*   Drizzle olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat then add zucchini noodles, cooking for about 1 to 2 minutes until tender.\n    \n*   Add zucchini noodles to a large bowl and toss with avocado pesto.

These meatballs are tender to the core! Nestled in a rich and creamy lemon sauce, they are perfect to serve over pasta, quinoa, or fluffy rice!\n\n![greek chicken meatballs in lemon cream sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-12-710x1065.jpg)\n\nWarm, hearty and deliciously creamy!\n\nThese tender, seared chicken meatballs are rolling around in a creamy lemon sauce that has a nice little zing! They’re warm and comforting but still offer a bright and beautiful lemony flavor that doesn’t leave you feeling heavy. Don’t be surprised if you catch the fam eating right out of the skillet while the sauce is still warm and tangy.\n\nIt’s the perfect transitional meal to take us from summer right into fall or from winter into spring. I’m not quite ready to let go of all the summer flavors, but with the gloomy weather we’ve been having lately, I’m ready for warm bowls of food again. Greek chicken meatballs totally fit the bill.\n\n![chicken meatballs in lemon sauce with cooked orzo in speckled bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**What do you need to make the Greek chicken meatballs?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Garlic + herbs:** minced garlic, chopped parsley, and dried oregano help add flavor the meatballs. You can use fresh or dried herbs for this recipe. Keep in mind you need roughly double the amount if you’re using fresh herbs.\n*   **Lemon zest:** brightens up the meatballs and adds just a fresh flavor to them\n*   **breadcrumbs:** are used for binding. I prefer to use [Panko](https://amzn.to/31UtFlz) breadcrumbs because they melt right into the meatballs and you don’t even realize they’re there.\n*   **Feta cheese:** adds tang and aids in binding the meatballs as well. Before this recipe, I had never added feta cheese to homemade meatballs, and I love the flavor they add.\n*   **An egg:** Acts as a binder to hold everything together.\n*   **Ground chicken:** I prefer to use ground chicken breasts, but I would think if you like chicken thighs, you might want to use ground thighs here. They would certainly add more flavor and retain extra moisture as well!\n\n![ingredients for the meatball ball mixture in stainless steel bowl](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-17-710x1065.jpg)\n\n### **How to portion chicken meatballs:**\n\nOnce you’ve made the meatball mixture, divide it into 24-28 portions. I like to use a [cookie scoop](https://amzn.to/3jSfROH) so that the meatballs are all the same size. Doing this also cuts down on the guesswork for cooking the meatballs because they cook up in roughly the same amount of time when they’re the same size.\n\n### **What if the meatball mixture sticks to my hands?**\n\nIf the meatball mixture sticks to your hands when you’re rolling them, just spray the inside of your hands with a little cooking spray before grabbing the meat mixture. This should keep the mixture from sticking to your hands!\n\n![close up of cooked chicken meatball in lemon cream sauce on a spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-4-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**How to make Greek chicken meatballs:**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.  In a bowl, combine everything but the meat mixture along with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. I use a fork to mix all the ingredients together.\n2.  When the ingredients are mix, add the ground chicken and mix until just combined. You don’t want to overwork the meat mixture or you’ll be left with tough and dry meatballs. Portion the meatballs using a cookie scoop into roughly 1 ½ tablespoon portions. \n3.  Add a drizzle of oil to a hot skillet and cook the meatballs for about 5-7 minutes or until they cook all the way through. You want to flip them so that they brown evenly on all sides. Be sure to not overcrowd the pan or they won’t brown!\n\n> **TIP:** At this point, you can allow the meatballs to cool and freeze them for later. If you plan on making this midweek and don’t have the time to fry the meatballs the day of, just freeze the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment. When frozen, transfer to a freezer-safe bag.\n\n![close up of prepared meatballs in lemon sauce in cast iron skillet](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-6-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients for the lemon sauce for Greek chicken meatballs?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Butter:** Butter plays a two-part role in the sauce. We’ll use a little bit to sauté the garlic and flour in and the last tablespoon is added at the end to add creaminess and a little bit of luster to the sauce.\n*   **Garlic:** sautéed in butter it adds so much delicious flavor to the sauce\n*   **flour:** just a tablespoon is used in this recipe to help thicken the sauce\n*   **Chicken stock:** is the base of the creamy lemon sauce\n*   **Green olives:** briny green olives are the perfect pairing to the bright zingy lemon sauce. Capers would also work if you aren’t a fan of green olives\n*   **Egg yolks:** the egg yolks I know are an unusual addition to a cream sauce. They help emulsify the sauce and make it extra creamy and delicious! Trust me, I was super scared to try it too, but I have a foolproof method for you below!\n*   **Lemon juice + zest:** help flavor the sauce\n*   **Nutmeg:** Add a depth of flavor that works beautifully with all the lemony flavor in this recipe. [Freshly grated](https://amzn.to/2Ds0dtI) works best!\n\n![lemon sauce pouring from spoon oven meatballs in bowl with orzo](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-5-710x1065.jpg)\n\n**The secret to perfectly smooth lemon sauce:**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1.  **Cook the flour:** Add a knob of butter to the skillet and allow the butter to melt. Saute the garlic in the butter until fragrant. Then, add the flour and whisk. You want to let the flour cook for 30 seconds to get rid of the raw flavor. Then, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Once the stock is completely incorporated, allow it to reach a simmer and then let cook for a few minutes until it thickens just a tad bit.\n2.  **Combine the yolks and lemon juice:** While the sauce is thickening, you want to add the lemon juice to a bowl along with the egg yolks and whisk them to combine. Then, once the sauce is thickened, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet to the lemon egg mixture as you whisk. **Adding the hot liquid to the eggs and lemon juice will help temper the yolks so that the sauce doesn’t break later.** You’ll repeat the same thing a total of three times or until you’ve added a total of 3 tablespoons of the liquid to the yolk mixture.\n3.  **Finish the sauce:** With the skillet on the lowest heat setting, stir the yolk mixture into the skillet. Once combined, kick the heat up to medium and continue to stir and cook the sauce for 4-6 minutes until it thickens to your liking. Keep in mind it will thicken quite a bit when it cools, so you don’t want to thicken it too much at this point if you plan on serving it later! Stir in the lemon zest and the nutmeg. Then, add the butter and green olives to the sauce and stir to combine. Place the meatballs back into the pan and allow them to just heat through. Serve warm over buttered orzo, or with fried bread on the side.\n\n### If you like this recipe, you might also like:\n\n*   [Greek Avgolemono Soup](https://littlespicejar.com/avgolemono-soup/)\n*   [Rustic Chicken Piccata Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/rustic-chicken-piccata-meatballs/)\n*   [French Onion Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/comforting-french-onion-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Cajun Chicken Meatballs in Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/cajun-chicken-meatballs/)\n*   [Swedish Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/swedish-meatballs/)\n*   [Firecracker Chicken Meatballs](https://littlespicejar.com/firecracker-chicken-meatballs/)\n\n![skillet with meatballs and sauce with wooden spoon](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-7-710x1065.jpg)\n\n![Greek Chicken Meatballs in Lemon Cream Sauce](https://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Greek-Chicken-Meatballs-in-Lemon-Sauce-14-735x1102.jpg)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Meatballs:\n\n*   5 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon EACH: lemon zest AND chopped parsley\n*   ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs\n*   ⅓ cup grated yellow onions\n*   ½ cup crumbled feta cheese\n*   1 large egg\n*   1 ½ teaspoon dried oregano (a little more if it’s fresh)\n*   1 ¼ pound lean ground chicken\n\n#### Lemon Olive Sauce:\n\n*   3 tablespoons salted cold butter, cubed\n*   3 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n*   1 ½ cups low sodium chicken stock\n*   ½ cup green olives (or use ¼ cup capers!)\n*   2 teaspoons lemon zest + ⅓ cup lemon juice\n*   2 egg yolks\n*   ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\n### Instructions\n\n1.  **MEATBALLS:** In a medium bowl, using a fork, mix together all the ingredients except the ground chicken. You also want to add 1 teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper. When the ingredients are combined, add the ground chicken and mix until \\*just\\* combined. Just be sure you don’t overwork the meat. Roll into 24-28 meatballs using a cookie scoop or about 1 ½ tablespoon each.\n2.  **COOK:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle in a little oil. Add the meatballs to the skillet but do not overcrowd. Cook in batches if they don’t all fit. Sear the meatballs for 5-7 minutes, flipping to brown all sides evenly, until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. Remove the meatballs to a plate.\n3.  **SAUCE:** Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet along with the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn. Add the flour and whisk. Once the flour cooks for 30 seconds, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Then, allow the sauce to reach a simmer, and continue to cook for 3 minutes or until the sauce thickens a bit. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and let the sauce hang out. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and egg yolks. Once combined, add a tablespoon of the sauce from the skillet into the egg mixture while you whisk it. Repeat this step two more times (so a total of 3 tablespoon of sauce should be added to the yolks.) Then, with the heat on the lowest setting, add the yolk mixture to the sauce you have on the stove. Kick the heat up to medium and stir the sauce and allow it to cook for 4-6 minutes or until it thickens to your liking. Then, stir in the nutmeg and lemon zest. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper as desired. Add the last tablespoon of butter to the sauce and allow it to melt in slowly. Add the green olives to the sauce along with the meatballs. Let them heat through for just a minute or two until warm. Serve with fried bread, over buttered orzo, or rice!\n\nThis site contains affiliate links, if you make a purchase through them, we receive a small commission.\n\n_originally published on_ Sep 3, 2020 _(last updated_ Jul 9, 2022_)_\n\n[54 comments](https://littlespicejar.com/greek-chicken-meatballs-in-lemon-cream-sauce/#comments) [Leave a comment »](#respond)"

Please read our [disclosure policy](https://lilluna.com/terms/).\n\n_Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness. They are perfect for meatless Monday or dinner with vegetarian friends!_\n\nServe spinach ricotta stuffed pepper with a grain of your choice! We love to serve our stuffed peppers with [rice](https://lilluna.com/crock-pot-rice/) or for more veggies, a [cauliflower rice.](https://lilluna.com/cauliflower-rice/) Either way, it’s delicious!\n\n![Stuffed Peppers served over a bed of white rice](https://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-peppers-resize-10.jpg \"Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness. They are perfect for meatless Monday or dinner with vegetarian friends!\")\n\nEasy Stuffed Peppers Recipe\n---------------------------\n\nI don’t eat too many meatless meals, but when I do they usually involve lots of cheese or cream. Hello [pizza](https://lilluna.com/margherita-pizza/) and [fettuccine](https://lilluna.com/easy-fettuccine-alfredo/)! Thank heavens for dairy and that I’m not allergic or intolerant. Seriously, I barely go a meal without some kind of dairy product.\n\nIf you like [cheese](https://lilluna.com/tag/cheese/) as much as I do then you’ll love these Spinach Ricotta Stuffed Peppers! The peppers are jam packed with sautéed onion, garlic, and spinach, plus ricotta and parmesan cheese! I can assure you each bite is so full of flavor.\n\nThis recipe calls for 2 bell peppers cut in half, which serves 4 people. But if you’re feeding a larger crowd, or you can eat more than one half pepper, you can easily double the recipe! In that case, the Costco size pack of bell peppers might come in handy. 😉\n\nThese stuffed peppers are so flavorful and cheesy and way too easy to throw together. I have a feeling I’m going to be making these a lot more this spring and summer.\n\n![Easy Stuffed Bell Peppers and grape tomatoes in a white baking dish](https://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spinach-ricotta-stuffed-peppers-resize-5.jpg \"Super easy spinach ricotta Stuffed Peppers are full cheesy goodness. They are perfect for meatless Monday or dinner with vegetarian friends!\")\n\nHow to Make Stuffed Bell Peppers\n--------------------------------\n\nThis recipe is SO easy… And the peppers themselves only require a handful of ingredients!\n\n**FILLING.** Cook up some onions and garlic, wilt the spinach, season, and then mix it with the ricotta and Parmesan cheese.\n\n**STUFF.** Take the mixture and stuff it into each pepper half.\n\n**BAKE.** Toss the tomatoes into the 9×13 pan. Drizzle with a little olive oil and then salt and pepper. Arrange the stuffed peppers in the pan with the tomatoes and then bake at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes.\n\n**GARNISH.** Top with more parmesan, fresh basil or parsley.\n\nMeanwhile, make your grain. What’s your go-to grain? Quinoa, rice, orzo? I really enjoyed these peppers with [Orzo Rice](https://www.garnishandglaze.com/orzo-rice/). You just toast the orzo in butter until golden and then add some rice and proceed as you would normally cook rice. So good!\n\nTips + SToring INfo\n-------------------\n\n**Add protein** by incorporating roasted chickpeas, beans, or crumbled sausage/hamburger\n\n**To make it spicy**, add crushed red pepper flakes or a splash of hot sauce\n\n**STORE** stuffed peppers in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. The peppers will get softer as time progresses. \n\n**To make ahead,** assemble the stuffed peppers ahead of time and keep them covered in the fridge for 24 hours before baking. Bake like normal.\n\n**REHEAT** the stuffed peppers either in the microwave or in the oven.

The ground pork has a higher fat content than the ground beef which keeps these meatballs perfectly juicy and flavorful.\n\n**Step One:** The first step to making these meatballs is to chop the herbs, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. For ultimate flavor this recipe uses a combination of fresh mint, dill, and parsley as well as red onion and garlic.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8c4b5e6.jpg)\n\n**Step Two:** Once you have chopped everything, now it’s time to make the meatballs. Add the ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, and herbs to a mixing bowl. This is also when you’ll add the dried herbs, spices, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything until well combined.\n\n**Step Three:** When the meat, herbs, and spices are well combined use a cookie dough scoop to form the meatballs and then roll them in between the palm of your hands. Place them on a sheet pan that has been drizzled with olive oil.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8d074cf.jpg)\n\n**Step Four:** After all of the meatballs have been rolled and placed on the sheet pan, bake them at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes until they have cooked all the way through.\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8e065f6.jpg)\n\nCool and Creamy Tzatziki Sauce\n------------------------------\n\nThe meatballs are definitely the star of this recipe but the cool and creamy tzatziki sauce deserves an award, too. If you have never had tzatziki before I am incredibly excited for you to try this recipe because, honestly, it just might change your life. I know that’s a bold claim but trust me.\n\nTzatziki is a thick sauce made from a combination of Greek yogurt, cucumber, dill, garlic, salt, and lemon juice. Tzatziki sauce is great with these meatballs but it is also perfect as a dip for fresh veggies, pita bread, or crackers.\n\nIf you have had tzatziki before but you’ve been intimidated by the idea of making it at home yourself, this is your lucky day. Homemade tzatziki is so easy to make and, personally, one of my favorite condiments to make at home.\n\nHaving a food processor or high-powered blender makes whipping up a batch of tzatziki even easier because you can quickly chop the garlic, dill, and cucumber. Once that step is done, all you have to do is add the cumber, garlic, dill, Greek yogurt, salt, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Stir everything until well combined and store in the fridge!\n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8eb6aee.jpg)\n\nHow to Serve the Meatballs\n--------------------------\n\nThere are few different ways you can serve these meatballs and they are all absolutely delicious. I encourage you to get creative but, of course, I’ll share some of my favorite ways to eat these yummy meatballs!\n\n*   **Serve them an appetizer or party snack!** These Greek meatballs are perfect to serve at a dinner party or as a fun appetizer. You can make a double batch of the meatball, put a cocktail stick in each one, and then serve the tzatziki on the side as a dipping sauce.\n    \n\n*   **Make a delicious Greek salad bowl!** This is one of my favorite ways to serve these meatballs. Place them over a bed of fresh romaine or your favorite mixed greens and serve with tomatoes, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, dill, peppers, and whatever other veggies sound good. You can also add rice or [Greek chickpea salad](https://www.allthehealthythings.com/recipeindex/greek-chickpea-salad) to your bowl if you would like. Finish off your bowl with a generous drizzle of tzatziki.\n    \n\n*   **Stuff them in a pita!** If a Greek pita sandwich is more your thing, feel free to stuff these meatballs in a pita with chopped lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, and of course, plenty of tzatziki sauce.\n    \n\n![Greek Meatballs with Tzatziki Sauce](https://allthehealthythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_5e9f3e8f8e159.jpg)\n\nIf You Love This Greek Meatball Recipe, Here a Few More Delicious Recipes You Should Try\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   Greek Chicken Meatballs\n*   One Pan Greek Chicken with Artichokes\n*   Greek Pasta Salad\n*   Greek Salmon Salad\n*   Greek Broccoli Pasta Salad\n\nI hope you give these **Greek Meatballs** a try!

    "markdown": "# Spicy Honey-Lime Chicken - Two Kooks In The Kitchen\nThe combination of honey (or maple syrup), soy sauce, sriracha, zesty lime, garlic and ginger in this spicy honey lime chicken recipe is wicked. Delicious hot, room temp or cold.\n\nYou can make the recipe with whole boneless chicken thighs or chicken breasts on skewers or with bone-in chicken.\n\n![3 chicken thigh skewers on cutting board](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_0023.jpg)\n\nMy favorite is boneless skinless chicken thighs (pictured here) because they are so flavorful, they absorb the marinade well and they tend to stay moister than breasts. If you’ve read any of our other chicken posts, you’ve heard this. Many times.\n\nThe spicy honey lime chicken marinade with its tart citrus tang – so delicious, so much flavor – also works well with pork skewers, tenderloin or chops. Even tofu. It’s one of my favorite chicken thigh recipes.\n\nBest side dish for this chicken dinner\n--------------------------------------\n\nThat’s hard. So many things go well with honey-lime chicken thighs. Here are some great ideas for a side and side salad: [citrus salad](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/citrus-salad/), [easy potato knishes](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/super-easy-potato-knishes/), [bread salad with charred snap peas](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/bread-salad-with-charred-snap-peas/), [grilled corn salad](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-corn-salad/), [party salad with grilled vegetables and quinoa,](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/party-salad-grilled-vegetables-quinoa/) [roasted baby cauliflower](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/roasted-baby-cauliflower/) and [grilled vegetable orzo salad recipe](https://twokooksinthekitchen.com/grilled-vegetable-orzo/).\n\nTailor To Your Taste\n--------------------\n\n### **How to serve honey lime chicken**\n\n*   I love the grilled chicken skewers format the best because you get the maximum glaze covering the chicken. But you can also use whole chicken breasts or thighs. If using bone-in, I suggest doubling the marinade.\n*   For appetizers, use regular boneless chicken thighs or breasts. Once cooked, cut the chicken into small pieces and thread on small wooden skewers or toothpicks to serve.\n*   The chicken is fabulous served in pita or tortillas with a tangy coleslaw or Israeli salad.\n\n### **Options for honey lime chicken marinade**\n\n*   Vary the amount of sriracha heat you like. The amount in the recipe is fairly spicy. I know some will like it even hotter. Or some not at all. If you don’t have sriracha, try chili powder or red pepper flakes.\n*   Replace the lime with lemon in the honey lime mixture (marinade).\n*   Try adding coriander or a favorite spice to the marinade.\n\n### **Cooking method alternatives**\n\n*   If you don’t have a grill, broil the chicken skewers in the oven for 9-12 minutes.\n*   Cooking time will take longer with bone in chicken. Heat one side of the grill on low, the other on medium high. Cook until almost done ((140F) on the low side, then switch to the hotter side to brown and finish cooking.\n\nShortcuts\n---------\n\n*   Skip the skewers and cook boneless or bone-in chicken (not cut up). Still delish! And **dinner in 20 minutes**.\n*   Substitute 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder for the fresh garlic.\n*   Marinate at room temperature for 30-40 minutes instead of 4-6 hours or overnight in the fridge. Or skip the marinating altogether. The flavors won’t be as intense, but still great.

Delicious hot, room temp or cold.\n\nPrep Time10 minutes\n\nCook Time10 minutes\n\nMarinating time30 minutes\n\nTotal Time50 minutes\n\nCourse: Appetizer, Main Course\n\nCuisine: American\n\nServings: 5\n\n*   ▢\n    \n    Skewers (metal or wood). If using wood, soak for 30 minutes before using. Skewers not needed if using uncut boneless or bone in chicken.\n    \n\n*   ▢ 2 1/2 pounds (1.13kg) boneless skinless thighs, trimmed and cut into 2 inch/5.1cm pieces, **Note 1** **chicken tenders or boneless breasts are fine too**\n*   ▢ **Garnish**: 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro or parsley; lime wedges\n\n#### Honey Lime chicken marinade (and glaze), Note 2\n\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoon soy sauce low sodium is good if you have\n*   ▢ 6 tablespoon honey or maple syrup\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon lime zest from one lime\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoon fresh lime juice from 1 1/2 to 2 limes\n*   ▢ 4 garlic cloves, minced or grated (or 1/2 tsp garlic powder)\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (about 1 1/2 inch of fresh ginger)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n*   ▢ 1 1/2 tablespoon Sriracha sauce for pretty spicy (use more or less to taste)\n*   ▢ 1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch (to thicken to glaze consistency) Optional\n\n*   **MAKE MARINADE/SAUCE**: Whisk all marinade ingredients together in a small bowl. Or blend them in a food processor.\n    \n*   **MARINATE CHICKEN:** Pour **half** the marinade (about 1/2 cup) into a sealed zipper bag or container and add chicken. Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or 6-12 hours in fridge. _Tip: if marinating overnight, I leave out lime juice and increase zest so it doesn't 'cook' the chicken._\n    \n    **Glaze:** The reserved 1/2 cup marinade will be used for glazing/basting. _(_**Optional but suggested**_: Mix 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch into reserved marinade and microwave for 1 minute to make a glaze-like consistency. I do this)._ Set aside.\n    \n*   **PREPARE GRILL**: Scrape grill and spray grill with oil (or dip paper towel in oil and rub on grill). Heat grill to medium-high heat. If using wood skewers, soak them for 30 minutes beforehand to avoid burning. **Note 3**.\n    \n*   **GRILL CHICKEN SKEWERS**: Skewer marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and _pat dry (__important__)_. Discard the marinade used for marinating. Lightly spray chicken with oil to further avoid sticking. Grill on all sides until chicken cooks to a golden brown (you'll need to turn chicken a couple of times), for 9-12 minutes in total (depending on thickness and how tightly packed the skewers are), basting once or twice with the honey lime glaze. Instant thermometer will read 160F/71C. Rest chicken, loosely covered for 5 minutes.\n    \n*   **SERVE**: If you have any leftover sauce, drizzle it on the chicken or warm it in microwave for 30 seconds and pass it around. Sprinkle chicken with cilantro or parsley and serve with lime wedges if desired. Serve hot or at room temperature.\n    \n\n1.  **Chicken options:**\n    *   I prefer thighs because they are juicier and less likely to dry out when cooked. In this recipe, however, breasts work really well too when marinated.\n    *   Instead of skewered chicken, you can also cook regular bone-in or boneless chicken (but make extra marinade for bone-in)\n    *   Kosher chicken is juicier and has a little extra flavor because it is already brined. \n2.  **Marinade/glaze**: If you are using bone in chicken, I suggest doubling the marinade/glaze. In fact, you might also want to double it (or do 1 1/2 times the amounts) to use as a dipping sauce or to soak into a side of rice or quinoa. \n3.  **No grill?** Instead, chicken can be broiled in the oven, turning once, for 9-12 minutes, brushing with the glaze.\n4.  **Make Ahead:** The recipe can be made ahead for a crowd and served at room temperature or cold. Or warmed briefly in the microwave for a minute or two. Don’t overdo it or the chicken will dry out and toughen.\n\n_Nutritional information estimates include boneless chicken breasts.

It is just a wonderfully seasoned dish of roasted deliciousness.

You don’t want the veggies to break down too much, but if they do, no worries.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.\n2.  Place the **Spice/Herb Ingredients** into a small bowl, mix to combine, set aside.\n3.  Place all the **Bake Ingredients** and **Spice/Herb mix** into a deep ceramic/enamel lined Dutch oven or similar roasting pan. Mix well everything to ensure all the ingredients are evenly coated.  Sprinkle the top lightly with some additional sea salt and black pepper.  Cover with a tight-fitting lid, then place in a preheated 400 F oven and roast for 40 minutes.\n4.  After 40 minutes, remove from the oven and gently mix in the cannellini beans, cover and return to the oven for another 5 to 20 minutes **or until the potatoes are perfectly tender**. The 2nd baking time is largely dependent upon the size of the potatoes. (see notes on baking time).\n5.  After 5 minutes (or 20 minutes), remove from the oven, remove the lid and allow the heat to escape for approx. 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.\n6.  Sprinkle individual portions with nutritional yeast (or [**_Vegan Parmesan Cheese_**](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/vegan-parmesan-cheese/)) and serve with some freshly chopped parsley.\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n**\\*Vegetable Stock:**   We use **_Pacific Organic Low Sodium Vegetable Stock_**. We love this brand because it is Whole Food Plant Based compliant, as it does not contain MSG, has no oil, and does not contain any highly-processed ingredients.\n\n**\\*Stock Amount:** The amount of vegetable stock is a personal preference.  This is not a stew, so there is little broth, but the veggies are coated in a nice thin-like rustic gravy.  If you want more “gravy”, use 4 tablespoons of vegetable stock.\n\n**\\*Baking Soda:**  The baking soda is often used as a neutralizer for dishes that contain a lot of acidity, typically from tomatoes.  We use it in this dish to remove some of the tomato acidity without losing the tomatoey flavor. When you add it, the mixture will bubble up, then settle down as it neutralizes the acidity.\n\n**\\*Dried Thyme Crushed Leaves:**  We use **_[Penzeys French Thyme](https://amzn.to/31Ud5iK)_**.  It has amazing flavor.  If you can’t find dried crushed thyme leaves, you can use ground thyme, but use half the amount.\n\n**\\*Zucchini Texture:**  Because the zucchini is in the oven for a long period of time, it will be mushy. This is a rustic bake, so this is expected. However, we know there may be folks who prefer a firmer texture. Please feel free to add the zucchini later in the oven baking process if you do not enjoy mushy zucchini.\n\n**\\*Potato Wedges:**  Potato wedges take longer to cook than cubed potatoes.  If you are looking to shorten the oven time, then cube the potatoes.  When checking for tenderness of the potatoes, be sure to check multiple potatoes as the ones that are on the bottom tend to cook faster than the ones on top.  Avoid constantly stirring the mixture as this will cause the vegetables to break down.  Gently stir, if needed to rotate the potatoes.\n\n**\\*Baking Time:**  We highly recommend using a ceramic/enamel lined Dutch oven with a tightly fitting lid as it intensifies the heat and conducts heat better.  Whenever you are cooking potatoes with tomatoes, the acid from the tomatoes toughens the potatoes’ cellular wall and makes it harder for liquids to penetrate and soften the potatoes.  In other words, it will take longer in the oven for the potatoes than one might traditionally think.  We have had Readers tell us that when they **don’t use** a Dutch oven that it has taken up to 75 to 90 minutes for their potatoes to soften.  Additionally, constantly opening the oven door loses temperature in the oven adding additional time for the potatoes to soften.\n\n**\\*Sea Salt:**  Please adjust the sea salt based upon your family’s sea salt preferences and/or based upon dietary needs.\n\n**\\*Serving:**  Makes 4-5 servings.\n\n**\\*Storage:**  Refrigerate and use within 5 days.\n\n![](https://monkeyandmekitchenadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AmeeraRobinSignoff.png)\n\n_This post contains affiliate links, and we may receive a very small commission if you purchase through those links at no additional cost to you.

Start by preparing your vegetables. Feel free to add or adjust the recipe to include your favorite veggies!\n\n*   **_Prep:_** Wash the vegetables and pat them dry, then section into large pieces. Cut the zucchini and mushrooms in half, then section the bell pepper into larger chunks. The red onion can be cut into thick rings.\n*   _**Season:**_ Place all the sliced vegetables onto a tray and drizzle them generously with olive oil. The oil will help the seasonings stick and helps the veggies grill better. Add all the seasonings and spices next: salt, pepper, paprika, thyme and rosemary.\n*   _**Preheat**_ an indoor grill pan over medium-high heat or an outdoor grill to 500F. Once the grill grates are super hot, add the vegetables in a single layer onto the hot grill. If using an outdoor grill, close the grill for faster cooking.\n*   _**Grill the veggies**_ for 3 to 4 minutes per side, turning once to cook on the other side for the same amount of time. Green zucchini takes a little longer, about 5 minutes per side.\n\n![grilled vegetables with zesty garlic dressing](https://tatyanaseverydayfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Garlic-Grilled-Veggie-Salad-2-768x1024.jpg)\n\nMaking the Cilantro Garlic Dressing\n-----------------------------------\n\nOnce the vegetables are grilled, remove them from the grill and onto a large tray. Using a sharp knife, cut the grilled veggies into bit sized pieces. Place the chopped grilled veggies into a large mixing bowl and prepare the garlic dressing! This zesty and refreshing dressing is made with loads of freshly minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and chopped cilantro. Just mix the ingredients in a small bowl or measuring cup.\n\nAssembling the Grilled Vegetable Salad\n--------------------------------------\n\nOnce you have the vegetables grilled and the salad dressing ready to go, it’s easy to assemble the salad!\n\n1.  Once the vegetables are grilled, remove them from the grill and onto a large tray. Using a sharp knife, cut all of the grilled veggies into bit sized pieces or chunks. Place the chopped grilled veggies into a large mixing bowl.\n2.  Pour the prepared dressing over the vegetables and use two large spoons to toss everything together! Enjoy this grilled vegetable salad while it’s warm!\n3.  Keep any leftovers refrigerated.

But the combination of roasted potatoes, tart dried cranberries and toasted pecans always feels so quintessentially “fall” to me. And when combined with fresh peppery arugula, creamy avocado, tangy goat cheese (or whatever cheese you love best), and a zippy lemon dressing, this salad hits the perfect balance between cozy and hearty yet still fresh and light, which feels just perfect for these sometimes-warm, sometimes-cool days we’re enjoying right now as we move into the new season ahead.\n\nHere in our house, we most often serve this as an entrée salad, but it would also make a lovely side dish for a dinner or holiday meal if you’d like.

We’ll then dice them into 1/2-inch cubes, toss with olive oil, season generously with salt and pepper, and roast until tender.\n*   **Greens:** I’m partial to the peppery flavor of fresh arugula in this salad, but you could also use baby kale (or other varieties of kale), baby spinach, or any other salad greens that you prefer.\n*   **Avocado:** Feel free to dice or thinly slice the avocado, which adds a lovely creaminess to the salad.\n*   **Crumbled cheese:** I love the tart and tangy flavor of goat cheese in this salad, but feta, blue, cheddar, or Manchego cheese would be delicious alternatives too.\n*   **Nuts:** Just about any of your favorite nuts or seeds will work well in this salad — pecans, walnuts, almonds, pepitas, you choose!\n*   **Dried berries:** Dried cranberries always feel so quintessentially fall-ish to me, but dried cherries, raisins or even apricots would work well too.\n*   **Dressing:** My [everyday salad dressing](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/salad-dressing/) goes beautifully with this salad, made with a quick blend of olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, garlic, salt and pepper.\n\n![Step by step instructions for how to make favorite fall salad](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fall-Salad-Collage.jpg \"This roasted sweet potato salad is tossed with creamy avocado, dried cranberries, goat cheese (or feta or blue), arugula, toasted pecans and a quick lemon vinaigrette.

I had to hold myself back from climbing in the oven with it after the twenty minute mark. It was a little less Sylvia Plath and a little more was more “_LET ME AT THAT SQUASH!_” I may have stolen a few cubes to munch on when I added the cranberries. _So good!_\n\n![Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta - This sweet and savory side dish is perfect for the holidays and loaded with Fall flavor!](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/honey-roasted-butternut-squash-cranberries-feta-recipe-thanksgiving-0245-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 3 lb large butternut squash (peeled + chopped)\n*   ▢ 1-2 TBSP [extra virgin olive oil](https://amzn.to/2QvhPq6)\n*   ▢ salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste\n*   ▢ 1-2 cups fresh cranberries (add a little, or a lot!)\n*   ▢ 2-3 TBSP honey plus extra to taste\n*   ▢ ¼ cup finely crumbled feta\n*   ▢ ground cinnamon to taste \n*   ▢ fresh or dried parsley to garnish, optional\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F.\n    \n*   Lightly drizzle or spritz a baking sheet with olive oil.\n    \n*   Add cubed squash to the sheet along with another drizzle of olive oil.\n    \n*   Sprinkle with a light layer of salt, pepper, and garlic powder, based on taste preference.\n    \n*   Roast at 400 F for 25 minutes on the center rack.\n    \n*   At the 25 minute mark, pull out the oven rack, and add your fresh cranberries to the roasting pan.\n    \n*   Return to the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cranberries have started to soften and burst a bit, resembling really juicy craisins vs fresh firm cranberries.\n    \n*   Remove from oven and add a sprinkle of cinnamon (approx. 1/8-1/4 tsp depending on preference) along with feta and honey. I listed the honey measurements I used, but depending on whether you used fresh cranberries or dried, sweeten to taste.\n    \n*   Garnish with parsley for a burst of color and dig in while it's hot!\n    \n\nFeel free to use fresh or dried cranberries for this dish.\n\nDried will be sweeter, while fresh with have a delightful punch of tartness to pair with the buttery squash and sweet honey.

I still bake with it because it’s an awesome natural sweetener and I adore it so, but if I have the option to keep it as close to raw as possible, I do. Hence adding the honey after roasting the squash and cranberries in this recipe. The fruit and veggie medley is still just warm enough to allow the honey to cover the dish as a deliciously sweet glaze, but not so scorching that it’s spending 30+ minutes in my oven losing all it’s fabulous benefits.\n\n_File this under things I tell myself so I can eat more honey._\n\nIf you’re as squash obsessed as I am right now, you should totally take your Fall/Winter menu up a few notches and try my [Cheesy Garlic Parmesan Spaghetti Squash](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/09/cheesy-garlic-parmesan-spinach-spaghetti-squash.html) and Butternut Cauliflower Soup.\n\nSO DELICIOUS!\n\nIf you get a chance to try this Honey Roasted Butternut Squash with Cranberries and Feta, let me know!\n\nYou can leave me a comment here (LOVE checking those daily!) or tag @PEASandCRAYONS #PEASANDCRAYONS on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peasandcrayons) so I can happy dance over your creations!

I’ve done some experimenting and here’s what I’ve got so far!\n\nI’ve found the best advance-prep results were when I pre-roasted the squash for around 25-30 minutes and then before serving, I tossed the room temperature squash back in the oven along with the cranberries for an additional 10 minutes or so until the cranberries started to burst and the squash crisped back up around the edges (yet still creamy and buttery on the inside!). I reheated it in the oven just before serving so the feta and honey were added to the still-warm dish and it worked great!\n\nI have also cooked the squash and berries in their entirety and popped them in the fridge. I let it come to room temp for a bit then reheated them in the oven for around 10 minutes before serving, adding the cheese/honey after as well. The first method had more of the texture I was looking for but the results from this method were still good!\n\nLet me know if you find another method that works great for you as well!\n\nLast year I even slapped the leftover honey roasted butternut squash with cranberries on an epic Thanksgiving leftover sandwich (with all the fixings) and it was amazing!\n\nPeas and Crayons is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites at no cost to readers.\n\n[![Jenn Laughlin Headshot Photo - About the Author](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jenn-laughlin-headshot-peasandcrayons--scaled-e1716318471546-600x600.jpg)](https://peasandcrayons.com/about)\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nJenn Laughlin\n-------------\n\nJenn Laughlin created Peas and Crayons in 2009 after graduating with B.S. in Dietetics from Florida State University while working as a Nutrition Educator for WIC.

To make Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.\n\nOn your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine. \n\nNow, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce2-e1541953299325.jpg)\n\nAfter that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce10-e1541953546118.jpg)\n\nThen roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-e1541953605651.jpg)\n\nUsing your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame.\n\nLightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce remove excess dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-e1541953690862.jpg)\n\nLift your tray and carefully turn upside down on a parchment paper lined baking tray. \n\nThe pumpkin ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. \n\nCollect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of pumpkin raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n\nAdd your fresh pumpkin ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. \n\nsage butter, apples and pecans\n------------------------------\n\nWhile your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat.  You want to stir them often or they will burn. \n\nCook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant.  Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside.\n\nNext, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat.  Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce apples and butter](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-e1541953820985.jpg)\n\nThen add your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 – 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry.\n\nOnce your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumpkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat.  Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n\n**pro tips for perfect pumpkin ravioli**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don’t want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don’t forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can’t emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don’t!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 – 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn’t seem like much but you don’t want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce bowl](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-e1541953937768.jpg)\n\n**can you make ravioli without a pasta machine?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely!

Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don't forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can't emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don't!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 - 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn't seem like much but you don't want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n![](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/400dpiLogoCropped-1024x214.jpg)\n\nServing: 8g | Calories: 426.8kcal | Carbohydrates: 42.6g | Protein: 13.9g | Fat: 23.4g | Saturated Fat: 11.8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 3g | Monounsaturated Fat: 7.3g | Cholesterol: 143mg | Sodium: 723.2mg | Potassium: 164.1mg | Fiber: 3.5g | Sugar: 5.4g | Vitamin A: 3650IU | Vitamin C: 2.6mg | Calcium: 149mg | Iron: 2.4mg\n\n**Update Notes:** This post was originally published in November 2018 but was republished with an updated recipe, new photos, step by step instructions and tips in July of 2020."

All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\n\n![Chickpea, roasted vegetable, and grain salad in a large bowl](https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:eco,c_fill,g_center,w_730,h_913/k%2Farchive%2F34ef39bbfe74b678984b82ea6816b61de2913ab8)\n\nIt’s several days after [Thanksgiving](https://www.thekitchn.com/all-thanksgiving-recipes-22957573), and I’m still very much in holiday eating mode. We ate leftovers for every meal on Friday, switched it up with [tacos](https://www.thekitchn.com/beef-taco-recipe-23020688) on Saturday, and ordered [pizza](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-really-good-pizza-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-178384) on Sunday because we still didn’t feel like cooking. The next few days for lunch will probably be more leftovers, because I can’t see beyond the mountain of plastic-wrapped [mashed potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes-for-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-180434) and [stuffing](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-the-very-best-thanksgiving-stuffing-237564) in the fridge to even try and dig for a fresh vegetable.\n\nWhen I do break free and get back to some type of normalcy, I know exactly what I’ll be eating to help me reset. This vegetarian cauliflower rice bowl is packed with all my favorite healthy foods, and it’s the perfect meal to enjoy throughout December. **It has ingredients of [cauliflower rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/trader-joes-cauliflower-rice-recipes-265085), [sweet potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-sweet-potato-recipes-261990), [pepitas](https://www.thekitchn.com/pepitas-vs-pumpkin-seeds-23416957), [feta cheese](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-feta-recipes-23147049) – all roasts together in the oven, then pile them onto [roasted vegetables](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221).**\n\nThe Cheap & Easy Lunch Bowl I’ll Be Meal Prepping All Month\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter cooking a giant Thanksgiving meal and spending the following days indulging, I want a lunch that’s fresh, healthy, quick to pull together, and easy on the wallet — after all, I have holiday gifts to buy!\n\nThis lunch bowl checks all those boxes. Everything roasts together in the oven: big cubes of [sweet potato](https://www.thekitchn.com/roasted-sweet-potatoes-263158), crunchy pepitas, and even oversized crumbles of feta, which take on this wonderful chewy-creamy texture when warmed. Instead of sautéing the [cauliflower rice](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-cauliflower-rice-couscous-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203344) (buy it pre-riced to save time), you’ll also throw it into the oven. Tossing it with [turmeric](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipes-with-turmeric-223795) gives it a gorgeous golden hue and a slightly earthy flavor.\n\nWhile everything’s roasting, you’ll mix up a fresh bean salad: a [can of chickpeas](https://www.thekitchn.com/chickpea-recipes-234833), a handful of [herbs](https://www.thekitchn.com/your-guide-to-storing-fresh-herbs-in-the-fridge-231412), a drizzle of [olive oil](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-olive-oil-and-extra-virgin-olive-oil-word-of-mouth-218767), and a squeeze of [lime juice](https://www.thekitchn.com/5-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-juice-from-limes-amp-lemons-tips-from-the-kitchn-119886). Pile onto the [roasted veg](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-any-vegetable-101221), then enjoy for lunch right after it’s made or divvy into lunch containers and eat throughout the week. You don’t even need to futz with a dressing — just drizzle with more oil and a squeeze a lime juice before diving in.\n\nThe flexibility of this recipe makes it extra budget-friendly. Use whatever root vegetable you have on hand or is on sale at the grocery store. Buy pepitas in the bulk section, or swap out another nut or seed that’s already stashed in your pantry. It’s delicious any way you make it.\n\n[Comments](#comments-263225)\n\nAn easy, protein-packed vegetarian lunch bowl made with cauliflower rice, sweet potatoes, and a vibrant chickpea salad.\n\n#### Nutritional Info\n\n### Ingredients\n\n*   1 1/2 pounds\n    \n    root vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, or a combination, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes\n    \n*   4 tablespoons\n    \n    olive oil, divided, plus more for serving\n    \n*   1 1/2 teaspoons\n    \n    kosher salt, divided\n    \n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n    \n*   4 ounces\n    \n    feta cheese, drained\n    \n*   1/4 cup\n    \n    pumpkin seeds\n    \n*   3 cups\n    \n    fresh or frozen cauliflower rice, such as Trader Joe's\n    \n*   1/2 teaspoon\n    \n    ground turmeric\n    \n*   1 (15.5-ounce) can\n    \n    chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n    \n*   1/2 cup\n    \n    coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems\n    \n*   Finely grated zest of 2 medium limes\n    \n*   Juice of 2 medium limes, plus more wedges for serving\n    \n*   1\n    \n    medium avocado, pitted and quartered\n    \n\n1.  Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat to 425°F. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, then season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and several grinds of black pepper. Toss to combine, then arrange into an even layer. Roast on the lower rack until beginning to brown, about 20 minutes.\n    \n2.  Flip the sweet potatoes and push them to one side. Add the pumpkin seeds to the now-empty portion of the baking sheet and crumble the feta into large pieces over the sweet potatoes. Place the cauliflower rice (if using frozen, break up any clumps first), turmeric, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and several grinds of black pepper on a second rimmed baking sheet and toss until evenly combined. Spread into an even layer.\n    \n3.  Place the sweet potatoes on the upper rack and the cauliflower rice on the lower rack. Roast until the pumpkin seeds are toasted, the sweet potatoes are golden-brown, and the feta is warmed through, 7 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl and toss until evenly coated; set aside.\n    \n4.  **For each serving:** Transfer 1/4 of the rice, 1/4 of the sweet potato and feta mixture, and 1/4 of the chickpea mixture into a bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the pepitas and top with a piece of the avocado (peel the avocado if eating immediately). Drizzle with more olive oil and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve with a lime wedge.\n    \n\n### Recipe Notes\n\n**Storage:** Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."

Using a meat mallet or the bottom of your fry pan, pound breasts to even thickness (you don't want the meat super-flat, just even in thickness). Place the prepared chicken in a large sealable plastic bag and set aside.\n    \n*   In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon lime zest, 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, minced garlic, honey, cumin, coriander, and salt and pepper (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of each; add to your preference). Once the mixture is well combined, remove 3 tablespoons of the mixture and reserve for later.\n    \n*   Add the rest of the marinade to the bag with the chicken. Seal the bag and then knead with your hands to ensure all of the chicken is well coated. Place in the fridge and marinate for at least 30 minutes and preferably 2-3 hours. Don't marinate longer than 6 hours. (Acid from lime begins to \"cook\" the chicken.)\n    \n*   Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (about 400 degrees F.). Generously oil the grill (I drench a roll-up paper towel in vegetable oil and, holding it with tongs, rub it over the grill grates. Don't skip this step.) Start by grilling the pineapple **(See Note 1)** so you can work on the salsa while the chicken cooks. Rub about 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil over all sides of the pineapple. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until lightly charred (or grilled to your liking). Remove to a plate to allow to slightly cool before dicing.\n    \n*   Remove chicken from marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill the chicken, turning halfway through grilling, about 4-6 minutes per side (until the thickest part of the chicken registers 165 degrees F and juices run clear). Baste the chicken with the reserved marinade as you grill and after flipping. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil, so the juices can re-distribute. Slice thinly or chop into bite-sized pieces.\n    \n*   While the chicken cooks, prepare the salsa. Dice the pineapple, cilantro, jalapeno, and red onion. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the freshly squeezed lime juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. I add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, but add to preference. Gently toss together, taste, and then adjust seasoning if needed. Serve spooned generously over the grilled chicken.\n    \n*   We like to serve Pineapple Chicken with coconut rice or cilantro-lime rice. If you'd like those recipes, check for the links to those recipes right above this recipe card!\n    \n\n**Note** **1**: You don't have to grill the pineapple, but it does add an amazing sweetness (it caramelizes as it grills) to the dish. Check pictures in the post for the size of pineapple to grill. (I cut the cored and peeled the pineapple and cut into about 9 or 10 long strips.) Once grilled, I slice each pineapple strip in 3 long strips and then dice those long strips into small pieces for the salsa. Use a sharp knife here! You will likely have more pineapple salsa than needed to top chicken, but we like a lot--or finish the rest off with chips. You can halve the pineapple salsa recipe, but I like it as written, so I don't waste the rest of the veggies.\n\n**Note 2**: A good, ripe avocado adds a delicious creamy element to this dish. If you don't add avocado and want a creamy element, I'd recommend the [jalapeno sauce from this recipe](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/jamaican-jerk-tacos/).

    "markdown": "# Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts and Spinach - Marisa Moore Nutrition\n _This 20-minute Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts & Spinach is perfect for fall! This creamy pumpkin pasta with toasted walnuts and spinach dish is as flavorful as it is nutritious. Serve it for a fall dinner party or quick weeknight meal._ \n\n![Overhead Pumpkin Pasta with Spinach in bowls with fork](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/522A0433.jpg)\n\nI shared this creamy pumpkin pasta with a room full of people at my “all about pumpkin demo” a couple of weeks ago. Though they loved the smell of it, there were more than a few side-eyes in the room. No one had used pumpkin in pasta before and let’s just say they were skeptical but curious. Well. It was a hit!\n\nMost people said they couldn’t taste the pumpkin. And that’s not surprising. Pumpkin doesn’t have a strong flavor. The flavors we associate with pumpkin usually come from the spices paired with it. There is one major exception. Fresh pumpkin can be incredible when it’s roasted until it’s caramelized and sweet.\n\n[This 20-minute Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts & Spinach is perfect for fall!](https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=This%2020-minute%20Pumpkin%20Pasta%20with%20Toasted%20Walnuts%20%26amp%3B%20Spinach%20is%20perfect%20for%20fall%21%20%23easyrecipes&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarisamoore.com%2Fpumpkin-pasta-toasted-walnuts-spinach%2F&via=marisamoore)\n\nThat’s not what I’m using today. Maybe later. Today, I used leftover canned pumpkin to make a luscious, silky smooth pumpkin pasta sauce that’s full of nutrition. It’s got vitamin C, beta-carotene, and fiber which can help keep the immune system and your skin glowing as the weather starts to cool down.\n\nYou can use any pasta you’d like. For more protein and fiber but without changing the flavor of the dish too much, I suggest using chickpea pasta. I prefer it to whole wheat or some of the other “healthy” pasta options.\n\nIf you’re living on the edge, boil some water and cook some old school, regular white pasta! I’m just being sarcastic. Use the pasta that works for you and your family. Just don’t overcook it.\n\nCan you make a dairy-free pumpkin sauce?\n----------------------------------------\n\nYes. I used a little half and half in this recipe because it adds a lovely texture and richness to the sauce. If you are avoiding dairy, try adding a bit more olive oil and broth instead of milk or cream. This substitution will also make the recipe more of a pantry meal.\n\nThe parmesan is, of course, a nice savory, salty addition. You can leave it out for a vegan recipe. If you find that the recipe needs a little something else, add a little What’s the Deal with Nutritional Yeast? to the sauce and blend until smooth.\n\n![Pumpkin Pasta with Toasted Walnuts and Spinach in bowls with two forks](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Exported-4-2.jpg)\n\nHow to make pumpkin pasta sauce\n-------------------------------\n\nFor the sauce: sauté fresh garlic in olive oil just until fragrant. Add the other ingredients and let it simmer. I found that this sauce tastes better the longer it simmers. It tastes even better the next day, so it’s the perfect pumpkin pasta sauce for meal prep! I stored it in a mason jar and used it throughout the week. It also freezes well on its own.\n\nOnce the pumpkin sauce is ready,  add a couple of large handfuls of baby spinach. Add in the pasta and heat the dish just until all are heated through and the spinach wilts.\n\n![Front view Pumpkin Pasta with Spinach in bowls with fork](https://marisamoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pumpkin-Pasta-with-Spinach-in-bowls-with-fork-at-bottom.jpg)\n\nDish it up and top with roasted walnuts and grated Parmesan to make it pretty and to add extra flavor and texture. This pumpkin pasta dish would be an impressive vegetarian dish to serve at fall dinner parties but it’s also quick and easy enough for a fast weeknight meal.\n\nKids and adults will both love it. It’s also a tasty way to use up any extra canned pumpkin you might have leftover. This recipe will keep in the fridge for about 3 days.\n\nWays to use up leftover canned pumpkin\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you open up a new can of pumpkin for this recipe and need to use up the rest, here are a few [tips for using up leftover pumpkin](https://marisamoore.com/how-to-use-leftover-canned-pumpkin-puree/):\n\n1.  Double this pumpkin pasta sauce recipe. I’m a huge fan of cooking (and cleaning) once and eating twice! You won’t regret having an extra batch of this sauce ready to go in a month.\n2.  Make my easy [homemade pumpkin spice granola](https://marisamoore.com/healthy-pumpkin-spice-granola/)!\n3.  Stir extra pumpkin into oats or Greek yogurt.\n4.  [Feed the extra plain pumpkin to your dog](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/share-your-love-for-pumpkin-with-your-dog-this-fall/). She will love it as is or mixed in with her regular food.

Serve it for a fall dinner party or quick weeknight meal. \n\nPrep Time 5 minutes\n\nCook Time 10 minutes\n\nTotal Time 15 minutes\n\nCourse Entree, Main Course\n\nCuisine American\n\nServings 4 people\n\nCalories 388 kcal\n\n*   ▢ 8 ounces shells or bowtie pasta\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n*   ▢ 2 cloves fresh garlic, minced\n*   ▢ 1 cup pure pumpkin puree (I used canned)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoon tomato paste\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoon half and half (Swap in coconut milk for a vegan sauce.)\n*   ▢ 1 cup vegetable broth\n*   ▢ pinch ground nutmeg\n*   ▢ Cracked black pepper and salt to taste\n*   ▢ 2 cups baby spinach, heaping\n*   ▢ ¼ cup chopped toasted walnuts\n*   ▢ Parmesan cheese (Optional; Use crushed walnuts for a vegan recipe.)\n\n*   Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside but keep it warm.\n    \n*   While the pasta cooks, bring a large skillet to medium heat and add the olive oil and minced garlic. Cook just until fragrant. Whisk in the tomato paste, pumpkin, half and half until smooth. Add the vegetable broth, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Stir until combined. Let cook on low about 5 minutes.\n    \n*   Add the spinach. Cook until it lightly wilts.\n    \n*   Stir in pasta and toss to coat. Sprinkle with walnuts and Parmesan, if desired and serve. \n    \n\n**Tips for making pumpkin pasta sauce:**\n\n*   Adjust the salt based on the broth you use. For example, if you are using a lower sodium broth, add salt to suit your taste!\n*   Store the pasta sauce in a mason jar for a few days. It tastes better the day after you make it!\n*   Reheat the pumpkin sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Add warm broth to help thin it out if needed.\n\nCalories: 388kcal\n\n[Let us know](#comment) how it was!"

This sauce-soaked, herb-loaded wonder is exactly the kind of chicken I like.\n\n![Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken and rice with bite on fork.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-5.jpg)\n\nIt’s the time of year when I start to build my meal plans around getting outdoors as much as possible. I know what’s coming (WINTER) and I know how much I will be outside (HARDLY AT ALL) so I’m doing my best to really lean into those summer flavors and the kinds of meals that naturally bring you outside into the sun. And if those meals can put loads of fresh summer herbs to good use, double win.\n\nFor that reason this recipe serves two purposes:\n\n*   Getting you outside into the sun / fresh air to boost the mood a bit.\n*   Giving you the foundation for all good things: that zingy, salty, herb-loaded coconut lime sauce.\n\n![Coconut lime sauce in a food processor.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-1.jpg)\n\nCoconut milk, lime juice, lime zest, fish sauce, cilantro mint garlic oh my. This. Sauce. Is. So. Good.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that between recipe development, photos, and video, the three people working on this recipe (working out of three separate locations) each ended up with slightly different looking sauces. One thin, one medium, one thick.\n\nThe lesson: coconut milk can vary greatly from can to can and brand to brand, and how much lime sauce you add (and whether you measure or just squeeze) can also impact the final coconut lime sauce texture. I’d recommend just starting with what’s written and then adjust as needed.\n\n![Grilling chicken on a grill.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-2.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the day, chicken and rice never fails, but it EXTRA never fails us when it’s serves as a blank canvas to holds all the flavors of that cool, creamy sauce.\n\nA little char on the chicken, a fresh squeeze of lime, hot sticky rice, and a heavy dousing of puckery coconut lime sauce. It’s creamy and summery, bright and fresh, and deeply filling and satisfying.\n\nBring it on.\n\n![Coconut Lime Grilled chicken with rice on a plate.](https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Coconut-Lime-Chicken-4.jpg)\n\nCheck Out Our Video For How To Make Coconut Lime Grilled Chicken:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### [Click here to see the step-by-step web story instructions for this recipe!](https://pinchofyum.com/web-stories/coconut-lime-grilled-chicken)\n\n_The coconut lime sauce (and the crown jewel!) of this recipe was inspired by the sauce in [this Forbidden Rice salad recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/37302-forbidden-rice-salad-with-thai-coconut-lime-dressing) from Food52. Not one but two people on our team made it and convinced me I needed to try it_! _They were not wrong. The Food52 recipe was authored by Asha Loupy. You can find her website [here](http://fromheadtotable.com/) and her Instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/fromheadtotable/)._\n\n[Print](https://pinchofyum.com/coconut-lime-grilled-chicken-and-rice/print/63743)\n\n### Description\n\nCoconut Lime Grilled Chicken Bowls! Grilled marinated chicken, fluffy rice, and excessive handfuls of mint and cilantro, finished off with a generous drizzling of big and flavorful creamy coconut lime sauce.\n\n* * *\n\n**Coconut Lime Sauce**\n\n*   juice and zest of 2-3 **limes** (about 1/4 cup)\n*   2 tablespoons **fish sauce**\n*   1/4 cup **full fat coconut milk** (solid / creamy stuff in a can for a creamier sauce)\n*   1 tablespoon **brown sugar**\n*   1 tablespoon **lemongrass paste** (or fresh grated lemongrass, if you have access!)\n*   half a **jalapeño pepper**, ribs and seeds removed\n*   1 clove **garlic**\n*   small bundle of **fresh cilantro**\n*   small bundle of **fresh mint**\n\n**Everything Else**\n\n*   1 lb. **boneless skinless chicken thighs**\n*   1 1/2 cups **rice**, uncooked\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\n* * *\n\n1.  Sauce: Pulse all sauce ingredients together in a food processor until smooth.\n    \n2.  Chicken: Pour about half of the sauce over the chicken and allow to marinade for 30 minutes. _(This 30 minute wait time is a good time to make some rice!)_\n    \n3.  Chicken: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high heat. Cook the chicken on both sides until browned and fully cooked, about 4 minutes per side. Allow to rest for a few minutes.\n    \n4.  To finish: Serve grilled chicken with rice and vegetables, and drizzle with remaining sauce.\n    \n\n### Notes\n\n**Sauce Consistency:** The thickness and creaminess of your sauce is pretty dependent on the nature of your coconut milk. There can be so much variance between brands and even just from can to can, which you can see between our Instagram story videos, our photos, and our step by step videos. The good news is that regardless of texture, the sauce tastes \\*delicious.\\* And you can always boost the creaminess by adding more of the top / solid part of the coconut milk into the sauce.\n\n**Vegetarian / Vegan:** Sub 1-2 tablespoons soy sauce for fish sauce, and serve on pan-fried tofu!\n\n*   Prep Time: 20 minutes\n*   Cook Time: 20 minutes\n*   Category: Dinner\n*   Method: Grilling\n*   Cuisine: Thai-Inspired\n\nKeywords: grilled chicken, grilling recipe, grilled chicken thighs, coconut sauce, coconut chicken, healthy summer dinner, rice bowls\n\n* * *\n\nOne More Thing!\n---------------\n\nThis recipe is part of our collection of **[delicious rice recipes](https://pinchofyum.com/delicious-rice-recipes)**.

[This is olive oil](https://amzn.to/3hwcVGc) is generally considered the gold standard for affordable but excellent.  \n**Parmesan:** Freshly grated parmesan is preferred here because it melts and browns extremely nicely, but the bagged pre-shredded stuff works just fine.  \n**Salt & pepper:** You don’t really need more seasoning than a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, but if you’d like to experiment with flavors, try adding a little garlic powder or Italian seasoning.\n\n![Parmesan being sprinkled on zucchini slices before baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-photo.jpg)\n\nHow to Make the Best Baked Parmesan Zucchini (Tips and Tricks)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Be strategic about how you slice your zucchini:** Prefer softer zucchini? Slice it into thinner rounds, around 1/4-inch thick. Like your baked zucchini on the firmer side? Cut it thicker, closer to 1/2-inch.  \n**Don’t skip the broiler:** The final step in this recipe after roasting your zucchini is to switch on the broiler and broil the rounds for just a couple minutes. This makes the cheese extra toasty and delicious. But keep a close eye on your zucchini while the broiler is going. Food under the broiler can burn very quickly, so you never want to leave your broiler unattended.\n\n![Collage photo of parmesan zucchini before and after baking.](https://i2.wp.com/bakingmischief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/baked-parmesan-zucchini-picture.jpg)\n\n### What to Serve With Cheesy Roasted Zucchini?\n\nThese bites are great alongside almost anything, particularly simple lunch sandwiches or:\n\n*   [Tomato Soup](https://bakingmischief.com/easy-tomato-soup-recipe-for-two/)\n*   [Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwiches](https://bakingmischief.com/pesto-grilled-cheese-sandwich/)\n*   [Sausage Pasta](https://bakingmischief.com/creamy-sausage-pasta/)\n*   [Buttered Noodles](https://bakingmischief.com/buttered-noodles/)\n\n**Bonus Tip:** _If you have leftover [Pizza Sauce](https://bakingmischief.com/best-homemade-pizza-sauce/) or marinara sauce in your fridge, serve these as a snack and use them for dipping.

I have a batch of cooked quinoa in my fridge at all times and use it in meatless tacos, enchiladas, and salads. It's a healthy protein source and combined with beans and vegetables makes for a delicious and filling dish.\n\nThis Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad is a family favorite right now! It's simple to make and I can store it in individual containers for a healthy lunch throughout the week or as a side dish to grilled chicken. It's wonderful in lettuce cups or tossed with chopped kale too!\n\nIngredients:\n------------\n\n![sweet potatoes, corn, black beans, red onion and quinoa in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-1.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\n*   **sweet potatoes** - The star of this recipe! I cut the potatoes into chunks, toss them with oil and spices, and roast them.\n*   **quinoa** - You can use my recipe for cooking [quinoa in the Instant Pot](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/) (it takes only 1 minute of cooking time!!) or make it on the stove.\n*   **black beans** - You will need one can or 1 and ½ cups of home-cooked beans.\n*   **whole kernel corn** - You will need one can. Drain the water and rinse the corn before adding to the salad. Fresh is great too and can be roasted along with the potatoes! I do not like frozen and thawed-out corn in this salad\n*   **onion** - I prefer red onion for salads. You can use sweet or yellow, whatever you prefer.\n*   **olive oil** - It's a base for the dressing. Use avocado oil, if you prefer.\n*   **lime juice** - Freshly squeezed juice is best here.\n*   **spices** - cumin, paprika, salt, pepper\n*   **garlic** - I prefer fresh, minced garlic. Use garlic powder if you are in a pinch.\n*   **Tajin seasoning** - This ingredient is not necessary but definitely recommended. It is made with ground dried chile peppers, dehydrated lime, and sea salt.\n\nThis healthy and filling salad is very easy to make. It's perfect for meal prep lunch or dinners, when you want something filling but healthy. Here is how to make it:\n\n*   Start with roasting sweet potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, and cumin. They will have a delicious Mexican flair!\n*   Add one can of rinsed and drained black beans, one can of drained whole kernel corn, chopped red onion, and 2 cups of [cooked quinoa](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/1-minute-instant-pot-quinoa-recipe/).\n*   The dressing is as simple as the salad! Whisk together olive oil, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, and Tajin seasoning. Pour over salad and toss together.\n\n![roasted sweet potato salad in a bowl](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-5.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHow to roast sweet potatoes for this salad?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRoasting sweet potatoes for a salad or as a simple side dish to your meal prep dishes is very easy. Simply peel potatoes and cut them into cubes, no bigger than ½\". Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and ground cumin. Roast at 400 degrees F for 20 to 23 minutes. Use right away or cool and add to your salad. You can also store them in a container with a lid in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n\nThe dressing:\n-------------\n\nI have plenty of salad recipes with creamy dressings, either mayo-based or healthier with sour cream. For this sweet potato salad, I decided to use a simple olive oil vinaigrette that perfectly complements the potatoes, beans, and quinoa. Mix 4 to 5 tablespoons of olive oil with lime juice, salt, cumin, paprika, minced garlic, and tajin seasoning. The last one is optional but I love it in this dressing and even add a little more sprinkled over each serving.\n\n![sweet potato quinoa salad in two bowls with lime wedges](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sweet-potato-quinoa-salad-4.jpg \"Roasted Sweet Potato Black Bean Quinoa Salad Recipe - healthy and filling quinoa salad with cumin roasted sweet potatoes and quick oil and lime vinaigrette. Perfect as a side dish or a healthy lunch!\")\n\nHelpful Tips!\n-------------\n\n*   I love this salad with slightly warm quinoa and warm roasted potatoes but it is absolutely delicious chilled in the fridge and can be divided into serving containers.\n*   If using fresh corn, add it to roasting potatoes. It will give it an even more delicious flavor.\n*   If you don't like raw red onion, skip it. Use a sweet one, if you prefer.\n*   To make the salad ahead, you can keep the dressing separate in a bottle and toss it with all the ingredients before serving.\n\nMore salad recipes:\n-------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Black Bean Taco Salad Recipe\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/black-bean-taco-salad-recipe/)\n*   [\n    \n    Chickpea Quinoa Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/chickpea-quinoa-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Fresh Corn Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/fresh-corn-salad/)\n*   [\n    \n    Easy Broccoli Salad\n    \n    ](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/quick-and-easy-broccoli-salad-recipe/)\n\n[![](https://www.crunchycreamysweet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pin-it-button.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/59883870031914544/)\n\n__If you like this recipe and make it,_ **_let me know in the comments_** _below!

The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.\n\n* * *\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\nYield:4 servings\n\n*   1pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)\n*   1lemon\n*   4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n*   Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper\n*   ½teaspoon red-pepper flakes\n*   1(18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi\n*   6tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces\n*   ½teaspoon honey\n*   Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving\n\n[Ingredient Substitution Guide](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/79-substitutions-for-cooking)\n\n##### Nutritional analysis per serving (4 servings)\n\n526 calories; 33 grams fat; 13 grams saturated fat; 0 grams trans fat; 15 grams monounsaturated fat; 2 grams polyunsaturated fat; 52 grams carbohydrates; 8 grams dietary fiber; 5 grams sugars; 11 grams protein; 697 milligrams sodium\n\nNote: The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.

Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)\n    \n2.  In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.\n    \n3.  In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.\n    \n\nRatings\n-------\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\nor to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\n### Private Notes\n\nLeave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.\n\nCooking Notes\n-------------\n\nDear NY Times stylist, thanks for using my father's, Michael Lax's, teak handled, cast iron, skillet, the large one, by Copco. Great skillets, but note, if you find one, due to the selection of the teak handle, you cannot put them into the oven. My father was an industrial designer and designed/started Copco. The NYTimes ran his obituary in 1999. He was a diehard New Yorker, born and raised in the west village on Morton Street and he went to Alfred University in the Industrial Ceramics dept.\n\nRather than honey, I substituted a splash of aged balsamic for sweetness as well as a touch of acidity.\n\nThis works great with the Trader Joe’s Cauliflower Gnocchi too.\n\nThis was so good! We roasted the brussel sprouts to make them really crispy and then added them to the skillet along with a shallot and chopped garlic after crisping the gnocchi. Also topped it with a dollop of lemon zested garlic ricotta to finish. It was over the top delicious!\n\nI guess I'm the only whose brussel sprouts didn't cook in five minutes. I tried to follow this using the timing but ended up with hard brussel sprouts so I had to add liquid and let it simmer\n\nFabulous! Life required that I roast the sprouts. I prepared as directed with lemon zest and red pepper flakes. My helper popped them in oven at 425. They cooked for 25 minutes to perfection. By time I got home, I had enough time to prepare gnocchi as directed before roasting was complete.. I had to make 2 batches for crowd I was feeding - first one used 6 T butter, second batch 4T. Four was plenty. Used balsamic instead of honey. Will make again and again !\n\nI have done this with pancetta rather than butter. It's fantastic, and it also would be almost as good with butter..\n\nMade this into a true 20 min meal by baking the Brussels sprouts in the oven (15 min at 450 degrees) while simultaneously cooking the gnocchi on the stove top. Mixed them together on stovetop at the very end as recipe says. Also, 6 tablespoons of butter seems crazy - I added 2 and my gnocchi were deliciously buttery and crispy! Quick and easy, would definitely make again.\n\nMy kids only dabbled in the brussels sprouts (understandable, and: more veggies for me!), but mainly stuck to the gnocchi. My wife - hates \"cabbage-y\" things - was astonished by how good it was. In my family, this counts as a success. However: - This took much more than 20 minutes, more like 40. - I rounded up on the portions (I live in Europe and buy in grams). Nonetheless, there weren't any leftovers. Feeds four? Feeds two adults and two toddlers. Well.\n\nIf the gnocchi immediately sticking to the pan like glue freaks you out like it did me the first time, don’t worry. It will release once the butter melts (and with a nice golden brown crust). Do make sure they are completely broken up before they go into the pan though.\n\nFollowed exactly, except my sprouts were big so I quartered them. It took more than 2 min for the butter to brown but once it did, magic. Don’t skimp on the lemon zest and don’t be afraid of some bigger chunks of it after chopping — fried in the butter and honey they are a delightful contrast to the rest of the dish. Don’t overdo the Parmesan at the end, a light sprinkle does the job.\n\nWhy decide between Pancetta and Butter when you can have both?!? One of the best things I’ve cooked at home in recent memory.\n\nCooked this last night and it was delicious. Next time I would double the Brussels sprouts and roast them instead of frying (my pan isn't big enough to properly fry that many sprouts!), try reducing the amount of butter by half (there was so much butter pooled at the bottom of my bowl when we finished it off!), then add the roasted sprouts into the pan to toss with the gnocchi at the very end. We didn't add the Parm because I was lazy and didn't bring it to the table, and didn't miss it one bit!\n\nI think some aged balsamic might be a good substitute for the honey.\n\nWe loved this one! I think the secret is a cast-iron skillet. This was the first recipe I’ve ever attempted in my cast-iron, and I am now a believer! I would probably throw in some bacon next time. And a handful of toasted pinenuts.\n\nLove this recipe! I did sub the honey and red pepper flakes with Mike's Hot Honey and added some rotisserie chicken to the mix.\n\nUsed pancetta (why not?) and was somehow lacking lemon, so used orange zest instead, which was honestly fantastic. What a lovely, tasty one skillet meal.\n\nThis is one of our absolute favorites! I use Brussels Sprouts and cut down the butter a bit. A regular in our house and often doubled (even for only 2 people) to have plenty of leftovers.\n\nDidn’t expect this to work so well but it was superb - like others, perhaps doesn’t need quite that much butter… Brussels Sprouts in a fry pan - awesome trick… Gnocchi in a frypan - awesome trick…. Put them together - amazing meal!\n\nI used chickpea gnocchi for added protein- A delicious dish!\n\nOven roasted the sprouts Halved the butter Added drizzle of lemon juice to the gnocchi at the end\n\nI think I messed this up. It was delicious but messy and super gooey. The brussel sprouts were fantastic but the gnocchi were gooey. Maybe I got the wrong kind? Definitely would try again and see about adding less butter. I was left with lots of extra butter in the pan. I also added mushrooms cause I love them but they probably added extra liquid.\n\nDelicious! For those saying the brussels don’t cook, cover them first while they’re browning. We added a bit of pancetta since we had it and needed to use it up. And why not. Just cooked that first then added the brussels and carried on. Decrease the salt if you do this. We also added more red pepper since we like it. This was absolutely amazing. Half way through eating, we decided to also squeeze some lemon on some of it, and it really gave a nice lift. Make this!\n\nI'm obsessed with this recipe! Sometimes I substitute tteok (Korean rice cakes) for the gnocchi and it takes it to a whole different level.\n\nI added hot Italian sausage and nixed the lemon zest. Hot honey and a drizzle of balsamic glaze at the end and it was absolutely delicious! The timing definitely took a bit longer than what the recipe suggests, but definitely worth it!\n\nLove it, we have made this 50+ times with the following changes: 1. Roast sprouts @ 425F. The listed method is not enough time to cook all the way thru. Add them after browning butter. Protip: Preheat your baking pan! They should sizzle on contact 2. Use 4-5 tbsp butter instead of 6 3. Add 2-3 cloves minced garlic 1 min from done 4. Sub honey for hot honey\n\nThis has become a staple in our house. We have made it over 50 times at this point. But we have evolved the recipe into our own so here are my recommendations: 1. Roast your brussels sprouts cut side down @ 425F instead of sautéing. The listed method is not enough time to cook all them all the way through. Toss them in after you brown the butter. Protip: preheat your baking pan, sprouts should sizzle immediately on contact 2. Let the gnocchi get browned on all sides 3. Add a couple cloves of min\n\nVery surprised by all the positive reviews. Both dry (notice lack of any sauce other than…butter) and extremely greasy (see previous note re: butter). If I try again might boil the gnocchi prior to frying to see if it adds some moisture, halve the butter, and double the ratio of Brussels to gnocchi.\n\nThis dish had no right to be as delicious as it was! The ingredients are simple and so are the techniques you use. It doesn't all make sense on paper but it comes together wonderfully! Crunchy gnocchi and brussel sprouts. Slightly hot from the red pepper flakes, a little sweet from the honey, and with the slightest hint of lemon. And the parmesan at the end! So subtle but so good! Definitely making this again and can't wait to try with the different variations of cruciferous vegetables!\n\nPrivate notes are only visible to you."

    "markdown": "# Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash - Dishing Out Health\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please read our [disclosure policy](https://dishingouthealth.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n_Quinoa Power Bowls with Maple Chipotle Brussels and Smoky Butternut Squash are perfect for meal prep or weeknight dinner. Vegan, gluten free, and equal parts nutritious and delicious._ ![Quinoa and roasted veggies in a bowl](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls2.jpg)\n\nThese bowls truly have it all: protein, fiber, heart-healthy fats, and a slew of micronutrients. And you can totally customize the ingredients to include any produce or grain you have on hand.\n\nThe recipes features maple chipotle brussels sprouts and smoky butternut squash, which make the most fabulous duo. It’s the combination of smoky, sweetness, and spice that add layers of flavor. However you can also use sweet potato, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots.\n\nAs far as the sauce, I keep it simple with a honey-Dijon vinaigrette. It’s actually a staple sauce over here that requires minimal ingredients and is super versatile. However in lieu of the sauce, you can add a dollop of hummus or your favorite bottled dressing instead.![Ingredients in bowls](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowlsIngredients.jpg)\n\nIngredients and Substitutions\n-----------------------------\n\nThese bowls encourage the use of whatever you have on hand, however here’s the general matrix:\n\n*   **Quinoa:** A complete source of plant-based protein, quinoa forms the foundation of these bowls. You can also brown rice, farro, barley, or whatever your go-to grain is.\n*   **Veggies:** The recipe calls for Brussels sprouts, which you can sub for broccoli or cauliflower, and butternut squash. If you’re unable to find butternut squash, you can use sweet potato instead.\n*   **Spices/Seasonings:** Smoked paprika, adobe sauce, and maple syrup create the coveted sweet and spicy flavor profile. Suitable subs for adobo sauce include harissa paste or gochujang, both of which offer red chili goodness.\n*   **Kale:** This sturdy green gets mixed right into the quinoa to bulk up the base of these bowls. If you’re not a fan of kale, feel free to use fresh spinach instead.\n*   **Avocado:** You can’t beat the one-two punch of heart-healthy fats and fiber!\n*   **Honey-Dijon Dressing:** A mix of EVOO, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard create this simple, supremely delicious dressing.\n\n![Quinoa and veggies in a bowl with dressing](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Quinoa Power Bowls:\n-------------------------------\n\nThese bowls are perfect for prepping in advance, and stay good up to 3 or 4 days. Here’s how to make them:\n\n### Step 1: Roast the Brussels Sprouts and Butternut Squash\n\nToss the Brussels with olive oil, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and salt, and spread evenly on a baking sheet. On a separate baking sheet, toss butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Arrange in a single layer, and bake for 25 minutes, tossing once halfway through.\n\n### Step 2: Cook Quinoa in Vegetable Broth\n\nWhile the veggies, prepare the quinoa and kale mixture. To start, combine quinoa and vegetable broth in a small saucepan and bring to a low boil. Next, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cook is fluffy and liquid is absorbed. Remove the lid and stir in kale, which will quickly wilt from the residual heat.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Honey-Dijon Dressing\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey (or maple syrup), apple cider vinegar, and salt. Stir with a whisk until smooth.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Bowls\n\nStart by dividing the quinoa and kale mixture evenly into each of 4 bowls. Next, divide the roasted veggies evenly overtop, and finish with a drizzle of dressing. Lastly, add your garnishes of choice, and dig in!![Roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash on sheet pans](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinoaPowerBowlsCollage.jpg)  \n![Cooked quinoa in a pan with kale](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls3.jpg)\n\nQuinoa Bowl Toppings\n--------------------\n\nI’m ALL about garnishes, and basically live by “the sky is the limit” mantra. Here are some of my favorite toppings for these Quinoa Power Bowls:\n\n*   Slices of **ripe avocado**.\n*   **Chopped nuts or seeds**, such as cashews, pine nuts, or sunflower seeds.\n*   **Spices** such as sumac, crushed red pepper flakes, or za’atar.\n*   A dollop of **hummus**, sprinkle of **feta or goat cheese**, or **nutritional yeast**.\n*   A drizzle of **tahini** or your favorite bottled dressing or sauce.\n\nHow Long do Quinoa Bowls Last?\n------------------------------\n\nThese bowls last up to 3 or 4 days refrigerated (even with the dressing added!). The vegetables, grains, and greens are sturdy enough to be chilled and reheated without going sad and soggy.\n\nSo, feel free to make a double batch and enjoy on repeat for meal prep lunches!![Roasted veggies in a bowl with sliced avocado](https://dishingouthealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QuinaPowerBowls4.jpg)If you give this recipe a try, be sure to snap a pic and tag #dishingouthealth on Instagram so I can see your creations.

Seared chicken, fresh mozzarella and tomato halves, creamy avocado slices and shredded basil leaves are drizzled with an incredible balsamic **dressing that doubles as a marinade** for the ultimate salad!\n\nBalsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad… Now THIS was and still is a family favourite!\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-301.jpg)\n\nWith so many Caprese recipes making their way onto Cafe Delites, like our [Caprese Grilled Cheese](https://cafedelites.com/caprese-grilled-cheese/) and [Grilled Chicken Cypress with Buffalo Mozzarella](https://cafedelites.com/grilled-chicken-caprese/), this salad has been a long time coming. My list of recipes is getting so out of control, I’ve made the extremely difficult decision to STAHP adding to it, and actually start COOKING from it. Best. Decision. Ever. And I have a feeling this salad is going to be your next favourite. Because who doesn’t love Balsamic Chicken AND Caprese _in the one sentence?_\n\n### How To Make The Best Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad\n\nTraditionally, Caprese salads do not contain any balsamic vinegar OR avocados or chicken, but today, however, that has changed to make way for this bowl of epic flavours.\n\nTaking some inspiration from this [Balsamic Glazed Caprese Chicken](https://cafedelites.com/balsamic-glazed-caprese-chicken-recipe/), you’re first going to marinade your chicken:\n\n*   You only need to use 4 tablespoons of the balsamic marinade.\n*   You’re going to reserve the **remaining dressing to use later in the refrigerator!** _No_, we don’t use the OLD marinade as a dressing. We use the _FRESH UNTOUCHED_ marinade.\n*   Then, you’re going to sear said chicken until crispy on the edges and golden. For this salad I used boneless, skinless thighs, BUT you can use breasts if you wish.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-1.jpg)\n\nAfter that, the salad comes together _so FAST_. Throw all ingredients into a bowl and dress with the reserved dressing.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-16.jpg)\n\nJuicy, golden balsamic chicken………fresh grape or cherry tomatoes……fresh baby mozzarella balls (or bocconcini).\n\n### Substitutions\n\n*   You can use cherry tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes, or use chopped Roma tomatoes.\n*   Fresh mozzarella balls are best in this. You can use any size if you can’t find mini.\n*   Romaine, butter, ice berg or spinach are all fine to use as the base.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-20.jpg)![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-19.jpg)\n\nSay hello to your new favourite salad.\n\n![Balsamic Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad | https://cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Balsamic-Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-21.jpg)\n\nIf you love this salad, you’ll love this [BLT Balsamic Chicken Avocado & Feta Salad](https://cafedelites.com/blt-balsamic-chicken-avocado-feta-salad/) OR this [Grilled Lemon Herb Mediterranean Chicken Salad](https://cafedelites.com/grilled-lemon-herb-mediterranean-chicken-salad-recipe/)!\n\n#### WATCH THIS Chicken Avocado Caprese Salad BEING MADE RIGHT HERE!\n\n  \n\n![](https://cafedelites.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chicken-Avocado-Caprese-Salad-301-1-200x200.jpg)\n\n### Marinade/Dressing:\n\n*   ▢ ¼ cup (60 mL) balsamic vinegar\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons (30 mL) olive oil\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons brown sugar\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon minced garlic\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon dried basil\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon salt\n\n### Salad:\n\n*   ▢ 4 chicken thigh fillets, skin removed (no bone)\\*\n*   ▢ 5 cups Romaine, (or cos) lettuce leaves, washed and dried\n*   ▢ 1 avocado, sliced\n*   ▢ 1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced\n*   ▢ ½ cup mini mozzarella / bocconcini cheese balls\n*   ▢ ¼ cup basil leaves, thinly sliced\n*   ▢ Salt and pepper, to season\n\n*   Whisk marinade ingredients together to combine.

volcano](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce-2-e1541953225178.jpg)\n\nNext, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano.\n\n(If your eggs escape, it’s fine, you’re just going to move on to the next step in a bit more hurried fashion 🙂 )\n\nNow, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture.\n\nOnce the dough starts to look like … dough …. start kneading it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThen form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce ravioli

that hour has passed, make your pumpkin ravioli filling by combining ricotta and pumpkin in a large mixing bowl. \n\nAdd in the Parmesan, egg, garlic powder, brown sugar and spices and mix to combine and set aside.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filling](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce3-e1541953358421.jpg)\n\nNow comes the fun part!\n\nOn your counter top or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball. \n\nThrow some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out.\n\nUsing a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide.\n\nAt this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce dough on a tray](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-685x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce7-e1541953425371.jpg)\n\nGently move your dough to lightly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce press tray ](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce8-e1541953484198.jpg)\n\nGently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your pumpkin filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.\n\nIt takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce filled

roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. \n\nTake your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce sealing the ravioli](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce16-e1541953605651.jpg)\n\nUsing your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame.\n\nLightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce remove excess dough](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce12-e1541953690862.jpg)\n\nLift your tray and carefully turn upside down on a parchment paper lined baking tray. \n\nThe pumpkin ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other. \n\nCollect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of pumpkin raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.\n\nAdd your fresh pumpkin ravioli to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. \n\nsage butter, apples and pecans\n------------------------------\n\nWhile your ravioli is cooking, add chopped walnuts to a small pan and toast over medium high heat.  You want to stir them often or they will burn. \n\nCook for 3-4 minutes or until they become fragrant.  Once they are toasted remove from heat and set aside.\n\nNext, add butter to a large skillet and melt over medium high heat.  Add in your diced apple and apple cider vinegar and cook for 2 – 3 minutes.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce apples and butter](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce17-e1541953820985.jpg)\n\nThen add your chopped fresh sage and cook for 2 – 3 minutes so that it starts to sizzle and fry.\n\nOnce your ravioli has cooked, drain the water and add the pumpkin ravioli to the sage butter and stir to coat.  Serve immediately and top with toasted walnuts.\n\n**pro tips for perfect pumpkin ravioli**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   Roll your dough out thin but not too thin.  You don’t want your dough to not stand up to the filling and the boiling process.\n*   Glass cutting boards are a dough rollers best friend.  I will screw up rolling out dough on my counter top EVERY. TIME. Glass cutting boards are a must have in my house.\n*   Don’t forget to spray your ravioli tray and the underside of the press tray with non-stick cooking spray.  Can’t emphasize this enough.\n*   You will want to pack in spoonfuls of your delicious pumpkin ravioli filling in your tiny little ravioli wells.  Stop Drop and Roll right here! Don’t!!!  Fill your pumpkin ravioli with approximately 2 – 3 teaspoons of filling.  I know it doesn’t seem like much but you don’t want your ravioli exploding when you cook them.  Those seams need to be sealed up tight and too much filling will push out and you wont get a tight seal.\n\n[![Pumpkin Ravioli in Apple Sage Butter Sauce bowl](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-682x1024.jpg)](https://www.awickedwhisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pumpkin-Ravioli-in-Apple-Sage-Butter-Sauce19-2-e1541953937768.jpg)\n\n**can you make ravioli without a pasta machine?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely!

Serve with apple slices and graham crackers! This is perfect as a holiday appetizer or the star of your cheeseboard!_\n\n![Maple Pecan Baked Brie - delicious melty brie topped with a maple, brown sugar, and pecan mixture. Serve with apple slices and graham crackers! Perfect holiday appetizer!](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/656/22096333500_cf9afdaf00_c.jpg)\n\nThis maple pecan baked brie is my alltime favorite appetizer for parties, especially holiday parties. It looks so pretty on a cheeseboard surrounded by sliced baguette, fruits, and other cheeses.\n\nAnd it’s also really easy to make. It’s as easy as putting a few toppings on top of the brie and baking until the cheese has melted!\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   **Brie cheese** – you want the round brie and leave the rind on so the cheese stays in while it bakes.\n*   **Maple syrup**\n*   **Brown sugar**\n*   **Cinnamon**\n*   **Pecans** – you can use walnuts if you prefer\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\n*   **Warm the brie.** Place brie on a small baking sheet. Bake at 350F for about 15 minutes or until softened. Remove and let cool for about 5 minutes.\n*   **Make topping.** While the brie cools, heat maple syrup, brown sugar, and cinnamon over low heat in a small saucepan. Stir until the sugar has dissolved; stir in pecans.\n*   **Assemble.** Pour over the brie and serve immediately.\n\n![Maple Pecan Baked Brie - delicious melty brie topped with a maple, brown sugar, and pecan mixture.

Perfect holiday appetizer!](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/765/22284903665_96d55d8756_c.jpg)\n\nWhere To Buy Brie\n-----------------\n\nYou can find brie at any large grocery store. It’s usually not with the shredded cheese but most stores will have a “fancy cheese” section near the deli and that’s where you can find it.\n\nIf you are having trouble finding it, check Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods – both should definitely have it.\n\nCan You Make It Ahead?\n----------------------\n\nBaked brie should not be made ahead. It’s best when served really hot so the brie is still gooey and dippable.\n\nWhat To Serve with Baked Brie\n-----------------------------\n\nMy favorite things to serve with baked brie is sliced baguette, graham crackers, and apple slices.\n\nYou could really do any sort of cookie, cracker, or fruit though. I think strawberries and crisp grapes would be delicious with this particular baked brie.\n\nI also think it goes great with a dry white wine if you are looking for drink options!\n\nHow To Reheat\n-------------\n\nYou can warm up leftover baked brie at a low temp (300F or so) in the oven or even in the microwave. You aren’t trying to cook it, just get it back to it’s melted, dippable state.\n\nCan You Freeze It?\n------------------\n\nI don’t recommend you try freezing this baked brie. Once it’s baked, it will probably be a mess to try to contain and freeze.\n\n![Maple Pecan Baked Brie - delicious melty brie topped with a maple, brown sugar, and pecan mixture.

A must when we are entertaining.

Whenever we have people over, whether we are cooking up the most elaborate or the most simple of meals – this side dish stunner is my go-to.\n\nCooking up the potatoes first allows them to soften up a bit, so when they hit the grilled glistening with the Terra Delyssa olive oil, they get a golden brown char to the outside of them, while still holding their shape.\n\nTry substituting baby spinach, kale or other lettuces or greens for the arugula and even play with different vinaigrette moves, try adding in a whole grain mustard, a little lemon zest, maybe add some red pepper flakes.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4033/35268830450_4839d6d915_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/35268830450/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\nMy go-to herbs are chives and oregano but you can mix those up too, scallions instead of chives, rosemary or thyme instead of oregano. The pine nuts are a bonus crunch, but chopped walnuts or almond slices are great, too.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4238/34846902403_a59f974249_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/34846902403/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\nI promise after the first time you make a grilled potato salad, you will see all the possibilities and be hooked on it throughout the summer, as we are.\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2771/5790346911_4da5eee204_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/5790346911 \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs by Tasty Yummies, on Flickr\")\n\n[![Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4238/34846902403_a59f974249_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tastyyummies/34846902403/ \"Grilled Potato and Arugula Salad with Fresh Herbs\")\n\n![](https://tasty-yummies.com/wp-content/uploads/35487278482_5d3502c49f_c-368x368.jpg)\n\n*   1 ½ to 2 pounds organic Yukon gold potatoes, red bliss potatoes also work\n*   1 bunch fresh arugula, regular, baby or wild\n*   4 tablespoons [Terra Delyssa Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil](http://www.terradelyssa.com/product/get/tplParam/3/language/en), divided\n*   2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar\\*\n*   2 cloves garlic, finely minced (1 small shallot thinly finely chopped is really nice instead of/or in addition to)\n*   ¼ cup finely chopped fresh chives\n*   ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh oregano\n*   1 ½ teaspoons sea salt\n*   ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to taste\n*   ¼ cup toasted pine nuts, optional\n\n*   Using a mandoline slicer, evenly slice the potatoes into 1/4\" slices, skin left on. If you do not have a mandoline slicer, you can cut them by hand, just be sure they are all similar thickness so they cook evenly.\n    \n*   Place the potato slices in a medium saucepan and cover with water, add a dash of salt. Bring them to a boil over a high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer potatoes until just fork tender, about 5-8 minutes once boiling.\n    \n*   Drain the potatoes and rinse in cold water to stop them from cooking.\n    \n*   Once cooled and drained, gently toss with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil (you need just enough to coat all the potatoes, but you don't want too much or it'll cause a flare up on the grill), and a dash each of salt and pepper, so they are all evenly coated.\n    \n*   Preheat the grill to medium-high. Add the potatoes to a nonstick grill pan, basket or wok, and place on the grill over the flames. Since the potatoes will not be in a single layer, you will want to toss them gently and often so some don't burn while others don't get browned. It will take approximately 20 minutes to cook all of the potatoes thoroughly and for them to be nicely browned. If any get caught in a hot spot and cook too quickly or begin to burn a bit, I just remove them early. If you don't want to mess with a grill basket or pan, you can cut the potatoes the long way and cook them directly on your grill in a single layer, this takes only about 5 minutes per side. (Our grill's grates are a bit too wide and we lose too many this way, so to avoid frustration we go with the pan).\n    \n*   While the potatoes are cooking, in a small bowl add the rice wine vinegar, the remaining Terra Delyssa olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, salt and pepper, mix well to combine.\n    \n*   Once the potatoes are cooked, place them in a large serving bowl, add the arugula and dressing, gently toss to combine everything. The arugula will begin to wilt a bit with the heat from the potatoes but will keep that nice crunch. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Serve.\n    \n\nchampagne, white wine or white balsamic vinegar also work here  \nrosemary, thyme or other fresh herbs are nice in this salad, too  \nLeave out garlic for low FODMAPs"

    "markdown": "# Potato Stacks with Garlic, Thyme, and Parmesan - Little Broken\n_Potato stacks are the perfect side dish for a dinner party or holiday meal. They’re made with cream, fresh thyme, garlic, nutmeg, parmesan cheese, and potatoes. The crispy potatoes have a soft, creamy center piled with flavor._\n\n[![potato stacks](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-6.jpg)](https://www.littlebroken.com/creamy-potato-stacks-with-garlic-thyme-and-parmesan/)\n\n**What are Potato Stacks?**\n---------------------------\n\nThis potato dish is the star of any dinner table or holiday meal as it’s similar to **[scalloped potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/ina-garten-scalloped-potatoes/)**. The edges of the potatoes become crispy from the metal muffin cups while the center is perfectly tender. Parmesan cheese is an excellent pairing with potatoes, and this dish is no exception. You can substitute your favorite type of melty cheese if you prefer.\n\nIf your oven is full of other holiday dishes, you can cook these crispy herb potato stacks in the air fryer or counter oven instead. Even though this side dish is made with humble potato, the flavor combinations in this recipe will have you making this dish again and again.\n\nLooking for an easier potato side dish? Try our **[Cheesy Baked Mashed Potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/cheesy-mashed-potatoes/)** or **[Scalloped Potatoes with Cheese](https://www.littlebroken.com/cheesy-scalloped-potatoes/)**.\n\n![muffin tin potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-8.jpg)\n\n**Ingredients**\n---------------\n\nYou can find these simple ingredients in your local grocery store.\n\n*   **Heavy cream:** Heavy cream gives the potatoes a creamy flavor and bakes without separating.\n\n*   **Thyme leaves:** For best flavor, use fresh thyme. \n\n*   **Garlic:** Make sure the garlic is fresh and smells strongly of garlic for the best results.\n\n*   **Nutmeg:** This is a wonderfully warm fall spice. \n\n*   **Russet potatoes:** Russet potatoes are ideal for making these potato stacks but you can also use another starchy potato instead. Some great options include Yukon gold potatoes or white, yellow, or purple potatoes. Don’t use small fingerlings or petite potatoes since they won’t hold up as well.\n\n*   **[Kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2uFhEm0)**: Salt is important for potatoes to balance the starch. \n\n*   **Black pepper:** Freshly cracked black pepper adds flavor and a bit of spice.   \n\n*   **Parmesan cheese:** This hard, strong cheese pairs wonderfully with potatoes.   \n\n![ingredients for potato stacks recipe](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Ingredients.jpg)\n\n**What’s the Best Way to Slice the Potatoes?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe beauty of these crispy potato stacks are the thin slices of potatoes that create these little mounds.\n\n**Mandoline Slicer:** The best way to get your potatoes the perfect consistent slices is to use a **[mandoline slicer](https://amzn.to/3RWaTBh)**. This very sharp tool is used to make thinly sliced potatoes, other vegetables, fruit, cheese, or meat.\n\nYou do this by sliding the ingredient along the edge of the horizontal blade on the lowest setting. Be sure to use caution, as you can easily cut your fingers if you’re not careful.\n\n**Chef’s Knife:** If you don’t have a mandoline slicer, you can use a **[chef’s knife](https://amzn.to/3ByyQZX)** instead. The safest way to do this is to cut a slice off the bottom of the potato to get it to sit flat on the surface. Keeping your fingers out of the way, make cuts as thin as possible with a sharp knife.\n\n![sliced potatoes in a bowl](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Step.jpg)\n\n**How to Make Potato Stacks**\n-----------------------------\n\nHere are some brief instructions on how to make these cheesy stacks. You can find the full recipe below.\n\n1.  Prepare a standard muffin tray with nonstick cooking spray.\n2.  Warm together cream, thyme, garlic, and nutmeg in a small saucepan.\n3.  Toss the potato slices with salt and pepper and layer them into stacks in the prepared muffin pan.\n4.  Spoon the cream over each potato stack and then sprinkle with parmesan cheese.\n5.  Bake until the potatoes are knife tender and golden brown on top.\n6.  Remove the muffin pan from the oven and let sit. Run a knife around the edges to loosen up the stacks and carefully remove them to a serving platter.\n\n![potatoes with cream in muffin pan](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-Step2.jpg)\n\n**Recipe Tips**\n---------------\n\nHere are a few tips and tricks to ensure you get the best crispy parmesan potato stacks every single time.\n\n*   **Garnish!** Top each potato stack with a sprig of fresh herbs for a beautiful presentation. \n*   **Get the right size potatoes.** Make sure you buy medium to small-size potatoes so they fit in a standard muffin pan.\n*   **No need to peel potatoes.** In a hurry? Feel free to leave the skin on the potatoes before slicing them. Just clean the outside and scrub away any dirt.\n*   **Heavy cream is the key.** Do not replace heavy cream with half and half or milk. It will not thicken during baking and you’ll end up with oily potatoes.\n\n**Variations**\n--------------\n\nYou can easily make this tasty side dish with your favorite ingredients. Here are some options you can try:\n\n*   Use other fresh herbs like rosemary or oregano. If you don’t have fresh herbs, you can use dried herbs instead.\n*   Melty cheese like gruyere cheese, Havarti, mozzarella cheese, comte, cheddar, asiago, or romano.  \n*   Use your favorite seasonings depending on what you’re serving the potatoes with. Try using ginger, cardamom, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, or cayenne pepper. \n\n![stacked potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-7.jpg)\n\n**Other Ways to Cook This Dish**\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you aren’t able to use your oven because it’s been taken over by the **[Thanksgiving turkey](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-turkey-breast/)**, you can also cook these potato stacks in an **[air fryer](https://amzn.to/3RHQTCW)** or countertop oven.\n\nSimply prepare the potatoes as you normally would in the muffin tin and then pop it in the air fryer at 350 degrees and cook until the potatoes are soft all the way through.\n\nGarnish potato stacks with more parmesan cheese after they come out of the oven for added richness and flavor!\n\n![recipe for potato stacks](https://www.littlebroken.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Creamy-Potato-Stacks-with-Garlic-Thyme-and-Parmesan-11.jpg)\n\n**Storing Tips**\n----------------\n\n**Refrigerate:** Store these potato stacks in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. \n\n**Reheat:** You can reheat them in 30-second increments in the microwave until they’re heated through.\n\n**Freeze:** To freeze them, make the stacks in the oven, allow them to cool completely, place them in a single layer in a container, and store in the freezer for up to three months. Potatoes might not have the same texture and taste when thawed.\n\n**FAQs**\n--------\n\n****Do I need to use heavy cream to make potato stacks?****\n\nYou can make these potato stacks dairy-free with olive oil or bacon fat instead. They will not be as creamy but will have deliciously crispy edges.\n\n****What else can I top potato stacks with?****\n\nBesides topping them with fresh herbs, you can top them with cooked bacon.\n\n****How can I tell when the potatoes are done cooking?****\n\nYour fork or sharp knife should slide right through the stack with no resistance when they’re done baking.\n\n**Video: How to Make Potato Stacks**\n------------------------------------\n\n**More Holiday Side Dishes**\n----------------------------\n\n*   **[Hasselback Potato Gratin](https://www.littlebroken.com/hasselback-potato-gratin/)**\n*   **[Lemon Asparagus Risotto](https://www.littlebroken.com/asparagus-and-lemon-risotto-7-tips-on-how-to-make-the-perfect-risotto/)**\n*   **[Red Skin Mashed Potatoes](https://www.littlebroken.com/red-skin-mashed-potatoes-recipe/)**\n*   **[Roasted Asparagus with Lemon](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-asparagus-with-lemon/)**\n\n[Print](https://www.littlebroken.com/creamy-potato-stacks-with-garlic-thyme-and-parmesan/print/10492/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Description\n\n_Creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside, these creamy potato stacks are simple to make, delicious to eat, and really can’t be beat.

Preheat the oven to 375F. Spray 12 cup standard muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.\n2.  In a small sauce pan, whisk together cream, thyme, garlic, and nutmeg. Bring to a slow simmer and remove from the heat. You want the cream just heated through. Discard the thyme.\n3.  Toss the potato slices with salt and pepper and layer them into stacks in the prepared muffin cups, filling each one to the top but not over the top.\n4.  Spoon cream over each potato stack, filling almost to the top. You will have a couple or so slices exposed. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.\n5.  Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the potatoes are knife tender and golden brown on top.\n6.  Remove the muffin pan from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edges to loosen up the stacks and carefully remove them to a serving platter. Serve immediately.\n\n* * *\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Potatoes:** Other starchy potatoes can be used instead, such as Yukon gold potatoes or white, yellow, or purple potatoes.\n*   **Cream:** For best results, do not replace heavy cream with half and half or another milk alternative. In my experience, half and half will separate during baking, and potatoes turn out oily. \n*   **Leftovers:** Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\n\n### Nutrition\n\n*   **Serving Size:** 1 potato stack\n*   **Calories:** 164\n*   **Sugar:** 1.8 g\n*   **Sodium:** 251.7 mg\n*   **Fat:** 11.5 g\n*   **Carbohydrates:** 13.1 g\n*   **Protein:** 3 g\n*   **Cholesterol:** 35.2 mg\n\n_Recipe originally published November 2015_\n\nYou May Also Like…\n------------------"

And they love it even more when they find out how easy it is to make!\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-2.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! Your guests will LOVE it! \")\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to Cincinnati for a blogging event with [Kroger](https://www.kroger.com/). We have been working with Kroger this year so it was fun to see the headquarters, meet with the Kroger team, and spend time with the other Kroger bloggers.\n\nKroger asked every blogger to prepare a recipe for a holiday meal. We all shopped, cooked, and ate together and it was so much fun. We used the new [ClickList](https://www.kroger.com/onlineshopping/signin?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kroger.com%2Fstorecatalog%2Fservlet%2FOnlineShoppingStoreSetup) program to do our grocery shopping. We ordered our groceries online and then picked them up at the Kroger store.\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-7.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! It only takes 15 minutes to make! \")\n\nFor the holiday meal, I made my favorite Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini. I knew it would be a hit with the group!\n\nSo let’s talk about how easy this recipe is. I told you easy and I mean EASY. The appetizer starts with a baguette, but I don’t even have to slice it because I always buy the perfectly sliced baguette at Kroger (Smith’s in Utah). Next, I spread apple butter on the bread slices. I don’t make the apple butter, I totally cheat and use Private Selection Apple Butter. It is perfectly spiced and tastes amazing.\n\n![Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brie-Apple-and-Honey-Crostini-5.jpg \"Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini Recipe on twopeasandtheirpod.com This easy appetizer is perfect for holiday parties! \")\n\nOn top of the apple butter, I place slices of creamy [Murray’s Cheese Brie](http://www.murrayscheese.com/). I place the crostini in the oven until the brie gets all melty and gooey. Remove from the oven and top with candied pecans and a drizzle of honey. At home, I use my homemade [candied pecans](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/candied-pecans/) because I always have them on hand, but at the event I used Private Selections candied pecans and they are really tasty! Kroger really does have everything!\n\nAt the event, I also tried Private Selection’s Vanilla and Nutmeg Infused Honey and oh my goodness! It was the perfect ending to my crostini. If you can’t find it, any honey will do, but that honey is amazing!\n\nThe Brie, Apple, and Honey was the perfect start to our holiday feast! Everyone loved it. And let me tell you, when a group of bloggers makes a holiday meal, you leave very full and very happy. I was amazed by all of the creative and delicious dishes. I wish we could make dinner together every night!\n\nThis easy Brie, Apple, and Honey Crostini is the perfect holiday appetizer. It takes about 15 minutes to make and your guests will be raving about it until the next holiday season. Add it to your holiday menu NOW!\n\nMake sure you also check out my [BAKED BRIE RECIPE](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/baked-brie/)!

I may earn a small commission for my endorsement, recommendation, testimonial, and/or link to any products or services from this website.\n\n_These Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls are a healthy and hearty way to enjoy your morning meal! They’re also Vegan, Gluten Free, Sugar Free and Grain Free._\n\n**Edit:** the photos for this recipe were updated on 10/2019.\n\nWhat do you eat when it’s too cold for a smoothie, pancakes sound too complicated, and you’ve had oats for breakfast for way too many days in a row?\n\nFluffy Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls, of course!\n\n![ingredients for sweet potato breakfast bowl on round white cutting board](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl.jpg)\n\nThese sweet little spuds have made their way onto our [lunch](https://frommybowl.com/sweet-potato-boats-tahini-dressing/) and [dinner](https://frommybowl.com/sweet-potato-peanut-stew/) plates, so why is it that we don’t enjoy them for breakfast as well? To be honest, I’m not quite sure. Which is why I’m here to change that 😉\n\nThese Sweet Potato Bowls are _kind_ of like a smoothie bowl…but warm! Think **fluffy, caramel-y whipped sweet potatoes** infused with cinnamon and some healthy plant based fats, then sprinkled with some glorious toppings like pomegranate and pumpkin seeds. Are you drooling yet?\n\n![hand pouring milk into large bowl of sweet potato piececs](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-2-200x300.jpg)![hand mixer whipping sweet potato breakfast bowls in large glass bowl](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-3-200x300.jpg)\n\nObviously you can top your bowls with whatever you would like, but I was trying to stick with the winter theme here. And I must say, the combination of pomegranate, pumpkin seeds, cacao nibs, coconut yogurt, and some **[Easy Vegan Granola](https://frommybowl.com/easy-vegan-granola-recipe/)** is very, _very_ refreshing.\n\n![sweet potato breakfast bowls next to smaller bowls of topping ideas](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-4.jpg)\n\nI would be remiss if I forgot to mention that these Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls kinda taste like a healthy **[Sweet Potato Casserole](https://frommybowl.com/healthy-sweet-potato-casserole/)**. And who the _heck_ wouldn’t want to eat that for breakfast?! Because we are roasting our Sweet Potatoes before we whip them into their fluffy final product, they’re already naturally sweet. I personally thought they were great on their own, and didn’t feel the need to add any extra sugar to them. So not only are they vegan, but they are also gluten free, grain free, and sugar free as well!\n\nTo be honest, I don’t know if there are any more “free” labels out there that you’d even want to hit. So I’m going to stop my rambling, and get onto the good stuff (literally).\n\n![two sweet potato breakfast bowls topped with coconut yogurt, pomegranate seeds, and granola](https://frommybowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sweet_Potato_Breakfast_Bowls_Vegan_GrainFree_FromMyBowl-8.jpg)\n\n### **A Few Final Thoughts:**\n\n*   There are many ways to cook a sweet potato, but I would **strongly recommend** that you roast them for this recipe. Steaming and microwaving your spuds does **not** make them as soft, sweet, or caramelized as the oven. You are ultimately your own boss in life, but you have officially been warned! (_Please just roast them. You’ll thank me later_.)\n*   These bowls can be enjoyed both warm and chilled, but I must say that I prefer them warm. If you heat them up in the microwave, the sweet potatoes won’t lose their moisture!\n*   Short on sweet potatoes? You can easily sub them for pumpkin or butternut squash puree instead! Just keep in mind that squash will be less sweet, so you may need to add in 1 to 2 tablespoons of sweetener. I would recommend maple syrup or coconut sugar.\n\nIf you’re looking for more vegan breakfast recipes, you’ll also love these **[Pumpkin Spice Latte Overnight Oats](https://frommybowl.com/pumpkin-spice-latte-overnight-oats/)** or these **[Salted Caramel Apple Breakfast Bars](https://frommybowl.com/salted-caramel-apple-breakfast-bars/)**!\n\nFinally, if you make this recipe and decide to share it on [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/frommybowl/) or [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/frommybowl/)**,** don’t forget to tag me [**@FromMyBowl**](https://www.instagram.com/frommybowl/) + #FromMyBowl!

Preheat your oven to 400F and line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Wash the sweet potatoes, but do not peel them. Piece the potatoes a few times with a knife, then place on the tray and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a “caramel” starts to ooze out of the pierced holes. (Note: If you have large sweet potatoes, I would recommend cutting them in half lengthwise and placing them cut side down on the baking tray to reduce cooking time).\n2.  Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven, and carefully scoop our their flesh into a large bowl. Add in the milk, flax, nut butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Use a hand mixer to “cream” the mixture together on for 60 to 90 seconds, starting with the lowest setting. Alternatively, you can place all ingredients into a food processor and blend until thick and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.\n3.  Divide into serving bowls, top as desired, and serve warm. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n\n### Notes\n\n*   **Substitutions****:** ground flax can be replaced with ground chia seeds, or omitted.\n*   **Time Hacks:**  roasted sweet potatoes are the _most_ sweet and tender, but you can also microwave them for a few minutes in a time crunch. If you already have sweet potato puree and would like to use it in this recipe, use 1 1/3 cups for this recipe (~330 g)\n\nHey there, I’m Caitlin!

As it cooks, use a wooden spoon to break apart any large pieces. \n*   Remove the sausage from the pan and set it aside, leaving the fat in the skillet.\n*   Add the onions and bell pepper to the same skillet and cook for 3-5 minutes until they’re soft.

A serving size is one-half of an acorn squash per person.\n*   When you’re roasting acorn squash, look for a little caramelization around the edges. This is an easy way to add extra flavor.\n*   In this sausage and apple stuffed acorn squash recipe, I use nitrate-free sausage, which is better for you.\n\n*   **To Store**: Once your leftover acorn squash has cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n*   **To Reheat**: Reheat in a microwave or in the oven at 350°F until heated through.\n\n*   **Tender chicken or pork**: This dish is a full meal on its own, but it also pairs wonderfully with my [grilled chicken thighs](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/grilled-chicken-thighs/) or easy [oven pork chops](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/easy-oven-pork-chop-recipe/).\n*   **A seasonal salad**: A fresh, fall-inspired salad, like my [shaved Brussels sprouts salad](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/shaved-brussels-sprouts-salad/) is the perfect side dish to serve with sausage stuffed acorn squash.\n*   **Roasted vegetables**: Savory roasted vegetables, such as [roasted cauliflower](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/spicy-roasted-cauliflower-recipe/) or [cabbage steaks](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/cabbage-steak-recipe/) provide a nice balance to the sweetness in this recipe.\n\n*   **Add grains:** To make this dish even more satisfying, add a whole grain to the filling, such as [wild rice](https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-wild-rice-recipe/) or [quinoa](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/how-to-make-fluffy-quinoa/).\n*   **Top with cheese:** A salty, melty cheese would be so yummy on top. Try a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese or crumbled goat cheese.\n*   **Switch up the squash:** Enjoy all the winter squash while it’s in season and make a variation of this recipe with your favorite squash variety such as delicata squash. See my [stuffed butternut squash with Italian sausage](https://www.primaverakitchen.com/italian-sausage-stuffed-butternut-squash/) recipe for inspiration!\n*   **Nut:** top this recipe with your favorite nut such as [pecans](https://amzn.to/47GYtFJ), [almonds](https://amzn.to/47D4GCH) or [walnut](https://amzn.to/416CC87).\n\n*   [Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/3Ro9Hta): The squash is roasted on a standard 9×13 baking sheet.\n*   [Skillet](https://amzn.to/3R4pZFX): A large skillet is needed to cook the filling.\n*   [Knife](https://amzn.to/47Zsj8j): This recipe requires some chopping, so you’ll need a nice sharp knife.\n\n****How do I prepare acorn squash?****\n\nFirst, you’ll want to start with a good acorn squash. Look for one that is dark green in color, heavy for its size, and has no blemishes. Then, using a sharp knife, you’ll cut the squash in half between one of the ridges. Because of its shape, acorn squash is easier to cut if you place it on a towel to hold it steady. Next, you’ll remove the stem and scoop out the pulp and seeds. Now, your squash is ready to roast and fill with your favorite ingredients!\n\n****Can I eat the skin of an acorn squash?****\n\nYes, you can! After roasting acorn squash, the skin becomes soft and tender enough to cut with a fork. However, if you’d rather not eat the skin, you can easily separate it from everything else and just enjoy the inside of the acorn squash.\n\n****Could I use another vegetable instead of acorn squash?****\n\nYou can create endless variations of this recipe using different vegetables. You’ll want to choose vegetables that are sturdy enough to hold the stuffing when they’re cooked, like bell peppers, eggplant, or potatoes. Other varieties of squash like butternut squash or zucchini also work great.\n\nMore Delicious Squash Recipes\n-----------------------------\n\nWant more seasonal recipes?

It’s perfect for holiday entertaining, or you can even turn this into an easy fix it and forget it type of dinner — just like we did tonight.\n\nMy grandmother always made the most amazing cocktail meatballs whenever my parents had their annual Christmas party. Everything was made from scratch, from the meatballs to the sauce, and these were some awesome meatballs. Honestly, all of the guests raved about them!\n\nSo, I’ve been trying to find my grandma’s recipe, without much luck. But in the meantime, I have an easy cocktail meatball recipe that tastes just as good and is made entirely in your slow cooker. Seriously.\n\nUpdate! Here’s the [homemade cocktail party meatball](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/homemade-cocktail-party-meatballs/) recipe!\n\nThis recipe is inspired by our favorite [**cranberry orange ham**](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/cranberry-orange-crock-pot-ham/), which we usually have for Christmas dinner. And, it only uses five ingredients. You can’t beat that!\n\nYou start off with some pre-cooked frozen meatballs — You can use your favorite recipe for **[homemade meatballs](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/homemade-meatballs/)**, or you can buy them from the store — just make sure that they’re fully cooked.\n\n[![crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-in-slow-cooker](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-in-slow-cooker-.jpg)](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-in-slow-cooker/)\n\nYou put them into a slow cooker — I used a small one, but if you’re  cooking for a crowd, you can easily double the recipe and make these in a larger Crock-Pot.\n\nThen, you add some orange marmalade and cranberry sauce, plus the remaining ingredients, stir, and cook on high for two hours. After that, you can let the meatballs simmer on low until you’re read to serve them.\n\nEasy peasy? Definitely!\n\n[![crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-with-sauce-in-slow-cooker-meatloafandmelodrama-com](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-with-sauce-in-slow-cooker-meatloafandmelodrama.com_.jpg)](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-with-sauce-in-slow-cooker-meatloafandmelodrama-com/)\n\nThe sauce is thick, tangy and slightly sweet, and the meatballs are super tender and juicy.\n\n[![crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-appetizer-recipe](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-appetizer-recipe.jpg)](https://www.meatloafandmelodrama.com/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs/crock-pot-cranberry-orange-meatballs-appetizer-recipe/)\n\nRecipe for Crock-Pot cranberry orange meatballs\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*   ▢ 20 frozen meatballs (can use homemade or your favorite brand)\n*   ▢ 1 can jellied cranberry sauce\n*   ▢ ½ cup orange marmalade\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [dried minced onions](https://amzn.to/2PcaD1K)\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil or non-stic cooking spray\n\n*   Add olive oil to slow cooker, or use non-stick cooking spray\n    \n*   Add meatballs, and top with remaining ingredients\n    \n*   Stir to coat meatballs, cover and cook on high for 2 hours.

Log in here.\n\nIt’s an easy recipe that cooks in **one pan**, but the moment you take a bite, you will want to hire yourself to be head chef in an Italian restaurant.\n\nI’ve become more confident in the kitchen over the years and feel like I more or less know what to expect when I approach a recipe.\n\nEvery now and then, however, a recipe will catch me off guard in a very _very_ good way.\n\nThis Italian sausage butternut squash gnocchi is one of those recipes.\n\nI mean, I didn’t think it was going to be _bad_ by any means.\n\nButternut squash (my fave fall veg), Italian sausage (all things good), and gnocchi (pure comfort food) are all involved.\n\nAdd some butter and a handful of Parmesan cheese, and you have a dinner dream team.\n\nI was not, however, expecting this simple sausage and vegetable gnocchi to blow me away like it did.\n\nI took a bite and had to pause to ask myself if I had really made it.\n\nI suppose we are all allowed to blow ourselves away in the kitchen every now and then, but my goal has always been for _other_ people to feel that way about a recipe.\n\nThis Italian sausage and butternut squash gnocchi made **me** feel that way about myself.\n\nIt was a cool sensation, and I can’t wait for you to try this recipe and experience it too!\n\n![One pan butternut squash gnocchi on a plate](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Italian-Sausage-Butternut-Squash-Gnocchi-1.jpg)\n\n5 Star Review\n-------------\n\n> “Your description is spot on, I tasted this after making it and was blown away! It is so easy, so unique and everyone in the house loved it. This dish is truly gourmet!”\n> \n> — Sarah —\n\nHow to Make Butternut Squash Gnocchi\n------------------------------------\n\nCulinary rock star feelings aside, this is a delicious meal that is so easy to make, it almost feels like cheating.\n\n*   The entire recipe cooks in one skillet, _including_ the gnocchi.\n*   Since it’s packed with both lean protein and veggies, it works as an all-in-one meal, no extra sides required (just like with this [Cauliflower Pasta](https://www.wellplated.com/cauliflower-pasta/) and [Sweet Potato Pasta](https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-potato-pasta/)).\n*   It tastes like fall comfort on a plate and had me convinced for a moment that I was back in Italy.\n\n* * *\n\n### **The Ingredients**\n\n*   **Gnocchi**. Delightful, pillowy-soft potato gnocchi is a true crowd-pleaser. It pairs perfectly with the Italian sausage and butternut squash. Want to try your hand at homemade gnocchi? Try my [Sweet Potato Gnocchi](https://www.wellplated.com/sweet-potato-gnocchi/).\n*   **Italian Turkey Sausage**. For a boost of protein and even more comforting flavor, this recipe also includes Italian sausage. I use chicken or turkey sausage 99% of the time. It’s leaner than pork sausage but still delivers on flavor. Pinky promise, you won’t notice the swap.\n\nTip!\n----\n\n*   **Butternut Squash**. Sweet, flavorful, and nutritious. Butternut squash is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\n*   **Spinach**. For an extra boost of nutrition. Spinach is rich in fiber and vitamins.\n*   **Butter**. Since this recipe obtains its soul-satisfying flavor from only a few ingredients, make sure you use a good-quality butter. It makes a world of difference!\n*   **Sage**. For quintessential fall flavor.\n*   **Nutmeg**. Adds an irressitable warmth and coziness to the dish. Plus, it tastes fantastic with the butternut squash!\n*   **Parmesan**. The perfect finishing touch!\n\n### The Directions\n\n1.  Brown the sausage and remove to a plate.\n2.  Sauté the squash and onion with the garlic, sage, and spices.\n3.  Add the chicken broth and gnocchi. Stir in the sausage and spinach. Top with Parmesan. DIG IN!\n\nDietary Note\n------------\n\n*   **To Make Vegan**. If you need this to be a vegan butternut squash gnocchi recipe, you can swap the butter for vegan butter, vegetable broth for the chicken broth, omit the Italian sausage, and use a vegan Parmesan substitute.\n*   **To Make Gluten Free**. For gluten-free butternut squash gnocchi, select a gluten-free gnocchi option. Note that you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\n![Potato pasta, ground meat, and veggies in a pot](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sausage-Butternut-Squash-Gnocchi-1.jpg)\n\nStorage Tips\n------------\n\n*   **To Store**. Refrigerate leftover gnocchi in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days. \n*   **To Reheat**. Rewarm gently in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of extra chicken broth or water to keep it from drying out.\n*   **To Freeze**. Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating. \n\nMeal Prep Tip\n-------------\n\nBrown the sausage up to 1 day in advance. Refrigerate it in an airtight storage container.\n\nWhat to Serve with Butternut Squash Gnocchi\n-------------------------------------------\n\n![Italian sausage butternut squash gnocchi in a Dutch oven](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Italian-Sausage-Gnocchi-with-Butternut-Squash-Spinach-1.jpg)\n\n*   **[Dutch Oven](https://amzn.to/2R0QluK)**. Perfect for making this recipe!\n*   **Cheese Grater**. You can use a [box grater](https://amzn.to/2h3xS0R) or a [microplane grater](https://amzn.to/2Ts5yVf).\n*   **[Sharp Chef’s Knife](https://amzn.to/2uTgxir)**. The ideal tool for cutting the butternut squash.\n\nI am so excited for you to try this butternut squash gnocchi recipe! If you do give it a go, please let me know how it turned out in the comments section below.\n\nHearing from you makes my day even more than a second helping of this gnocchi did (and you know how strongly I feel about it by now?).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n**What is Gnocchi?**\n\nGnocchi is a soft, pillowy, Italian-style dumpling that’s made from potatoes. It’s typically eaten like pasta with a sauce.\n\nFor this recipe, I recommend using premade, shelf-stable gnocchi, which you can find near the pasta in your grocery store.\n\n**Can I Use a Different Type of Italian Sausage?**\n\nI prefer to use Italian turkey or chicken sausage because they have less fat. However, you can certainly use Italian pork sausage if you prefer.\n\n**Can I Use Pre-Cut Butternut Squash Cubes?**\n\nYes, you can cut a butternut squash yourself or use pre-cut butternut squash cubes. Depending upon the size they are cut, you may need to adjust the saute time accordingly.\n\nemail me the recipe!\n--------------------\n\nEnter your email below to save this recipe to your free Well Plated recipe box.\n\nFrom time to time, we’ll send you the best of Well Plated.

Once the butter is melted, add the sausage. Cook, breaking apart the meat, until it is browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a plate.\n    \n*   Reduce the skillet heat to medium. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Once melted, add the squash and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender and golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic, salt, pepper, rubbed sage (if using fresh sage, wait to add it until the end), and nutmeg. Continue cooking until the garlic is softened and fragrant, about 1 additional minute.\n    \n*   Add 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and gnocchi to the skillet. Increase the heat to medium high. Stir to coat the gnocchi, then cover the pan. Cook, covered, until the gnocchi is just tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover and stir in the sausage. Stir in the spinach a few handfuls at a time, allowing it to wilt. If you’d like a looser sauce, add a bit more chicken broth. Sprinkle with Parmesan and season to taste with additional salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Enjoy hot.\n    \n\n*   **TO STORE**: Refrigerate gnocchi in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days. \n*   **TO REHEAT**: Rewarm gently in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of extra chicken broth or water to keep it from drying out.\n*   **TO FREEZE**: Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months.

This scrumptious Summer salad is fun, fruity, and flavorful, and topped with the most amazing homemade blueberry balsamic dressing._\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070.jpg)\n\nWhile I’m no stranger to [dumping blueberries into my salads](https://peasandcrayons.com/2016/08/blueberry-broccoli-spinach-salad.html), I’ve never once considered blending them into a dressing. Well not until a berry dressing finally knocked my socks off, that is. There’s a sweet raspberry dressing at a local lunch spot here that has totally changed my mind about fruity dressings and holy cow I’ve been missing out!\n\nSince I suspect their berry dressing is laced with enough sugar to classify it as liquid candy, I figured I had two choices: embrace dessert salads and give up donuts in favor of sugar-laden greens \\*OR\\* make my own healthy berry salad dressing at home.\n\nObviously I chose the latter.\n\n_No way am I giving up donuts!_\n\nRaspberries don’t last long in this house, as my [pint-sized sidekick](https://peasandcrayons.com/chickpea), can clear out a carton in a sitting, so I decided to tackle the bucket of farm-fresh blueberries we picked the week prior.\n\nI blended a cup of berries into my go-to [balsamic dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/2017/03/strawberry-steak-salad-with-homemade-balsamic-dressing.html) and had to talk myself down from polishing off the entire jar right then and there. I really am kicking myself for not jumping on the fruity dressing bandwagon when it first became a thing. It’s totally legit!\n\nBring on the berries!\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Salad topped with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/healthy-cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peas-and-crayons-2.jpg)\n\n:: vegetarian :: gluten-free :: dairy-free :: paleo :: clean eating ::\n\n![Cranberry Blueberry Spring Mix Salad with Blueberry Balsamic Dressing](https://peasandcrayons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cranberry-blueberry-spring-mix-salad-blueberry-balsamic-dressing-recipe-peasandcrayons-1070-200x200.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 1 heaping cup blueberries\n*   ▢ 1 4-5 oz bag spring mix salad greens\n*   ▢ ½ English cucumber, chopped\n*   ▢ ½ cup mandarin orange segments\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [dried cranberries](https://amzn.to/2xfMnEi)\n*   ▢ 2-4 TBSP roasted unsalted sunflower seeds\n\n#### BLUEBERRY BALSAMIC DRESSING:\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup blueberries\n*   ▢ ⅓ cup [balsamic vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qdt4WJ)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP [red wine vinegar](http://amzn.to/2qgx73B)\n*   ▢ 2 TBSP dijon mustard\n*   ▢ 1 TBSP  honey\n*   ▢ 1 tsp salt I use sea salt\n*   ▢ ⅛ tsp black pepper\n*   ▢ ½ cup [avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2fyn7A) olive oil works too\n\n*   First make your dressing: In a [food processor](http://amzn.to/2re4Boz) or [blender](http://amzn.to/2rdX09u), combine all dressing ingredients except for the avocado oil. Blend until blueberries are completely pureed, then use the little top cut-out to drizzle in the avocado oil at the end. Once dressing is emulsified you're good to go!\n    \n*   Wash + dry your greens. \n    \n*   Combine with cucumber and blueberries, then toss with a drizzle or two of dressing. Add extra as desired.\n    \n*   Top with mandarin orange segments, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds and serve!\n    \n\nMaking this salad in advance? Go for it! Mix together everything minus the orange and dressing then combine when ready to serve!\n\nNOTE: This recipe makes a bottle's worth of dressing which will keep great in the fridge for future salads. Only want a little? Feel free to halve the recipe!\n\nRecipe yields 2 large salads or 4 side salads.\n\n_Nutrition Facts below are estimated using an online recipe nutrition calculator.

Please read our disclosure policy.\n\nOne of the great ironies of writing a food blog and [a cookbook](https://amzn.to/2SAd7JF) is that the nights I _think_ I’ll enjoy cooking the most—the ones when I’m not following or testing a recipe and thus can toss in a pinch of this and a handful of that without even (GASP!) measuring—end up being the ones I most _wish_ I’d documented our meal with my usual rigor. Such was the case with this **Sweet Potato, Kale, and Chicken Skillet with Goat Cheese and Cranberries.**\n\n![An easy, healthy chicken dinner with sweet potatoes, kale, cranberries, and goat cheese. Ready in 30 minutes and filled with the best flavors of the season! Serve with wild rice, cauliflower rice, or enjoy it on its own for a fast and healthy chicken dinner!](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Easy-Healthy-Chicken-Skillet-Dinner-with-Sweet-Potatoes.jpg)\n\nEmail Me the Recipe!\n--------------------\n\nEnter your email below to save this recipe to your free Well Plated recipe box.\n\nFrom time to time, we'll send you the best of Well Plated.

Log in here.\n\nBen and I both loved this dish so much, my immediate reaction is to want to share it with you all here!\n\nThis easy chicken dinner is my favorite kind of meal and the way I cook most often: a one-pan dinner that offers both protein and veggies so I don’t need to cook a separate side.\n\nI also always make sure I add a few flavor boosters so that even though the ingredients are simple (ahem, whatever I could dig out of my fridge), the recipe tastes special, intentional, and like something that really could have come from a cookbook, instead of its actual source—my moderately sleep-deprived brain after a glass of Cabernet.\n\nWELL, perhaps I do some of my best work after a glass of red, because what started as a throw-it-all-in, see-what-happens stand-up dinner turned out to be a meal that we truly loved and that I was ecstatic to eat a second time.\n\n![Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet.

Originally I made the recipe with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, but since I only have that in my refrigerator once a year, I updated today’s version to use cooked, shredded chicken instead. If you need an easy way to make it, check out my [How to Cook Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/how-to-cook-shredded-chicken/) for my favorite easy, foolproof method. [Crock Pot Shredded Chicken](https://www.wellplated.com/crock-pot-shredded-chicken/) and [Baked Chicken Breast](https://www.wellplated.com/baked-chicken-breast/) are also great.\n\nIn an ideal world, I cook my shredded chicken in advance, but if you follow my method above, you can start the chicken cooking when you begin the recipe and it will be ready by the time you need to add it to the skillet with the veggies.\n\nFor an even greater shortcut, you can try this recipe with shredded store-bought rotisserie chicken.\n\n*   **Sweet Potatoes**. I almost always have one or two of these sweet orange beauties in my pantry. They are a quick and healthy add to almost any fall or winter dinner.\n*   **Kale**. Sturdy kale is ideal for stir-fry and skillet-type recipes like this because it can hold up to the heat and other bold flavors. The amount called for will seem like a lot at first, but it will cook down significantly.\n\n![Healthy Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet made with cranberries and goat cheese. Easy and healthy chicken dinner!](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Easy-Chicken-Recipe-with-Kale-Sweet-Potatoes-Goat-Cheese.jpg)\n\nNext, the flavor boosters! Don’t miss these. They make the recipe.\n\n*   **Goat Cheese**. Crumbled goat cheese melts into the nooks and crannies, makes the recipe creamy, and gives the dish just enough indulgence to make it taste satisfying. I like to stir in half, then leave the rest to crumble on top so that I get delightful little pockets of it with every forkful.\n*   **Balsamic Vinegar**. When I was first cooking this dish, I tasted it at the end and felt it lacked a little pop. A splash of balsamic vinegar did the trick! It brightens up the ingredients and balances the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes.\n*   **Fresh Herbs**. Use any mix of sage, rosemary, and thyme, all of which seem to make their way in and out of my refrigerator this time of year. I really recommend fresh over dried (dried doesn’t have the same wonderful effect). Look for the poultry herb mix, which usually offers all three.\n*   **Dried Cranberries or Pomegranate**. I love adding a handful of these little jewels anytime I’m doing a fall-themed recipe. The first time I used pomegranate seeds because we happened to have some leftover. The second I used dried cranberries, because we always have them around and I wanted to see how the dish would taste with more of a pantry staple. Answer: both are delicious! Feel free to choose your favorite.\n\nPomegranates feel fancier; dried cranberries are easier and still taste great.\n\n![Easy Chicken Sweet Potato Kale Skillet.

This dish is yummy on its own, but I loved it most with a [brown and wild rice mix blend like this one](https://amzn.to/2UoNZ8A).

    "markdown": "# Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet | Greens & Chocolate\n**Butternut Squash Chicken Sausage and Kale Quinoa Skillet** is a stunning autumn dinner with **simple ingredients but BIG flavors**! \n\n![](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Butternut-Squash-Quinoa-Skillet-14.jpg.webp)\n\nOne of my favorite things about food blogging is when I come up with a recipe idea in my head and get to see it come to life in the kitchen.  While I don't always take the time to sit back and think \"hey!  that's pretty cool that I made that!\" I definitely did with this recipe.\n\nThis Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet was one of those recipe ideas that I just wasn't quite sure it was going to work out.  It was either going to be 'pretty good' but not blog-worthy, or 'REALLY FREAKING GOOD.'  Lucky for all of us, it was the latter!\n\nThe thing about a dish like this is that the flavors are so simple and uncomplicated, but work together perfectly.  From the sweet butternut squash (which is also delicious in this [Crunchy Honey Butternut Squash Casserole](https://greensnchocolate.com/crunchy-honey-butternut-squash-casserole/)!) and dried cherries to the smoky chicken sausage and tangy goat cheese - every bite is pure heaven!  Of course I couldn't help myself and added some kale, too.  I just love the stuff and my garden is still producing it, so I figured why not.  If you prefer spinach, chard, or another type of green, feel free to substitute!\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Ingredients](#ingredients)\n*   [Variations](#variations)\n*   [Recipe Step by Step Instructions](#recipe-step-by-step-instructions)\n*   [Recipe FAQs](#recipe-faqs)\n*   [Other Comfort Food Recipes to Consider](#other-comfort-food-recipes-to-consider)\n*   [Butternut Squash, Chicken Sausage, and Kale Quinoa Skillet](#butternut-squash-chicken-sausage-and-kale-quinoa-skillet)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n![Ingredients in Butternut Squash Skillet including butternut squash, kale, quinoa, goat cheese, garlic, dried cherries, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, onion, and fresh sage. ](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Butternut-Squash-Quinoa-Skillet.jpg.webp)\n\n**Butternut Squash** \\- cubes of butternut squash are roasted and tossed into this quinoa dish.\n\n**Chicken Sausage** - I love using chicken sausage (Adell's is my favorite brand!) and in this dish I use apple chicken sausage.\n\n**Quinoa** - quinoa is a healthy grain that is a great source of fiber and protein. It's also the star in my [Mango Black Bean Quinoa Salad](https://greensnchocolate.com/mango-black-bean-quinoa-salad/).\n\n**Onion** - white or yellow onion both work in this recipe.\n\n**Garlic** - fresh garlic adds delicious flavor.\n\n**Fresh Sage** - I love adding fresh sage to fall dishes for an earthy flavor. I also love it in my [Garlic Herb Mayonnaise Roasted Turkey](https://greensnchocolate.com/garlic-herb-mayonnaise-roasted-turkey/) recipe!\n\n**Maple Syrup** - this is part of the very light sauce that adds some sweetness and warm flavor to the dish. It's not only used in sweet dishes like [Maple Muffins](https://greensnchocolate.com/maple-donut-muffins/)!\n\n**Dried Cherries** - cherries add a hint of sweetness and tartness. I love the texture they add, too.\n\n**Goat Cheese** - crumbles of creamy goat cheese make every bite a mouthful of flavor!\n\nSee recipe card for complete list of ingredients and quantities.\n\nVariations\n----------\n\nThis recipe is absolutely delicious as is, but here are some variations.\n\n**Different greens** - If you prefer spinach, chard, or another type of green, you can easily swap out the kale.\n\n**Different squash** - You could use diced acorn squash, diced delicata squash, or diced sweet potato instead of butternut squash.\n\n**Different grain** - if you aren't a fan of quinoa or have something else on hand, feel free to swap it. Other ideas include wheat berries, brown rice, couscous, barley, and farro.\n\n**Different cheese** \\- you could use Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, or blue cheese instead of goat cheese.\n\n**Swap the fruit.** Instead of dried cherries, you can use dried cranberries or pomegranate arils. I think diced apples would also be delicious!\n\nRecipe Step by Step Instructions\n--------------------------------\n\n![](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blank-1200-x-600-52.png.webp)\n\n1.

If you want to make it more of a salad, omit the chicken sausage.\n\n**Can this be made vegetarian?**\n\nDefinitely! You can either omit the chicken sausage altogether or use some sort of vegetarian sausage alternative.\n\n**What can I use instead of quinoa?**\n\nAny sort of grain would work in this recipe including couscous, barley, rice, wheatberries, etc.\n\n**How do I store leftovers?**\n\nStore leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days.\n\nIf you're looking for a delicious autumn dinner, folks - this is it!  I become completely obsessed with squash this time of year and this dish reminded me of why.\n\nOther Comfort Food Recipes to Consider\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   [\n    \n    Fajita Chicken Quinoa Bake\n    \n    ](https://greensnchocolate.com/fajita-chicken-quinoa-bake/)\n*   [\n    \n    Italian Chicken Sausage Quinoa Skillet\n    \n    ](https://greensnchocolate.com/italian-chicken-sausage-quinoa-skillet/)\n*   [\n    \n    Instant Pot Quinoa Minestrone\n    \n    ](https://greensnchocolate.com/instant-pot-quinoa-minestrone/)\n*   [\n    \n    Southwestern Salmon Quinoa Bowls\n    \n    ](https://greensnchocolate.com/southwestern-salmon-quinoa-bowls/)\n\nIf you make this recipe, **please let me know!** Leave a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating on this recipe below and leave a comment, or take a photo and [tag me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/greensnchocolate) with #greensnchocolate.\n\n![Butternut Squash Chicken Sausage Kale Quinoa Skillet](https://greensnchocolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Butternut-Squash-Chicken-Sausage-and-Kale-Quinoa-Skillet-1-320x320.jpg)\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup uncooked quinoa\n*   ▢ 1 medium butternut squash peeled and diced into bite-sized pieces\n*   ▢ 3 tablespoons olive oil\n*   ▢ ½ yellow onion diced\n*   ▢ 12 ounces chicken sausage links I used apple chicken sausage, cut into bite-sized pieces\n*   ▢ 4 cups chopped Tuscan kale about 6 stems\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon minced garlic about 2 cloves\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon fresh sage finely chopped\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon olive oil\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon maple syrup\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar\n*   ▢ ½ cup dried cherries\n*   ▢ 4 ounces crumbled goat cheese\n*   ▢ additional chopped sage for topping\n\n*   Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.\n    \n*   Place butternut squash on baking sheet (I lined mine with aluminum foil for easier clean up) and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.

A satisfying, veggie-filled and tasty breakfast.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-7-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### You may be wondering, what is a hash anyway?\n\nA hash is a dish of diced, ground or chopped meat and often times vegetables sautéed in a frying pan. We think it’s the perfect way to start the day when you’re in search of something savory, warm, satisfying, and hearty. Thanks to the well-balanced nature of this dish, it will keep your blood sugars stable all morning long, leaving you satisfied and ready to tackle the day.\n\nMaking a hash is also the perfect opportunity to ‘clean out the fridge’ and use up what you have on hand.

While this Butternut Squash and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a satisfyingly scrumptious egg-free breakfast, a fried egg or two makes a nice addition for extra protein and staying power. Whatever you choose, we know you’re going to love this recipe! \n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-5-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Meal prep-friendly.\n\n[**Butternut Squash**](https://therealfooddietitians.com/butternut-squash-noodles-with-sausage-and-kale/) and Apple Hash with Sausage makes for a great recipe for your weekend meal prep.

You know exactly what goes into the sausage when you make your own. The sausage is freezer-friendly so if you wish, you could double or triple the sausage portion of the recipe so that you can stock your freezer with some for future meals and recipes.\n\n![](https://therealfooddietitians.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Butternut-Squash-and-Apple-Hash-with-Sausage-8-683x1024.jpg)\n\n#### Not a kale lover?

Filled with ingredients that are not only good for you but also taste great and fill you up._ \n\n![sweet potato, avocado and feta salad in a white bowl on a wooden cutting board](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad1-1.jpg)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you ever been at a restaurant and ordered what they deemed to be a \"salad\" but turned out to be a few pieces of limp lettuce, tomato and if you were lucky ONE slice of cucumber?  Yeh - I'm not about that.\n\nLife is too short for boring salads!  And if there's one thing that has made me thoroughly enjoy eating salads over the years it's combining my favourite foods in a bowl and calling it a salad.\n\nLike this **Roasted Sweet Potato and Feta Salad**.  It's a salad I can really get behind.\n\nFilled with ingredients that are not only good for you but also taste great and fill you up.  Trust me - you won't be starving in an hour after eating a bowl of this.\n\nThere are so many delicious elements to this salad.  Some highlights for me are:\n\n*   The Light and Zesty **Honey Lemon Vinaigrette.**\n*   The Crumbled Salty and Tangy **Feta Cheese.**\n*   The Caramelised and Crispy **Red Onion Wedges.**\n*   The Crunchy **Almond Bits.**\n*   The Combination of **Sweet Potato** and **Avocado.**  These two are made for each other.\n\nYep - you **need** this salad in your life.\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [](#)\n*   [🥘 INGREDIENTS](#%f0%9f%a5%98-ingredients)\n*   [💭 CAN I MAKE THIS SALAD AHEAD?](#%f0%9f%92%ad-can-i-make-this-salad-ahead)\n*   [🥗 MORE SCRUMPTIOUS SALAD RECIPES:](#%f0%9f%a5%97-more-scrumptious-salad-recipes)\n*   [📋 RECIPE](#%f0%9f%93%8b-recipe)\n*   [💬 COMMENTS AND REVIEWS](#comments)\n\n![sweet potato, avocado and feta salad ingredients arranged on a marble background](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad.jpg)\n\n🥘 INGREDIENTS\n--------------\n\n*   **Sweet Potato**\n*   **Olive Oil**\n*   **Avocado**\n*   **Feta Cheese**\n*   **Red Onion**\n*   **Almonds**\n*   **Spinach**\n*   **Honey**\n*   **Lemon**\n*   **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**\n\n### SUBSTITUTION SUGGESTIONS AND NOTES\n\n**Greens:**  I've used spinach in this recipe, but I've also made it with a mixed lettuce leaf blend and it tasted great too.  Feel free to make it with your favourite green.\n\n**Oil:**  I use two different types of oil in this recipe - Olive Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).  I generally use Olive Oil for roasting and EVOO for dressings.  EVOO has a lower smoke point and I find it generally has a nicer and lighter taste, which is why I save it for dressings.\n\n**Nuts:**  I almost always have almonds in my cupboard, and find they are the perfect versatile crunch in salads.  Having said that, so many nuts would work well in this recipe.  If you don't have almonds on hand (or just don't like them), try pine nuts, walnuts or pecans instead.\n\n**Dressing:**  I've made a simple honey lemon vinaigrette for the dressing.  If honey isn't your thing, you can substitute for maple syrup or brown rice / rice malt syrup OR simply omit altogether if you don't want a sweetener.\n\n![chopped sweet potato and onion on a baking tray](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad2.jpg)\n\n💭 CAN I MAKE THIS SALAD AHEAD?\n-------------------------------\n\nRoasted vegetable salads do take a little longer to prepare than those made with more traditional salad ingredients, but there are a few ways to plan ahead to cut down prep time on the day and make this an easy work lunch.\n\nYou can roast a few sweet potatoes at the start of the week and use these to make up the salad each day as you go.  This is a great option if you want to have this salad as a quick weeknight dinner.  It'll be on the table in 5 minutes.  Roasted sweet potato will last in the fridge in an airtight container for 5 days.\n\nOR you can prep the salad minus the dressing, nuts and avocado and portion out for a day or two.  Then when the time comes simply add in some chopped avocado and dressing.  I don't recommend prepping salads too far in advance, as I find the ingredients don't tend to hold up that well.  But prepping this for a work lunch the night before is absolutely fine.\n\n![sweet potato, avocado and feta salad in a white bowl](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sweetpotsalad4.jpg)\n\n🥗 MORE SCRUMPTIOUS SALAD RECIPES:\n----------------------------------\n\n*   [Roast Pumpkin, Spinach and Feta Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/pumpkin-feta-salad/)\n*   [Middle Eastern Bean Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/bean-salad/)\n*   [Cabbage and Crunchy Noodle Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/cabbage-and-crunchy-noodle-salad/)\n*   [Crunchy Kale Salad with Lemon Tamari Dressing](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/crunchy-kale-salad-lemon-tamari-dressing/)\n*   [Roast Pumpkin and Chickpea Salad](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/roast-pumpkin-chickpea-salad/)\n*   [35 Easy and Yummy Salad Recipes](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/yummy-salad-recipes/)\n*   OR see all [Salad Recipes](https://www.cookitrealgood.com/category/recipes/salads/)\n\nIf you’ve tried this **Roasted Sweet Potato, Avocado and Feta Salad** I’d love to hear how you enjoyed it!

    "markdown": "# Chipotle Chicken Skewers\nA gourmet dish that's fit for the grill!\n\n![These cipotle honey chicken skewers are a wonderful way to enjoy a delicious and nutritious dinner!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-1-1200x799.jpg)\n\nDoes this sound familiar? You’ve just invited friends and family to a cookout at your place next weekend, but now you’ve found yourself at a bit of a loss for what to feed them! Hamburgers and hotdogs? Been there, done that. The routine BBQ Chicken that always seems to get scorched on the outside while it’s undercooked on the inside. Umm…maybe not.\n\nHow about adding a surprising gourmet touch that will make you famous for your skills at the grill, but it’s so simple you won’t even break a sweat? Sound good? If so, our Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers are the perfect option!\n\nThese skewers are everything you’re looking for in a backyard-friendly grilling dish. Our recipe offers a blend of enticing flavors, clean eating ingredients, and an unexpected taste that will have your guests asking, “What’s in this?” Well, the answer is healthy flavor– and _a lot of it._ \n\n**What Ingredients Do I Need?**\n-------------------------------\n\n![These flavorful chipotle honey chicken skewers will be the star of your cookout!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-6-e1629296144774.jpg)\n\nFirst, you’ll need some chicken! We suggest using boneless, skinless chicken breasts for their low fat and high protein content. Then, whisk together some honey for natural sweetness, tomato paste and apple cider vinegar for a tangy bite, chipotle chili powder for some heat, and garlic for a rich, savory finish. Each ingredient is healthy, and when combined in a sauce, the flavors complement one another perfectly. Oh, and did we mention it’s EASY?\n\n**Making These Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![Grill up some chicken skewers instead of plain old hamburgers and hotdogs. ](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Chipotle-Honey-Chicken-Skewers-Dinner-Recipe-5-e1629296192708.jpg)\n\nThe preparation process for these honey chipotle chicken skewers is incredibly simple. So simple, in fact, that they can be on the table in less than 30 minutes! Start by slicing your chicken breasts into very thin strips using your sharpest knife. Once all of the slices are ready, begin threading them, accordion-style, onto the wooden skewers that you’ve soaked in some water beforehand (so they don’t burn through). This recipe is for eight skewers, so you should aim to get about four ounces of uncooked chicken onto each one.\n\n[![](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Skinny-Ms-Graphics-Horizontal-728-x-450-px-2.png)](https://bundles.skinnyms.com/?utm_source=skinnyms&utm_medium=inpostbanner)\n\nSet your skewered chicken to the side while you make the chipotle honey sauce. Grab a small bowl and whisk together the honey, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, chipotle chili powder, chopped garlic, and optional salt. Spoon the sauce evenly over the skewers. Alternatively, you can make the sauce in advance and marinate your sliced chicken in it for 30 minutes or longer before threading the strips on your skewers. Either way, make sure to save some of the sauce for basting during the grilling process.\n\nYour uncooked chicken skewers can rest in the fridge (covered with plastic or foil) while you’re preparing your side dishes. That way, you can throw them on the grill right before dinner time so they’re fresh and hot off the grill! When you’re ready, add the skewers to a hot grill for 10 to 12 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. Throughout the grilling process, baste the chicken with sauce, turning the skewers every 2 to 3 minutes. This will ensure the chicken is evenly cooked.\n\nIf the rain clouds come out and you’re forced to move inside, away from the grill, you’ll be glad to know that this recipe can also be prepared in the oven. Preheat it to 400 degrees. Cook them for 16-18 minutes or until fully cooked, rotating and basting every 5 or 6 minutes. If you like a little crisp on your sauced chicken, turn the broiler on and broil them for a minute or two once they are cooked, but be careful not to burn!\n\n**What Side Dishes Go With These Chicken Skewers?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Our quick and easy southwest cucumber avocado salad is a must-make this Summer!](https://skinnyms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Quick-and-Easy-Southwest-Cucumber-Avocado-Salad-8-e1606794206790.jpg)](https://skinnyms.com/quick-and-easy-southwest-cucumber-avocado-salad/)\n\nOur honey chipotle chicken skewers will no doubt be the star of the dinner plate, but every star needs a supporting actor (or two!).

The opinions and text are all mine._\n\nDoes the cold weather make you just crave comfort food?  I know it does that to me.  And although I have plenty of room on my meal plan for [warm soups](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/), [cheesy pasta](https://www.foxandbriar.com/one-pot-pasta-bake-sausage-wine/) and all other kinds of comfort food, sometimes I want to keep it healthier and focus on fruits and veggies.  As I shared before with my [Roasted Shrimp, Fennel and Grapefruit Kale Salad](https://www.foxandbriar.com/roasted-shrimp-fennel-and-grapefruit-kale-salad/), I like my cool weather salads to be bulked up with roasted veggies and grains.  Here I have kept the farro and kale, but added roasted delicata squash and pomegranate aerials for that sweet tart zing.  Once again, my local Fred Meyer came through for me by having all the ingredients I needed for this salad, including these gorgeous pomegranates.\n\n[Jump to recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/autumn-harvest-salad-with-pomegranates/#recipe)\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

This is the most popular method online. Use a knife to score the skin of the pomegranate all the way around the middle, but don’t cut into the seeds.  Use your hands to gently pry the two halves apart.  Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a large bowl.  Be sure your hand is under the pomegranate.  Use a large spatula or spoon to smack the top of the pomegranate.  This is supposed to make all the seeds fall out easily.  This seems to work for many people, but it didn’t work very well for me.  Keep reading to see my prefered method.\n    2.  Score the skin of the pomegranate into quarters.  Carefully pry the quarters apart.  Use your thumb and fingers to remove the seeds (arils) from the white pith.  This is not my favorite method because it is very messy.  Often the juice will get all over everything and it can stain.\n    3.  Start the same way as option 2, by scoring the pomegranate skin into quarters.  However, for this method you will want a large bowl of cold water.  I like to use my salad spinner so that I can just lift the basket out of the water when I am done, retrieving all the seeds.  Under the water, pry apart the quarters, then use your thumb and fingers to gently separate the seeds from the white pith.  The seeds will sink to the bottom and most of the pith will float on top.  Remove the white pith from the water and drain the water, leaving you with only the arils.  This is my favorite method and I have found it works best for me.  Feel free to try different options to see which one you prefer!\n\n![This Autumn Harvest Salad uses the beautiful produce available as the months start to get colder, such as delicata squash, kale, and pomegranates, as well as farro and goat cheese to make a hearty cold weather salad.

And if you’re reading this post, they’re probably some of yours too, which means we can totally be friends. A friend who shares her bacon is a friend for life. BFFs = Bacon. Friends. _Forevah_.\n\nBrussels sprouts are sort of a culinary line in the sand, right? If you love them, you really _really_ love ’em. You love crispy [Brussels sprouts in the air fryer](https://oursaltykitchen.com/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts/) and [shredded Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/shredded-brussels-sprouts/) in the oven. You love them raw in a salad, and you definitely wouldn’t turn your nose up at [Christmas Brussels sprouts](https://oursaltykitchen.com/pan-roasted-brussels-sprouts-cranberries-pistachios/) with pistachios and cranberries.\n\nAnd if you don’t? Well, **you just might need bacon and bourbon to make ’em palatable**. And you’re in luck!\n\nMaple bacon Brussels sprouts are both sweet and savory; crunchy and tender; and oh so very pretty to look at. The best part? This recipe is really easy to make – even for beginners!\n\n![The ingredients for maple bacon Brussels sprouts arranged on a marble table - brussels sprouts, diced bacon, chopped pecans, bourbon, mustard powder, and maple syrup.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-4.jpeg)\n\nIngredients\n-----------\n\n*   **Brussels Sprouts:** choose the freshest sprouts you can find. In their peak season, you can often find Brussels sprouts still attached to the stalk. Those are great! But they’re not essential. For the freshest Brussels sprouts, look for bright green sprouts with firmly packed leaves that aren’t yellow or withering. Avoid sprouts that are cracked or have too many black spots.\n*   **Bacon:** both regular and thick cut bacon work.\n*   **Pecans:** use raw, unsalted pecans. Coarsely chop them, or buy “pecan pieces”. If you don’t like pecans, walnuts are a nice substitute.\n*   **Ground (Dry) Mustard:** dry mustard is just ground up mustard seeds. On its own, it’s essentially flavorless, but once it’s “activated” by a liquid (in this recipe, bourbon) it bring a pleasant pungency and a bit of acidity to the dish.\n*   **Bourbon:** bourbon is used to deglaze the pan, and lends a smoky flavor. But more importantly, bourbon is slightly acidic! This is important, as the acidity will neutralize the sulfuric odors released during the cooking process (those orders, and resulting flavor, are why some find Brussels sprouts so off-putting. Neutralize it for clean, rich flavor!).\n*   **Maple Syrup:** our sweet foil! Opposites attract, and here we have a few. Maple syrup will balance out the saltiness in the bacon, the pungency of the mustard, and the acidity of the bourbon. It’s a must, so don’t skip!\n\n**BOURBON SUBSTITUTION:** If you don’t consume alcohol, or don’t want to use bourbon, replace it with two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.\n\nHow to Cut Brussels Sprouts\n---------------------------\n\nBefore you even get started, be sure to use sprouts that are (roughly) the same size – this way they’ll cook evenly, at the same rate! The only thing worse than a mushy sprout is an undercooked sprout, and uniformity from the start will make the job that much easier. \n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the ends trimmed.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-1.jpg)\n\n![Side view, Brussels sprouts on a cutting board with the outer leaves peeled off.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n![Side view, trimmed and peeled Brussels sprouts sliced in half on a cutting board.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/how-to-cut-brussels-sprouts-3.jpg)\n\n1.  Use sharp paring knife to **trim off the root end** of each sprout.\n2.  **Peel away any withered or yellowed leaves.** If your Brussels sprouts are very fresh you should only need to remove the outer layer.\n3.  **Slice each sprout in half lengthwise**, from top to bottom. This cut allows the densely packed leaves to cook through all the way to the center.\n\nHow to Make Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts\n----------------------------------------\n\nWith maple syrup, bacon, and pecans, this Brussels sprouts recipe has a little something for everyone. Start by blanching the Brussels sprouts in salted water, then finish them on the stove – this method creates tender interiors and crisp edges. The bourbon is optional, but recommended. You can substitute for apple cider vinegar if you don’t cook with alcohol.\n\n![Side view, bacon Brussels sprouts tossed with maple syrup and pecans in a white bowl with a wood spoon.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-2.jpg)\n\n1.  **Blanch the Brussels sprouts** in salted water. Cook 4-5 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender but still bright green. They’re ready once you can easily piece the stem using the tip of a knife.\n2.  **Strain the sprouts**, then run them under **cool running water or plunge into an ice bath** to stop the cooking process. Shake well, **then air dry** on a kitchen towel to remove any clinging water droplets.\n3.  **Cook the bacon in a 12″ skillet** over medium heat until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, then **remove the bacon pieces** using a slotted spoon.\n4.  Increase the heat to medium high and **add the Brussels sprouts and pecans** to the rendered bacon fat; **saute** until the edges of the sprouts are crisp, about 5 minutes.\n5.  **Sprinkle the ground mustard** over the sprouts and pecans and cook 1-2 minutes more.\n6.  **Deglaze the pan with the bourbon**, stirring constantly until its completely absorbed.\n7.  **Pour in the maple syrup** and cook 1 minute more, or until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve right away. Enjoy!\n\nChef’s Tips\n-----------\n\n*   Use **real maple syrup**, not pancake syrup, for pure maple flavor.\n*   **Swap pecans for walnuts**, or simply omit them.\n*   **Don’t overcook the Brussels sprouts when blanching!** Drain them when they’re still bright green, after 4-5 minutes.\n*   Season the water with **plenty of kosher salt** – about a tablespoon; it will infuse the Brussels sprouts with flavor from the inside out.\n*   Use a **large, 12″ skillet.** This allows the Brussels sprouts to make lots of contact with the surface for crispier edges.\n*   **Wait to season with salt and pepper** until the end – you may need just a pinch of salt, or none at all.\n\nWhat’s the Easiest Way to Cut Bacon?\n------------------------------------\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to slice bacon with a chef’s knife, it’s sort of a cumbersome process. Use kitchen shears instead! It makes for quick, efficient work.\n\nCan I Make This Recipe in Advance?\n----------------------------------\n\nYes, maple bacon Brussels sprouts are partially make ahead friendly!\n\nBlanch the Brussels sprouts, then plunge them into an ice bath. Drain, then store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Cook in the skillet as directed 15-20 minutes before you’re ready to serve.\n\n![A bowl of maple bacon Brussels sprouts on a marble table with a wood spoon and cream linen napkin to the side.](https://oursaltykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-3.jpeg)\n\n**Did you make these Maple Bacon Brussels Sprouts?

Bring the water to a boil and season with the kosher salt. Add the brussels sprouts to the boil water and give them a good stir. Boil 4-5 minutes, until the sprouts are tender but still bright green in color. Drain in a colander, run under cold water to stop the cooking process, then lay on a kitchen towel to dry.\n    \n*   Place the bacon in a 12\" skillet and heat over medium heat. Saute, stirring occassionally, until the fat renders and bacon is crisp, 7-8 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and place onto a paper-towel lined plate to drain.\n    \n*   Increase the heat to medium high, then add the blanched Brussels sprouts and pecans to the rendered bacon fat. Saute over high heat, stirring frequently, until the sprouts are crisp, 4-5 minutes.\n    \n*   Sprinkle the mustard powder over the sprouts and pecans, then stir constantly for 1 minute. Pour the bourbon (or cider vinegar) into the pan to deglaze; stir and scrape constantly until any browned bits have been scraped up and the bourbon is completely absorbed, 2-3 minutes.\n    \n*   Add the bacon back to the pan, then pour in the maple syrup. Give everything a good toss, then cook 1 minute more, until the syrup is slightly thickened. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper if needed. Serve right away, and enjoy!\n    \n\n**Make Ahead Instructions**\n\nAfter you’ve blanched the Brussels sprouts, drain them well, then spread onto a paper towel or kitchen towel to thoroughly dry. Place them into a sealed container or ziplock bag and place into the fridge, where they’ll keep for about 24 hours. When you’re ready to serve, start with Step 2.

Same delicious recipe!_\n\nI don’t think I could ever tire of strawberries. And with strawberry season here and gone so quickly, we must take advantage!\n\nHere in the Midwest, summertime is a constant reminder to truly take things in. To enjoy the days as they are. To accept both the hot (often humid here) weather and the thunderstorms. To take advantage of the long days and spend more time with one another. To get outside and enjoy nature and the blue skies before it gets cold and gray again.\n\nEven though the days are longer, these months do not last long, and I’m finding that summer teaches us to be more present. To appreciate what we have when we have it. It is all about perspective. And finding joy in the little things.\n\nThe Perfect Strawberry Salad\n----------------------------\n\nThis spinach strawberry salad recipe is going to be on repeat all season!\n\nIt’s the perfect **light and refreshing lunch or dinner salad** – just add your favorite protein like chicken breasts, [salmon](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/sweet-spicy-glazed-salmon-paleo/), tempeh, [roasted chickpeas](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/chickpea-shawarma-bowls/), etc.\n\nThe **coconut honey lime dressing adds unique flavor** and is so delicious – I could drink it!\n\nThis simple salad can be **easily customizable and adapted to your liking.** Or your guests liking, depending on who you’re enjoying it with.\n\nThis is the **perfect salad recipe for picky eaters** – who doesn’t love strawberries and sweet creamy poppy seed dressing?\n\n[![hands using silver salad tongs in bowl of spinach with strawberries](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-14.jpg)](https://www.fitmittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Strawberry-Spinach-Salad-14.jpg)\n\nSalad Ingredients\n-----------------\n\n*   **spinach –** I prefer spinach for this strawberry salad but you could always do a mix of greens or use what you have on hand.\n*   **strawberries** – fresh, juicy ones!

Here, I’ve included the method used by restaurants to get that ideal, slightly dried-out rice without having to wait a day. The YouTube channel [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChineseCookingDemystified/) is one of my favorite places to go for all my Chinese culinary questions. The method that its hosts Steph and Chris use to par-boil then steam the rice is borderline miraculous in the results you get. The Delish kitchen team was floored at the consistent texture you get with the rice, and I for one will not be cooking my rice any other way going forward.  \n• **Oil:** Choose an oil with a high-smoke point, and don’t be afraid to use a lot of oil—this is fried rice after all.  \n• **Eggs**: I use 3 large eggs in this recipe. I prefer to have some white streaks in my eggs, so I barely beat them together.  \n• **Garlic:** I like my fried rice super garlicky, so I use 5 cloves. You can take it back if you want, but honestly, I don’t suggest it—the more garlic, the better.  \n• **Ginger:** About an inch of ginger, minced very small, goes with the garlic before adding in our veggies.  \n• **Scallions:** When chopping your scallions, separate the whites and the greens. The green we’ll use as a garnish, and the white we’ll cook with.  \n• **Soy Sauce:** The first thing you’ll notice about this recipe is that soy sauce is included. While to some, this might not be super-traditional in fried rice, a lot of American eaters (and Delish taste testers) prefer it! Because there is no meat or seafood in this fried rice, after some testing, I felt it added some extra body and umami to the rice that is totally delicious. I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce so you can control the salt amount.  \n• **Sugar:** I believe that all savory dishes should be finished off with a bit of sugar if there isn’t a natural source of sweetness in it. It helps to round out the dish and provide a more complex flavor.  \n• **White Pepper:** White pepper is underutilized outside of fancier kitchens, but it’s worth buying if you can. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite things about this recipe; at home, I’ll add even more. It’s earthy, and has less of a kick than black pepper.  \n• **MSG:** MSG adds the perfect sweet-salty boost to fried rice. It’s a widely misunderstood ingredient—checkout this article all about [MSG](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35119070/msg-monosodium-glutamate/) if you’re looking to learn more.  \n• **Peas:** I personally love peas in fried rice, and find it’s a common addition in many American versions. Don’t worry about using frozen peas, they won’t emit too much moisture to the rice.  \n• **Butter:** Using butter is a bit controversial, but it adds a wonderful richness, and a little bit goes a long way. If you really don’t want to use it, you can omit it.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nLeftover rice works perfectly for fried rice, so if you have some hanging out in your fridge, use it here. But, if you don’t have any, never fear: I’ve found a 2-step technique to make freshly cooked rice absolutely perfect for fried rice. The first step of making any rice dish is to adequately clean your rice. Some people like to do this in the pot they’re going to cook their rice in, but I like to use a mesh strainer. Rinse the rice—moving around the grains frequently—until the water comes out clean.\n\nOnce your rice is ready, you’re going to par-boil the rice for just a few minutes. This will help to jumpstart the cooking process, breaking down the outsides of the grains of rice.\n\nOnce you strain the rice, we’re ready to make an impromptu steamer with a pot and a strainer that fits inside of it. First, add some water to the bottom of the pot, then put the strainer filled with your rinsed rice in it. Next, you’re going to want to create some holes in the rice with chopsticks to allow steam to circulate.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9983579638752053xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-1-6631546a44cf9.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter making your holes, cover the pot with tin foil; it doesn’t have to be totally snug, but it should be well-tented. Then, cover with the pot lid and let it steam. Steaming the rice is a gentler cooking process that keeps the grains pretty dry and adds less moisture to the rice, which is what we’re looking for.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-2-6631546aa8bd1.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, check on your rice: It should almost taste al-dente. What I mean by this is that it should be fully cooked through, but should taste drier than normal steamed rice. Once it’s ready, I like to spread my rice on a sheet pan. This is a bit of overkill, but it will help your rice to cool down more quickly (which means fried rice faster!).\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-3-6631546a9efc4.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNow that our rice is ready, let’s focus on bringing everything together. A wok is the most traditional way to cook fried rice, and it does work especially well. The movement and centralized heat are very helpful, and its size holds a large amount of rice . But if you don’t have one, don’t let that stop you: I’ve made incredible fried rice in a cast iron skillet.\n\nBarely beat the eggs together (if you prefer some whites in your egg) before adding to your wok. Once you add to the wok, move your eggs around quickly, pressing in with a spatula to make those perfect fried rice egg squiggles. Once they’re ready, take them out, and give your wok a quick wipe down. I recommend pre-cooking your eggs because if they sit in the fried rice for awhile, they will get overcooked.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-4-6631546a6c8bd.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nNext, it’s time to add your oil. Don’t be shy here: This is fried rice after all, so add enough to coat all of the grains in the oil. Add in your ginger and garlic: This will help flavor the oil which will transfer to your entire dish. Then, add the green onions and cook until softened, flipping and stirring frequently to prevent any burning.\n\nAdd all of your rice, tossing and stirring it constantly (I mean it!). You should see the grains start to become individual, which is the tell-tale sign of a well-done fried rice. Once you see that the rice is separating, it’s time to add your seasonings and soy sauce.\n\n![fried rice](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=980:* \"Fried Rice\")[![pinterest](https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff)](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25325036/how-to-make-fried-rice/&description=Delish&media=https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fried-rice-stills-5-6631546a53bf2.jpg?resize=1600:*)\n\nPHOTO: COREY FLORIN\n\nOnce your rice is perfectly seasoned and separated, it’s time to add in your eggs and peas.

    "markdown": "# Grilled chicken BLT salad - Simply Delicious\nJuicy grilled **chicken BLT salad** is everything you want from a salad and more. Crispy bacon, creamy avocado and punchy lemon-herb dressing all come together to make this salad recipe simply irresistible.\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad with avocado](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-3.jpg)\n\nIngredients needed\n------------------\n\n*   **Chicken.** I used boneless skinless chicken breasts but boneless chicken thighs will be delicious too. I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper.\n*   **Bacon.** I used streaky bacon.\n*   **Lettuce.** Use your favorite crisp lettuce. Romaine lettuce, Cos, etc.\n*   **Tomatoes.** Cherry tomatoes, baby tomatoes, baby plum tomatoes will all work.\n*   **Avocado.**\n*   **For the dressing:** Extra-virgin olive oil, dried oregano, fresh lemon juice, salt and black pepper.\n\nHow to make BLT salad\n---------------------\n\n1.  **Marinate the chicken:** Halve the chicken horizontally with a sharp knife then place in a medium bowl. Mix together the marinade ingredients and pour over the chicken. Toss to coat then allow to marinate for at least 20 minutes but up to 24 hours covered in the fridge.\n2.  **Cook the chicken and bacon:** Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium-high heat then cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. I prefer cooking the bacon in the air fryer. Alternatively bake the bacon in a hot oven until crisp or cooked to your preference.\n3.  **Assemble the salad:** Arrange lettuce on a large serving platter then top with ripe tomatoes, sliced avocado, crispy bacon and the sliced chicken. To make the dressing, combine olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and salt and pour over the salad before serving.\n\n### How to make grilled chicken for salad\n\nMake a quick marinade with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, herbs of your choice (rosemary, thyme and oregano are always a safe bet) and season generously with salt and pepper. Pour over boneless, skinless chicken breasts and allow to marinate while you heat the grill or grill pan. Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until cooked through and golden brown on both sides. The internal temperature should be 75**°**C or 165**°**F. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. You can also use **[pan fried chicken](https://simply-delicious-food.com/pan-fried-chicken-breast/)** for this recipe.\n\n### Why is it important to let meat rest after cooking?\n\nResting meat or chicken allows the juices to be redistributed throughout the meat instead of running out onto the cutting board. This is because the meat tenses up during cooking and allowing it to rest, literally allows the meat to relax and will result in juicier meat or chicken.\n\n![Grilled chicken on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-2.jpg)\n\nCan I make this ahead?\n----------------------\n\nThe chicken can be marinated for up to 24 hours in the fridge. Cooked chicken can be kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To prep the salad in advance, I would keep the dressing separate as it will cause the lettuce to wilt. Slice the avocado and dress the salad right before serving.\n\nWhat to serve with blt chicken salad\n------------------------------------\n\nThis salad is a fantastic gluten-free/keto meal on its own. If you want to add side dishes, a loaf of **[crusty bread](https://simply-delicious-food.com/easy-crusty-bread-recipe/)** is always delicious with salad.\n\n![Easy lemon-herb dressing on BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/blt-chicken-salad-4.jpg)\n\n*   **[BBQ chicken salad with charred corn](https://simply-delicious-food.com/bbq-chicken-salad-with-charred-corn/)**\n*   [**Greek chicken salad**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/greek-chicken-salad/)\n*   [**Peri-Peri chicken salad with charred corn**](https://simply-delicious-food.com/peri-peri-chicken-salad/)\n\n![Grilled chicken BLT salad](https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blt-chicken-salad-3-2-266x266.jpg)\n\n#### For the grilled chicken\n\n*   4 chicken breasts boneless + skinless\n*   2 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   2 garlic cloves crushed\n*   1 tsp salt\n*   ½ tsp black pepper\n\n#### For the salad\n\n*   8 strips streaky bacon cooked to your preference\n*   lettuce\n*   baby tomatoes halved\n*   1 avocado sliced\n\n#### For the lemon-herb dressing\n\n*   3 tbsp olive oil\n*   2 tbsp lemon juice\n*   1 tsp dried oregano\n*   salt and pepper to taste\n\n*   Combine all the marinade ingredients and mix well.

It will act as an antioxidant.\n*   Being a **cold chicken pasta salad** makes it perfect for summer, picnics or potlucks. You can make it up to a day in advance, leaving the avocado and tomato until you are ready to serve the chicken pasta salad to keep the ingredients as fresh as possible.\n\n### Can I grill chicken instead of using rotisserie chicken?\n\nYes, of course, you can **grill chicken for this salad**. Make sure to grill chicken breasts or pan-sear on medium-low heat, so chicken doesn’t burn while undercooked in the inside. When out of fresh chicken, we like to use a bag of frozen grilled organic chicken breasts that we heat up in a skillet and use for the salad.\n\n### How to Store the Chicken Pasta Salad?\n\nThis chicken pasta salad keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days if stored in an air-tight container. Don’t keep it for more than that because the avocado will turn brown. You may have to toss the chicken pasta salad leftovers to redistribute the dressing before serving. If you want to make it ahead of time, omit the avocado, you’ll add them at the very last minute.\n\n### What other readers say about this chicken pasta salad\n\n“This was so good and the perfect lunch. Changes: I added black olives, cucumber and matchstick carrots. I forgot to add the basil and it was fine without it.” – Maureen\n\n“Just made this chicken pasta salad for our dinner. Will definitely make it again. Perfect for summer. Added some fire roasted corn and served the dressing on the side with croutons.” – Nancy\n\n“Delicious! Husband loved it! Will be making it again!” – Laura\n\n“The boys ate three plates each, this salad is a keeper!” – Deja\n\n“Easy, healthy and cheap recipe; delicious!

    "markdown": "# Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe (Savory Japanese Pancakes) - A Food Lover's Kitchen\n*    votes\n*   [Jump to Recipe](#recipe)\n\nThis popular Japanese dish from Osaka, this **Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe** is a savory pancake made with cabbage, vegetable, meat or seafood, and a delicious sauce.\n\nIt’s not a difficult recipe to make, so trust me when I say it’s way more accessible to home cooks than it might look. In fact, there are many different styles of Okonomiyaki throughout Japan, not just one particular way of making it, so you can kind of do whatever version makes you happy, rather than worrying about getting it right.\n\n_» You are going to love these handcrafted [Japanese Gyoza!](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/homemade-japanese-gyoza/)_\n\n![Okonomiyaki\nEasy okonomiyaki recipe](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/okonomiyaki-t1.jpg)\n\nThe first time I had Okonomiyaki was at a supper club dinner. A friend of ours had just been to Japan and wanted to share this awesome dish with us. It was so good, I wanted to learn how to make it myself.\n\nA year later we went to Japan ourselves and we were obsessed with seeking out the best Okonomiyaki we could find. We learned that it comes in many variations, so we tried as many as possible. The version in this recipe has shrimp and bacon in it, but you can easily make it vegetarian or add chicken… whatever you like.\n\n![okonomiyaki batter](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-batter.jpg)\n\nDoes Okonomiyaki Require Special Ingredients?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOkonomiyaki is basically a savory pancake made with cabbage, flour, egg and water. Most of us keep those items in the kitchen at all times, so technically you can make a pretty decent okonomiyaki right now.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that make it extra special. These are somewhat specialty ingredients, that you don’t likely have on hand.\n\nFirst off, there is a special [okonomiyaki flour](https://amzn.to/2IFTg80) that is used in Japan. They also use [dashi](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi-3-ways/) for the liquid, rather than plain water. Both of these ingredients give the pancake something extra special. However, they are not necessary ingredients to make a great Okonomiyaki.\n\nThese Japanese pancakes are best served with a few key toppings, including [Okonomiyaki sauce](https://amzn.to/2xi8o4R), [Japanese mayonnaise](https://amzn.to/2X2wX5f), [bonito flakes](https://amzn.to/3UXrck4), and seaweed. I personally can get all of these items from a Japanese shop near my house, but I realize they can be difficult to find. Don’t worry.\n\nWhile these pancakes are best when served with all these toppings, it’s by no means a requirement. Below, we will suggested substitutions for the difficult to find ingredients.\n\n![spicy mayo and okonomiyaki sauce](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-sauce.jpg)\n\nHow to Make This Easy Okonomiyaki Recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe most important part of making this recipe is ensuring the cabbage is softened, since fresh cabbage contains a lot of water. You don’t want to make soggy pancakes.\n\nTo avoid this, you need to salt the cabbage and allow it to sweat off some of its water. Then rinse the salt from the cabbage and dry it thoroughly with paper towels.\n\nI also find that the cabbage is best when it’s chopped into rather small pieces – the size of a dime or slightly smaller. The larger it is, the longer it takes to cook and less surface area for the pancake to brown on the grill.\n\nMix up the batter, add the pre-sweated cabbage and other ingredients, and you’re ready to go. Pour the batter onto a hot griddle. An [electric griddle](https://amzn.to/2LUg1qr \"Electric Griddle\") like this one is perfect for the task, but you can just use a flat [crepe pan](https://amzn.to/30SoG41 \"Crepe pan\") as well.\n\nSpread out the batter to form a 5-inch round pancake. You can flatten out the batter and cabbage so it forms a flat cake, rather than a mountain, but be careful not to pack it down or press it into the grill. It needs the flow of steam to cook the cabbage properly.\n\n![cooking okonomiyaki on the griddle](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/okonomiyaki-cooking.jpg)\n\nAllow it to cook, undisturbed, for about 5 minutes. When it’s golden brown on the bottom, flip it over. It’ll need to cook an additional 5 minutes on the other side for the cabbage to cook thoroughly.\n\nWhen it’s done, remove it from the pan and cover it with your toppings of choice. I start with a drizzle of Okonomi sauce, then some mayo or [Sriracha](https://amzn.to/3O69c2g \"Sriracha\") mayo (which add an extra spicy kick). You can stop there. Or you can also add bonito flakes, some scallions, seaweed flakes, etc.\n\nIf you can’t get Okonomi sauce near your home, you can get it on Amazon. You could also substitute it with a homemade sauce made from ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce and sugar.\n\n[Here’s a recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki-sauce/) I use sometimes when I don’t have the real sauce on hand. It’s also acceptable to use BBQ sauce, if you don’t want to make the effort to mix up your own sauce.\n\n![Okonomiyaki](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/okonomiyaki-w2.jpg)\n\nI’ve made this many times at home and I’m always surprised and happy with how well they turn out. They’re crispy on the outside, while still airy and light on the inside.\n\nThe cabbage gets steamed nicely while it’s on the griddle, so it’s no longer crunchy, but not soggy either.\n\nOf course, the sauce is a huge part of the equation too. Without the sauce, the pancake alone lacks luster. With the sauce, the flavors come together nicely to form one tasty pancake.\n\n### Other recipes you might like\n\n*   [BBQ Pork Belly Slices](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/bbq-pork-belly-slices-recipe/)\n*   [Vietnamese Pork Bowls](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/vietnamese-pork-bowls/)\n*   [The Best Crispy Chicken Sandwich](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/crispy-chicken-sandwich/)\n\n### YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\n**Like it, Love it, Want Some More of It?** [Subscribe to our newsletter](https://app.zagomail.com/forms/preview?id=5092) and **follow us** on **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/foodloverskitchen/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/afoodloverskitchen/)** and **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/afoodloverskitchen/)**.

You can make it yourself, or purchase it.\n*   2 large eggs\n*   1/4 teaspoon (2 g) salt divided into two\n*   1/8 teaspoon (0.5 g) sugar\n*   2 cups (140 g) diced green cabbage dime-sized pieces\n*   1/4 cup (25 g) chopped green onion\n*   1/4 cup (59 g) cooked lardons substitute bacon, roughly chopped\n*   1/4 cup (59 g) small cooked shrimp\n*   1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil or butter\n\n#### For garnish\n\n*   1/4 cup (59 g) bonito flakes\n*   1/8 cup (28 g) mayonnaise this is easiest to use when in a squirt bottle\n*   1/8 cup (30 ml) Okonomiyaki sauce substitute with homemade sauce\n*   1/8 cup (0.63 g) seaweed flakes substitute with cut strips of nori\n\n*   Put the cabbage in a medium glass bowl. Cover with 1/8 teaspoon of salt and mix well to coat all of the cabbage. Allow it to sit for about 15 minutes. Rinse the cabbage and dry it well with paper towels.\n    \n*   Mix the flour, water, eggs, remaining salt, and sugar in a bowl. Once mixed, add the cabbage, green onion, lardons and shrimp. Stir well.\n    \n*   Heat a flat griddle or [crepe pan](https://amzn.to/30SoG41 \"Crepe pan\") to medium. Add the olive oil to the pan. Pour the Okonomiyaki batter into a round pancake shape in the center of the pan.\n    \n*   Cook for 3-4 minutes, until golden brown on the griddle side. Carefully flip the pancake over and cook an additional 3-4 minutes, until golden brown. Check the center with a fork to make sure the batter is cooked through.\n    \n*   Top the hot pancake with drizzles of Okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise. Top with bonito flakes and seaweed, if desired. Serve while hot.\n    \n\n*   The Okonomiyaki flour can be substituted with “00” flour, plus 1/2 tsp baking powder.\n*   The cabbage needs to be chopped into small pieces, the size of a dime or slightly smaller. Large pieces make it harder to cook properly.\n\nCalories: 644kcal | Carbohydrates: 53g | Protein: 43g | Fat: 26g | Saturated Fat: 6g | Cholesterol: 272mg | Sodium: 1098mg | Potassium: 546mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 463IU | Vitamin C: 29mg | Calcium: 98mg | Iron: 5mg\n\n![Laura Lynch](https://afoodloverskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lauralynch-sm.jpg)\n\nLaura is a home cook, with 25 years experience behind the stove, who spends an extraordinary amount of time in the kitchen cooking.

I’m loving how much flavor I find in every morsel I eat. One thing I have noticed is they add larger quantities of spices and herbs than I’m used to using. I’m always afraid of adding too much. This journey has shown me differently. Not only the quantity used but the combination of flavors. It’s SO good!\n\nNot only am I exploring foods from other countries but I’m looking for anything that can be put on the grill or smoker. It’s just downright “HOT” in the south.

Tender chicken is tossed in a spicy and creamy roasted tomatillo sauce for a flavor kick!_\n\n![Healthy Chicken Tomatillo Quinoa Bowls](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wholesome-chicken-tomatillo-and-quinoa-black-bean-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhen you go to your favorite Mexican restaurant are you a red sauce or green sauce fan? I used to be all about the earthy creamy red sauce poured on top of burritos, enchiladas or stewed meat. Then one day I had a change of heart when I had the most incredible plate of pork Chile Verde. I’ve been itching to learn how to make tomatillo sauce that could I use for just about any meal.\n\nToday I’m sharing a healthy chicken tomatillo bowl! You will learn how to make the sauce from scratch paired with a creamy, and spicy chicken topped on a bed of [cooked quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/how-to-cook-quinoa/). I will leave the rest of the extra toppings up to you, but at least you’ll have the essential recipe.\n\n![a sheet pan filled with green tomatillos](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fresh-tomatillos-onions-pasilla-chilis-garlic-for-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nWhat are Tomatillos?\n--------------------\n\nYou may have seen them hanging out next to the hot peppers in the produce aisle, but have you dared to cook with them? To be honest, I was a little hesitant at first, but I gave it a shot. Here are the basics of using tomatillos in cooking.\n\n*   Tomatillos are a member of the nightshade family. They are wrapped in a wrinkly paper husk, and once you remove the outer layer a gorgeous candy-apple green colored fruit appears. You’ll notice a slightly sticky film on the thick tomatillo flesh, but once cooked the skin softens and a tangy, fruity, herbal flavor emerges.\n*   Tomatillos can be diced up and eaten raw like for salsas, but have a more tart flavor. To add to a quick sauce, they can be blanched for about 5 minutes or until tender, then further blended or crushed for salsas, enchilada sauce, soups, or spreads.\n*   To add extra earthy flavors to the tomatillos, you can broil, fire-roast or oven roast the tomatoes like for this chicken tomatillo bowl recipe. I found that this adds additional depth in flavors, and they practically melt in the oven.\n\n![making green salsa with peppers and onions](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/oven-roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-600x900.jpg)\n\nThe base for the tomatillo sauce is, of course, the green fruit to add it’s characteristic tangy flavor, jalapeno, and pasilla (or poblano) peppers for heat, caramelized purple onions for sweetness and buttery roasted garlic for earthiness.\n\nCheck out how all of the fruit, vegetables, and aromatics just melt together in the pan after roasting. So many incredible flavors in one place, divine!\n\n![side by side before and after photos of sauce ingredients from solid to puree](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-spicy-tomatillo-sauce-before-and-after-blending-600x450.jpg)\n\nNow it’s time to bring the sauce components together! Chicken broth and fresh parsley are added to the roasted ingredients, then pureed in my Vitamix Blender until smooth.\n\nSo the first taste I took off the tomatillo salsa, it was SPICY! If you want more of a mild sauce, remove the seeds and inner membranes of the jalapenos and pasilla peppers before roasting. Or even add just one jalapeno instead of two. However once I added some yogurt to the sauce, that helped bring down the heat. This recipe makes a lot of sauce so that you can use it for another meal like [enchiladas](https://www.jessicagavin.com/chicken-enchiladas-with-pumpkin-sauce/), or even as a salsa with some crunchy chips!\n\n![chicken breasts being seared in a pan](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/spiced-sauteed-chicken-breast-600x900.jpg)\n\nLet’s talk POLLO. For the shredded chicken, I like to add a generous amount of spices for flavor, and a short [saute](https://www.jessicagavin.com/sauteing/) so that the chicken stays nice and juicy. You can bake, or poach the chicken, but I like the flavors developed on the surface from the sear with the sauteed chicken. If you are in a pinch for time, grab a roasted chicken from the store and shred away.\n\n![spoon mixing green sauce with shredded chicken](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/creamy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-1-600x900.jpg)\n\nOh yea, check out this creamy green goodness! The spicy tomatillo sauce gets combined with just a touch of plain Greek yogurt to add a creamy texture to each bite. The yogurt also helps to back the heat a bit, but it’s still got a nice kick! The sauce and the chicken get tossed together, and it’s ready for bowl customization.\n\n![top down view of two bowls of chicken tomatillo served on top of quinoa](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/healthy-spicy-roasted-tomatillo-chicken-bowls-with-quinoa-600x900.jpg)\n\nIt’s topping time! I like a balance of textures and making sure I get a variety of colors for extra nutritional benefits. I add sliced radishes, limes, chopped red onions, black beans, diced avocado and tomatoes to the bowl. The additional protein, fiber, and phytonutrients make this a healthy meal that you will crave!\n\n![close of up a chicken quinoa bowl](https://www.jessicagavin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roasted-tomatillo-chicken-and-quinoa-bowl-600x900.jpg)\n\nGrab a fork and let’s dig in! If you are having guests over you can create a build-your-own chicken bowl bar and put out different toppings and even have brown rice or vegetable noodles to fill. What other tasty dishes would you add the tomatillo sauce? I would love to hear so I can try!\n\nHow do you pick ripe tomatillos?\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen tomatillos are ripe, they are juicy, firm and tart. A few guidelines when you are at the market to pick ripe tomatillos are go for smaller sizes. They tend to be a little sweeter. Slightly peel back the husk and look for bright green colored fruit. This will yield a more tangy fruit which is what you want in your dish. Pale yellow or light green tomatillo will be overripe but less tart. Touch the outside of the husk and look for it to be sticky and not dry and the fruit should fill most of the husk. Pick firm tomatillos, if it’s too soft, it’s past it’s prime.\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   ▢ 20 tomatillos\n*   ▢ 2 jalapeño peppers, stems removed\n*   ▢ 3 pasilla chilies, or poblanos, stems removed\n*   ▢ ½ red onion, cut in half\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n*   ▢ 5 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole\n*   ▢ 1 cup unsalted chicken broth, or stock\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, packed\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons nonfat plain Greek yogurt, or lowfat sour cream\n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   ▢ 1 cup quinoa\n*   ▢ 2 cups water\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt\n*   ▢ 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to ¾-inch thick\n*   ▢ black pepper\n*   ▢ [paprika](https://www.jessicagavin.com/what-is-paprika/)\n*   ▢ 1 tablespoon [olive oil](https://amzn.to/491qTuY)\n\n#### Tomatillo Sauce\n\n*   Pre-heat oven to 425°F. Remove the paper off of the tomatillos and place them on a large baking pan. Add jalapeño peppers, pasilla chilies and cut red onion to the same pan.\n    \n*   Drizzle the chilies with one tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n    \n*   Place the peeled garlic in foil, lightly drizzle with oil and wrap into a packet that is open from the top, place on the corner of the baking pan. Roast chilies, onion, and garlic for 40 minutes stirring chilies after 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa and chicken.\n    \n*   Transfer the roasted chilies, onions, garlic and any juice on the pan to a blender or food processor. Add chicken broth, one teaspoon salt, and cilantro to the blender. Pulse on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce is smooth.\n    \n*   Add 2 cups of sauce to a large saute pan and set aside. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce. You only need 2 cups. Save the extra sauce in the refrigerator for five days, or freeze.\n    \n\n#### Chicken Quinoa Bowls\n\n*   Add 1 cup quinoa to a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse well with running water. Transfer to a pot with lid. Add 2 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt.\n    \n*   Bring to a boil, put a lid on then reduce to a simmer, over medium-low heat. Allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until water is absorbed, then turn off the heat. Allow it to sit with the lid on for at least 5 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork when ready to serve.\n    \n*   Evenly season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side, or until chicken is no longer pink. Transfer to a clean plate.\n    \n*   Once slightly cooled shred chicken into smaller pieces. Transfer to the saute pan that has 2 cups of tomatillo sauce. Turn heat to medium and warm chicken and sauce until hot. Turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons yogurt. Taste season with more salt and pepper as desired.\n    \n*   Assemble bowls with quinoa, add tomatillo chicken and other desired toppings.\n    \n\n*   **Additional Topping Suggestions**: Sliced limes, radishes, cilantro, diced onion, tomatoes, black beans, sour cream, and avocado.\n\nCalories 320kcal (16%)Carbohydrates 29g (10%)Protein 27g (54%)Fat 12g (18%)Saturated Fat 2g (10%)Polyunsaturated Fat 2gMonounsaturated Fat 7gCholesterol 71mg (24%)Sodium 1122mg (47%)Potassium 542mg (15%)Fiber 4g (16%)Sugar 5g (6%)Vitamin A 250IU (5%)Vitamin C 37.1mg (45%)Calcium 30mg (3%)Iron 3.4mg (19%)\n\nPercent Daily Values are based on a 2000-calorie diet.

But, if you’re a fan of a creamy pasta salad, or an ultra easy-to-make pasta salad that’s loaded with healthier goodness (plus bacon!), this avocado and bacon pasta salad is for you.\n\nOnce the garden tomatoes come into harvest, BLT sandwiches are a staple at our house. And the only thing that makes them even better is adding avocado for them to become BLATs. Bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato sandwiches that are now a BBQ pasta salad staple.\n\nSo when my daughter requested I make a pasta salad that included her beloved bacon in the BLT mix, avocado was an obvious addition to make.\n\n[![BLT pasta salad ingredients in glass bowl](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-005-2-1.jpg)\n\nBLT Pasta Salad Ingredients\n---------------------------\n\nI’m sure you can already guess the key ingredients in this BLT pasta salad recipe, but I added in a few more veggies to add extra pops of flavor. Instead of lettuce, I used peppery arugula, which pairs beautifully with the ranch pasta salad dressing. And I prefer using cherry tomatoes in this BLT pasta salad because they’re so juicy and hold their shape nicely.\n\nThe other ingredients you’ll need for this potluck side dish are:\n\n*   Pasta\n*   Bacon\n*   Cherry tomatoes\n*   Arugula\n*   Avocado\n*   Red onion\n*   Greek yogurt\n*   Mayonnaise\n*   White vinegar\n*   Chives\n*   Parsley\n*   Garlic powder\n*   Salt and pepper\n\nThe pasta salad dressing is a little healthier, because I used Greek yogurt instead of full flavored mayonnaise and sour cream. But thanks to the fresh herbs it has a totally fresh and delicious flavor.\n\nAs with any cold pasta salad, taste the dressing after you’ve whisked it together to see if it needs more salt or pepper. It’s much easier to season the dressing before it’s been tossed with the pasta!\n\n[![container of greek yogurt next to sliced red onion on counter](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-002.jpg)\n\nHow to Make BLT Pasta Salad\n---------------------------\n\nTo make this homemade pasta salad, you’ll first need to cook the pasta noodles according to the package’s instructions. I tend to undercook my pasta just a bit for pasta salads so it doesn’t turn to mush as it absorbs the salad dressing.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, dice the bacon and cook it until it reaches your desired level of crispness. Note that you won’t have to oil the pan before cooking the bacon in it as the bacon will release a good amount of fat as it cooks.\n\nOnce the pasta has cooled slightly and the bacon and veggies have been prepped, add everything to a large bowl and toss to combine.\n\nNext up is the dressing. This pasta salad dressing is so easy to make, and is an easier rendition of [my homemade Ranch dressing](https://www.foodiecrush.com/homemade-ranch-dressing-recipe/) for saucing this easy pasta salad. In a separate bowl, whisk together the homemade ranch dressing. Pour the dressing over the BLT pasta salad and gently stir to distribute it.\n\n[![Homemade Ranch Dressing Recipe | foodiecrush.com](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Homemade-Ranch-Dressing-foodiecrush.com-005.jpg)\n\nCan I Use Fat-Free Greek Yogurt?\n--------------------------------\n\nPersonally, I would steer clear of using fat-free yogurt in this homemade pasta salad. Fat-free yogurts are often loaded with additives to make up for their flavor, and have a tendency to separate. Stick to low-fat or whole milk plain Greek yogurt for this recipe.\n\nThe Best Pastas for Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nI like this pasta salad best with a short pasta noodle, and like in my [Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/)  I use my favorite shell noodle. But, there are quite a few other types you can try, like:\n\n*   Farfalle (bowtie or butterflies)\n*   Gemelli (twists)\n*   Fusilli (springs)\n*   Campanelle (flowers)\n*   Penne (tubes)\n*   Orichette (ears)\n\nAlways cook your pasta in water that’s been generously salted. I always prefer kosher salt to regular table or iodized salt because it’s not as harsh due to its larger, flakier crystals.\n\n[![BLT Pasta Salad with Avocado | foodiecrush.com #pasta #salad #BLT #bacon #tomato #avocado #recipes](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-013.jpg)\n\nCan I Prep This Pasta Salad in Advance?\n---------------------------------------\n\nI actually prefer my pasta salads to be served chilled, so yes, you can definitely prep this bacon pasta salad in advance. Just note that the longer the bacon sits in the dressing, the less crisp it will be when you serve this pasta salad.\n\nWith that said, this BLT pasta salad will be fine if you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to serving it. This will give the flavors time to come together.\n\nCan I Double This BLT Pasta Salad Recipe?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re making this pasta salad for a backyard BBQ or potluck party, you can easily double the recipe if you’ll be feeding a _lot_ of people. One pound of pasta makes a lot of pasta salad, and the salad as-is serves 12 or more, but will stretch further if you’re serving other salads or side dishes along with it.\n\n[![close up of avocado and bacon pasta salad](http://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.foodiecrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BLT-Pasta-Salad-foodiecrush.com-009.jpg)\n\nTips for Making BLT Pasta Salad\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you’re out of ingredients or out of time to make the easy homemade dressing, feel free to use a quality bottled ranch dressing instead.\n\nWe prefer using classic pork bacon to make this BLT pasta salad, but you’re welcome to use any type of bacon you’d like.\n\nOne final note: the sliced avocado will brown as it sits in this BLT pasta salad. Personally, I don’t mind eating brown avocado (it’s perfectly safe to eat!), but if that’s something you’re worried about you can wait to stir it in until just before you serve this homemade pasta salad.\n\nMore Pasta Salad Ideas to Try\n-----------------------------\n\n*   [Classic Shrimp and Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/classic-shrimp-macaroni-salad-recipe/) (this one always gets raves)\n*   [Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto](https://www.foodiecrush.com/craving-5-recipes-for-creamy-macaroni-salad/ \"Macaroni Salad with Smoked Mozzarella and Proscuitto\")\n*   [Easy Italian Spaghetti Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/easy-italian-spaghetti-pasta-salad/)\n*   [Creamy Tuscan Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/tuscan-pasta-salad/)\n*   [How to Make Classic Macaroni Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-classic-macaroni-salad/) (because classics always win!)\n*   [Kale Caesar Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/kale-caesar-pasta-salad/ \"Kale Caesar Pasta Salad\")\n*   [Greek Pasta Salad](https://www.foodiecrush.com/greek-pasta-salad-cucumbers-artichoke-hearts/)\n\n**If you mak****e this recipe, please let me know!

    "markdown": "# Slow Cooker Garlic Butter Chicken and Veggies - The Magical Slow Cooker\nMake **garlic butter chicken** with veggies right in your slow cooker. Chicken tenderloins, baby carrots and gold potatoes are cooked to perfection in a homemade garlic butter sauce.\n\nIf you love easy chicken recipes, try my [slow cooker chicken stew](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-chicken-stew/) recipe and [slow cooker cranberry chicken](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-cranberry-chicken/) recipes.\n\n![chicken with potatoes and carrots in crockpot.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-5.jpg)\n\n \n\nWhy this recipe works\n---------------------\n\nThis recipe isn’t for the faint of heart, this is for my butter loving friends. A stick of butter flavors this meal, but the entire meal. I add garlic, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper to a stick of melted butter. I pour that garlic butter mixture over chicken, carrots, and wedges of Yukon gold potatoes.\n\nNot all slow cooker meals end up being complete meals; I usually have to make a starchy side or make a salad. With this recipe, all the main food groups are covered. The chicken is tender, and so are the veggies. My favorite thing about this meal is the potatoes. There is something about butter and potatoes together that just can’t be beaten. I hope you give this recipe a try! It’s hearty like a pot roast dinner, but with chicken instead. Have a great week. I’ll be back at the end of the week with another recipe.\n\nRecipe Ingredients\n------------------\n\n![Ingredients for garlic butter chicken and vegetables on table.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-ingredients-2.jpg)\n\n*   **Chicken tenderloins** – These cook up perfectly and soak up the garlic butter. You can use boneless skinless chicken breasts if that’s all you have.\n*   **Carrots** – Use one pound of baby carrots or one pound of carrots cut into 1 inch chunks.\n*   **Gold Potatoes** – You can use red or gold potatoes, but we LOVE gold potatoes in this recipe.\n*   **Garlic Butter Sauce** – Salted butter, fresh minced garlic, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper.\n\nStep-by-Step Directions\n-----------------------\n\n![4 steps on how to add chicken, vegetables and garlic butter sauce to slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-collage-1-1200x1200.jpg)\n\n**Step One** – In a small bowl, add the melted salted butter and add minced garlic, salt, pepper, dried thyme, and dried parsley.\n\n**Step Two** –   Place chicken tenders (or breasts) in the middle of the slow cooker. On one side of that place wedges of Yukon gold potatoes and on the other a bag of baby carrots.\n\n**Step Three** – Pour the garlic butter mixture over the chicken and veggies.\n\n**Step Four** – Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours. Serve and enjoy! Plenty of buttery sauce for everyone!\n\n![cooked garlic butter chicken in slow cooker.](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/garlic-butter-chicken-and-veggies-photos-2.jpg)\n\nVariations\n----------\n\n*   **Green beans** – Green beans cook up so well in the slow cooker, use them instead of the carrots for this garlic butter chicken recipe.\n*   **Easy Peasy** – Instead of making a garlic butter sauce. Use 2/3 cup of Italian dressing.\n*   **Lemon Chicken** – Add the juice of one large lemon to the garlic butter sauce.

Be sure not to burn the garlic. Remove from heat and stir in honey.\n3.  **Coat and Roast**: Toss the carrots with the prepared sauce, season to taste, and bake in a 425°F oven for 22 to 25 minutes, or until tender.\n4.  **Garnish and Serve**: Add a sprinkle of fresh parsley for a beautiful presentation.\n\nHow Long To Roast Carrots\n-------------------------\n\nThe carrots will need to roast for 20 to 25 minutes in a 425˚F oven.\n\nShould You Peel The Carrots Before Roasting?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nI peel the carrots because they look cleaner, but it’s not necessary.

Reheat the carrots on the stove for the best results. Just toss them in a pan with a dab of butter and warm them over medium-low heat until heated through.\n*   **Baby Carrots:** You can use baby carrots for this recipe. Just follow the same steps, but you might need to tweak or shorten the cooking time a little, so keep an eye on them.\n*   **Different Sweeteners**: Instead of honey, you could use maple syrup or brown sugar.\n*   **Add Spices**: Experiment with adding spices like [cumin](https://diethood.com/what-is-cumin/), cinnamon, or chili flakes to bring a new depth of flavor. A pinch of smoked [paprika](https://diethood.com/what-is-paprika/) can add a smoky taste.\n*   **Include Other Veggies**: Toss the carrots with other chopped root vegetables like parsnips, turnips, or sweet potatoes. They’ll all absorb the delicious garlic butter glaze.\n*   **Use Different Herbs**: Fresh or dried herbs such as thyme, rosemary, or dill can be added to the glaze.\n\n![Glazed roasted carrots served in a baking dish.](https://diethood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Honey-Garlic-Butter-Roasted-Carrots-9.jpg \"Honey Garlic Butter Roasted Carrots Recipe - Easy, simple, wonderfully delicious roasted carrots prepared with the most incredible garlic butter and sweet honey sauce.\")\n\nServing Suggestions\n-------------------\n\nThese roasted carrots go wonderfully with a variety of main dishes.
